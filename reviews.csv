leitch,1,,INST377,"Professor is so rude and sarcastic. She is very knowledgeable in this field, but her sarcastic tone/personality makes me really dislike her as a person and professor. She calls on random people in class and tells them off if they get the answer wrong. She doesn't even lecture or teach; she goes on long tangents in class. Worst prof I've had at UMD.",11
leitch,3,A,,"Constantly threatens to report students to the Office of Student Conduct if we say/do certain things. Yes, we know that we're not supposed to use offensive slurs or copy the work of our classmates. We're not paying literal tens of thousands of dollars to hear this repeated to us every lecture. I will say that the way some of the classes were taught forced me to learn everything on my own as I didn't find any of the source material to be useful, so take that how you will in regards to the teaching style.",11
leitch,5,A+,INST377,"Professor Alex is a great at handling the  teaching for INST377. While it is true that they are sometimes sarcastic, their jokes are meant to lighten the mood and never to harm any of the students. Office hours are always long and engaging, and so is lecture. Professor gives a wide variety of resources to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript, and is always willing to teach things in multiple ways for students who may not take well to a specific method.",11
leitch,1,,INST377,This course was very disorganized. The workload was demanding and she didn't provide a lot of support until after the projects were due. I wouldn't recommend taking INST377 with her,11
doran,5,A,INST311,I've learned a lot through his online class. He's a very lenient grader and gives great feedback on papers. There tends to be one discussion post and one quiz per week but those are very simple if you remember to look through the slides. ,20
chan_joel,5,A+,INST126,"Joel has a passion for helping students understand the material. Is more than helpful to try and figure out issues you may be having, but also emphasizes the importance of being able to figure out a solution on your own, even if you have to ""google it""",23

heidenblad,2,,INST346,Get ready to learn absolutely nothing. He designs the course to be extremely difficult for no reason. The material he presents with his lectures are often confusing and difficult to apply to the series of labs assigned throughout the semester and homework assignments. ,26
heidenblad,4,A+,INST346,"Donal is a good professor, he relays information well and is organized. Grades easy but could be TA's",26
heidenblad,4,A+,INST346,"The only reason I give him 4 stars is because labs are difficult, but he grades very easily. Even with a 6/10 on two labs my grade is still a 99. You just have to turn in assignments on time and follow the rubric and you're good. ",26
heidenblad,5,A-,INST346,"he's extremely helpful during office hours and is a very forgiving professor, although the assignments are hard he is very responsive when you ask for help on them ",26
heidenblad,5,A,INST346,"Very helpful and knowledgable about course material. Always helpful when asked questions and genuinely a very nice guy. Though his meme game may need some work, his course structure and willingness to help students understand and learn material are very good. Highly recommend him for this course!",26
oard,4,A+,INST154,"Doug is clearly passionate about what he's teaching which makes class enjoyable. Lectures are pretty much a 50 minute monologue on the space program/ background of Apollo with a 25 minute table discussion. Personally, I found the lectures to be fascinating but the discussions were fairly useless. The class overall is fairly easy. There are 3 essays and as long as you follow the rubric you'll get an A. Readings are a mixed bag; some are really interesting, others, not so much. ",27
oard,4,,INST154,"The 3 major grades are 2 papers and one group project. They aren't hard per se but you will have to put in the effort. You'll also have to do readings for quizzes but no exams to worry about. Overall, it's a good class experience.",27
oard,5,A,INST154,"Fascinating course for those interested in the Apollo program. Classes were fairly engaging, 3 major grades one of which is a group project but it doesn’t require a lot of collaboration. No tests Professor Oard is very knowledgeable on the topic and very helpful, wants you to succeed. ",27
oard,5,A+,INST154,"Doug loves teaching about Apollo, and the material can get technical at times but is almost always interesting. Doug can answer virtually any question imaginable, and makes the class fun. There's no tests, only writing assignments which aren't super long.",27
weaver,2,B+,INST354,"Not the most organized professor, assignments are not clear, class took a hard left and didn't follow the same track as other 354 classes.",34
weaver,4,A,INST354,"Dr. Weaver is a kind person that is passionate about teaching. While I did not personally agree with some of her teaching styles (no phones/laptops in class, mandatory check-in at the beginning of each class, etc.), she still does a decent job of conveying material and is receptive to the needs of her students.",34
hassan_naeemul,3,,JOUR152,"Prof. Hassan is ok. He does his best to make the class interesting in the weekly modules by telling us what the career paths are we could take based on the information, but the class still felt like a chore instead of something I enjoyed. I think that's down to the asynchronous nature of the class - if you're interested in coding, you'll enjoy the class, otherwise you won't.",36
golbeck,5,A,,"I'm not sure why everyone is hating on Jen. If you take the time to talk to her, she can help you out a lot. Yes, you definitely have to be proactive with her. It's hard to find her, but generally she's available after class or if you make an appointment with her. Make sure you take advantage of her while she is in class to get facetime. None of her classes are really that hard or boring in context, and she's generous with grading.",37
golbeck,5,A,,"ok, she gives us a lot of things to read. like really, A LOT. BUT, as long as you just read and know the main point (just go through it once, know what the readings are about), you'll definitely get through the quizzes. (yeah, the readings are mostly for the quizzes. so, you have to read them somehow.)

but all in all, she's really nice! and she enjoys it if you participate more in the class. and... she's VERY VERY generous in her marking! so, if you've done your homework/do pretty well in your quizzes, you'll def get an A! :D believe me!",37
golbeck,3,A-,INST462,"I think the main problem is that there are so many assignments and only 1 TA. My class had around 93 people and only one TA. This means our assignments took forever to get graded. Another issue is that some of the assignments had very unclear grading criteria. The class was hard per se but the overworked TA and unclear grading criteria were the class much harder than it needed to be. I did, however, learn a lot of new visualization tools from her class that I have used in my other classes so I'm very thankful for that. ",37
golbeck,5,A,INST673,"Great professor! This class was entirely online during the winter semester. The lecture videos were done really well, and none of the assignments were particularly difficult. The only concern I have is that Weka doesn't seem that widely used, but this class is a decent introduction to a few ways that machine learning algorithms are analyzed in the real world.",37
golbeck,5,A,INFM289I,awesome,37
golbeck,3,A+,INST155,"If you read any reviews about this class that say ""it's extremely difficult"" or ""Golbeck is not a good teacher"", I strongly disagree. INST155 is certainly different than its description on Testudo, but it's not a difficult class. The basis of the class is around social network analysis and using a software named Gephi. If you are unsure about this class, look up Gephi and what it's about. I didn't love Gephi, but this class is still an easy A for someone who at least puts in some effort. 
There are about 5 ""major"" assignments that you are graded for in this class; I say ""major"" because most are only 10 points and super easy if you follow Golbeck's Youtube tutorials. You technically have weekly modules to complete which consists of one discussion board post, but the posts are only worth 1 grade point and they aren't due until the end of the semester. So, you could get them over with early or procrastinate and do them at the end of the semester.
Be aware that you are committing to an online class! It might require some more self teaching and discipline than a normal class, but if you are okay with that then this class will be super easy. Golbeck is very understanding and offered so many extensions and extra credit. 
I was in a GroupMe for this class in which many (lazy) kids complained about this class being more work than a 100-level class, but I am a first year student and thought it was comparable to my other 100-level courses. If you are a good student and do your work, you will get an A in this class.",37
golbeck,2,B,INST155,"This class was unreasonably difficult for a 100 level Gen Ed class. Golbeck was almost never accessible through email, and when she was, she was needlessly rude. Gephi projects were very vague and confusing, with one 1500 word paper and also getting 10K interactions on social media for a full grade!! That is a ridiculous assignment for an instructor to give. Don't expect regrades from TAs either. Avoid if possible.",37
golbeck,1,P,INST155,Way too much work for a 100 level class. A lot of the assignments were unreasonable and took forever. Go with another Gen-Ed. ,37
vitak,5,,INST201,Great professor she really does try to make things interesting for the class. She does make you do a meme group project. Her tests are easy and she doesn't make the class overly difficult. ,39

fenlon,5,A,INST311,"This is her first year teaching, but she is a great professor. She cares a lot of about her students success and listens to student feedback. Most of the material isn't too complicated, but she teaches the material pretty well. Be prepared for a lot of in-class activities that count towards a participation grade, so attendance is mandatory. However, I missed a few lectures and my grade wasn't really affected so just don't miss a ton. Overall, she is a great addition to UMD!",45
fenlon,5,,,"She's super nice and caring. She provides amazing feedback and always tries to help out students to the best of her ability. I was torn between the data science and the new digital curation specialization but after her class, I'm going to continue n the digital curation route. I even missed a quiz in her class and she created a whole new quiz for people who forgot to take it. Overall she's an amazing professor and I'm honored to be taught by her this semester.",45
o'grady,4,A,INST201,Took online. Chill professor. Your grade vs the effort you put in will depend on a lot TA since TA grades a lot of the assignments. ,47
o'grady,5,A+,INST311,"His recorded lectures are great - straight forward, easy to understand. Work is not too lax but not too stressful. For the online class, it was usually a discussion, an ILRA, and a response to his lecture video (usually just three bullet points you learned) each week. Sometimes there was a quiz, sometimes there wasn't. Sometimes there was a part of your final project due, sometimes there wasn't. He also responded to my emails quickly and his TA was really nice and critically helpful when grading/leaving comments. ",47

sauter,5,A,INST201,"was concerned since she had no reviews, but INST201 was interesting, and not that hard at all. i took it online, but her in person lecture is probably fine too. the quizzes and discussion boards were pretty easy, and you do a semester-long group project, for which i had a good group for. overall take her for inst201. she is nice and knowledgeable, and i feel she is on the same page as college students and is quite up to date on what's going around on social media and the world. ",48
sauter,5,A,INST201,"Prof. Sauter is amazing. Their lectures are super interesting, comedic, and relatable. There are no exams, only occasional 5 questions quizzes based on the lectures. The only downside is that your final project (and many of the assignments throughout the semester) are with an assigned group of 4-5. I got stuck doing all the work.  TAKE THIS PROFESSOR'S CLASS.  ",48
sauter,5,A+,INST441,Awesome professor. They're helpful and knowledgable on a lot of topics. The work itself is pretty easy and Dr. Sauter will have no problem helping answering and questions or concerns you may have about the subject material or assignments.

He got all his negative reviews removed from ratemyprofessor",57
piety,1,,INST335,"Piety is without a doubt, one of the worst professors I have ever had at UMD. Piety refuses to acknowledge when he makes a mistake and won't listen to anyone who may be even insinuating that he may have done some wrong (even if it's something as small as asking clarification about a rubric). He refused to respond to any of my emails with my concerns about a grade on an assignment under the excuse of ""only the group project leader can email me"" and then ignored my project leader when she attempted to contact him.

He even refused to accept doctors notes from students who had diseases such as the hand foot and mouth disease. He gave people with valid doctors notes 0s and acted defiant when confronted about how this is completely in violation of university policy.

Recently, I found out that professors can report and have negative reviews about themselves deleted from RateMyProfessor. I submit a negative review about him back in December, which was approved and posted to his page. His page used to have several negative reviews, and I learned recently (through a UMD subreddit post) that they were all deleted.",57

piety,4,A,INST126,"Not sure why he has all these awful reviews, I haven's had any of these problems. He's been very responsive, reasonable, and understanding. Some assignments seemed a little sloppy, but I think they were made mostly by the TA. He lectures relatively well, somewhat engaging but makes some mistakes occsaionally.
Overall, one of the more engaging and reasonable professors I've had, but execution is slightly sloppy.",57

piety,1,B,INST126,he is a horrible professor. don't take him. he drops your letter grade by 1. he does that every semester,57
piety,1,A,,the worst professor in the infosci department. a terrible lecturer who doesn't even understand what he's doing. also so rude and mean to students. doesn't prepare students for future class. taught myself. ,57
paletz,5,A,INST335,"Super sweet. Interested in what she is teaching. Helpful and accommodating. Overall, very nice professor! ",64
clegg,2,A-,INST362,"I DO NOT recommend you take this professor. Too much busywork during lectures. Forces you to have mini-group work acitivities where alot of people are either not interested in activity or don't understand the concepts because the professor went over them too quickly. Forces students to participate ALOT more than other professors and makes students get a webcam + mic for online class when it's not really necessary for all but one group activity.  This is a pain for students just taking her course as a major requirement.  She wants webcams turnt on 100% of them time to make students hold each other ""accountable"" and to make the learning experience better. The webcams "" mandatory always on"" policy has not helped students learned better and has annoyed students more than anything else.  Quizzes have questions on the minute details of the readings.  Finally she does have mid-semester evaluations, where she gets evaluations from students but she has not really listened to the major complaints the class has and insists that she knows her way of running the class is the best.

Overall I feel like she is treating her students more like highschoolers than college students because she is doing alot of things highschool teachers do to their students. College students should have the freedom to participate as much as they want in their courses.",65
crosby,4,A,BMGT444,"Nice guy, definitely knows his stuff, but god is this class boring. IMO classic case of smart professor who struggles to make class interesting. He tends to drone and ramble a lot (our final exam was delayed about 15 min because he had a story he wanted to tell). In his defense the material is pretty brutal and dense for undergrad level. 

I'm pretty sure no one knows what's going on but Professor Crosby makes the class itself relatively easy in terms of grading. I'm going to get an A but I honestly can't say I knew what the hell was going on in that class. ",69
kyle,1,,BUFN773,"""Pete"" Kyle's course is great.  A ton of reading.  You will read, you must read, and you will talk about it.  You will also write about everything you read before class.  Definitely definitely be prepared to work in this class.  Make sure you write up your material well.  You must.  That is your grade.  So, know what you are talking about from the reading and go for it.  

But you will reap the benefits from one of the greatest teaching professors using the socratic/case study method ever.  Smith is very lucky to have Professor Kyle.  Former Rhodes Scholar and just a dang good teaching professor.  

Go inside the world of hedge funds, pension funds, and get some great trivia and learn who the players are in this world.  You'll definitely know about Yale's David Swenson, Harvard's emulation, and about PIMCO. Kyle has a ton of knowledge, and he will be sharing. You must talk in this class, so do your reading.  There is often no right answer.  It's a critical thinking exercise, all perspectives are fair game. This is a great class.

He has a TA grade most of the write-ups, so write to that.  I would pepper a lot of the writing with Econ lingo to give it the edge since I knew a finance focused TA would be reading them.  If I polished my papers a bit more and didn't wait til the last second each lecture, could have done a lil better.  Still did well.  Enjoy.

lazar_radu,5,B,BMGT230B,"I am TOTALLY not a math person, but I actually really enjoyed this course. Radu is funny and chill, and he seems to care about his students. His accent is also fun to listen to, and in no way impedes his ability to teach. The lectures go fast (we usually take notes and do a few practice problems), and then discussion is really helpful if you need any extra review. There's a quiz once a week in discussion (out of 5 points, usually pretty easy), one homework assignment, and one pre-lecture quiz. This means that you have to learn the info beforehand and take a quiz on it, all before he lectures. This sounds waaaaay worse than it, and most people get 100s on them. Don't leave class early, but other than that Radu is really laid back. I highly recommend this course! When I took stats in high school, I hated it because my teacher made it way harder than it needed to be. Radu breaks it down in the simplest way. Find someone to teach you the calculator tricks if you don't already know them, it'll save you a ton of time and effort!",75
lazar_radu,4,,BMGT230,"As long as your do all your homework, and I mean doing them without using the show answer feature, you should be fine. He's not the best professor in the world, but his expectations are very reasonable. People only complain about this class because they expect an easy A without having to go to class or do the homework. ",75
lazar_radu,4,,BMGT230,"Lazar is a funny guy, but he can definitely be intimidating if you are lost or don't want to follow his rules. (For example, NEVER walk out of lecture early. He will yell at you for being rude). Otherwise, he explains he is just talking loudly and normally tries to make a lot of jokes. I was fortunate enough to have taken AP Statistics in high school so none of the material was new to me. If you can, find a prior AP-stat student who can teach you all the calculator tricks that will practically do the problems for you. It saves a ton of time. He allows you to make exam cheat sheets so take advantage of that! The weekly quizzes are all multiple choice and pretty easy. Try to keep up because by mid-semester all the material will start building on itself. He provides practice exams and the TAs tend to be very helpful at explaining concepts. If you have taken AP Stats before this class should not be difficult at all, but I do really feel for those who do not have this background. Study and practice and it should be okay!",75
lazar_radu,4,B,BMGT230B,"Professor Lazar gets a bad wrap, but it is honestly not his fault. It is more the class that is less interesting than him.  Professor Lazar may seem to some to be forceful and mean, which he can be if you act disrespectfully (leaving class early, talking, being on your phone), but overall he wants to make a large lecture style class more engaging for students. He has started letting TA's write on the board, and our TA Katherine Feng was superb, and was a wealth of knowledge if you didn't understand something.  Lazar, is not mean, and he is very effective in helping students understand the content. The only thing I did not like him for is when you ask questions he often is like ""well thats not really correct"" when it is usually almost exactly correct, but not the way he would want you to say it.  So to summarize the class is hard and you have to put in A LOT of work to get an A, but he does what he can to help you learn the concepts and he will curve the test average to about a 75 which can be nice.  ",75
lazar_radu,1,B+,BMGT230,"This is possibly the worst teacher I have ever had. He's horrible at explaining simple questions and the whole lecture is confusing. The only was I survived was going to my TA every week. When I went to him for help and asked about concepts he yelled and said ""I don't know why so many students come here asking that, if you don't get it then you don't"". If everyone asks you haven't explained it right -__-.Take this at your local community college over the summer.",75
lazar_radu,4,C+,BMGT230,"I was scared heading into this class especially after never taking a statistics class before. Radu a good professor but I see why some students don't like him. He can be intimidating to the point where you don't want to ask questions in class. I will say that he does go over examples a lot and you will know if an idea is important. 

As the other reviews say, he does want you to do well in his class. The tests are challenging but he curves. DO NOT SLEEP on the first test. It's supposed to be the easiest but questions can be tricky and it will be curved the least if at all. The second test is the hardest. I did the best on the final with a B.

1)Attend lectures and SIT CLOSE. His handwriting can be hard to read. 

2)ATTEND DISCUSSIONS. These are easy points and the questions can help understand concepts. 

3) Make a GREAT Exam sheet for the tests. My cheat sheets for the first two exams were unorganized and I paid for it. For the final I made one organized with the formulas and it helped. 

Study, practice and you should be fine. ",75
lazar_radu,5,A+,BMGT230,"I know a lot of my friends have struggled in this class, but if you take the time and effort to do lots of practice problems on your own, you should be able to do well on the exams. I have never taken stat before and I did well. Lazar cares so much about his students and he is so sweet and supportive towards his students and he truly wants you to do well. Radu does have an accent, but he is not difficult to understand. 

Exams: First exam is not curved, my second exam was curved 16%, and the final was curved 11%. Overall, the exams are pretty much like the practice exam that he sends out a week before the exam.

Discussion: Go to discussion! My TA was super helpful and she held review sessions all the time before exams and was willing to answer all questions.  Be sure to go on time, otherwise you lose points.

Class: Go to class, because while he vaguely follows the slides, he adds a lot of additional information and his work on the whiteboards helps a lot with understanding the problems. ",75
lazar_radu,5,A,BMGT230,"Overall: A lot of students in this class find it to be very difficult, but one of the biggest things you can do to help your grade is by doing problems on your own and making sure you understand how to use your cheat sheet. A lot of students do not do well, because they think that if they just have the formulas and definitions than they will be fine. My key for anyone taking this class is to do a lot of problems outside of class. I skimmed the book and barely went to class after the first couple of weeks; the only reason I received an A was by doing a lot of practice outside of class.

Curves: His curves are so generous for this class. He did not curve the first exam for my class, but he curved the second exam by 16% and then curved the final exam by 14%. On top of that he curved the class as a whole so that the cutoff between a B+ and an A- was an 88%.

Final thoughts: Just do a lot of practice in preparation for exams and make sure you really understand how to find the answer on the practice exams he gives you. These exams are a big help, but you still have to understand the concepts to do well. The way he teaches in class is more for understanding the concept, but you have to do work outside of class in order to really understand how to apply the concepts.",75
lazar_radu,5,,BMGT230,"1. He really wants you to do well in his class. Don't take the negative reviews too seriously - it's a difficult course, but he explains the concepts thoroughly and he reviews every lesson at least 3x. 

2. If you didn't take stat in high school, be prepared to study. a lot. a lot a lot. This is a fast-paced course with a lot of material - he has to go over the lessons pretty quickly. Know your fundamentals - the course builds on itself. You'll see, it actually gets easier toward the end. 

3. He has really nice arms and a nice tapered back. wuow. ",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230B,"I took stats in high school. It's pretty much the same thing, except all multiple choice. There are two midterms and a final, not cumulative. He genuinely wants you to do well. He does get upset if you get a question wrong in class or in office hours, but it's mostly just his tone. He teaches extensively in class and gives good examples, so go to class. Discussions apply concepts taught during the week. You can have a formula sheet for theoretical notions, no assumptions, so there's no memorization. You just need to know when to apply a certain formula/concept. This is a weed out class, so it is hard. I did poorly on the first exam because I thought knowing the math was enough. It is not. You have to be very careful because his true/false questions are pretty hard. Do the practice tests and take note of the questions you get wrong. The first exam is easiest and got no curve. The second got 16%, and I assume the final will be curved by a little less. That's what he implied.",75
lazar_radu,1,,BMGT230,"This is a difficult class and Lazar is not a good professor. His accent is difficult to understand, he screams when he lectures, and faces the board half the time. He writes very fast and has terrible handwriting, which is frustrating to read. 

He teaches way to fast, and much of his style is just throwing formulas, without explaining anything conceptually. He doesn't go over examples, and to learn the concepts you have to go to your TA or learn it yourself. ",75
lazar_radu,3,A,BMGT230,"He teaches extremely fast and I almost never understood anything (chapter 6-7+) after his lectures. You have to supplement his lectures with your own studying. Your TA is a very good resource. The discussions are key to helping you understand everything. Just by listening to Lazar's lectures I understood maybe 15-25% of the material, then 30%-50% from the homework/textbook and the rest was due to a good TA who taught in a much more straightforward step by step fashion.
In all honesty, past chapter 9, everything is essentially the same, and you have to recognize that in order to o well. For example, you will have to do Z-test/T-Test/CI and do it for a variety of situations, the rules are just slightly different. Somethings I wish were different was that he would post answers to his review slides and make his lecture slides more reader friendly as if you didn't attend class. Do not let yourself fall behind, I skipped a week of classes and I had to study twice as much to get an A on the final exam. 

As for curves:
1st Exam: No Curve
2nd Exam: 12-14% (forgot)
3rd Exam; 125
End of Semester ""curve"": 88% = A- ",75
lazar_radu,3,,BMGT230,"After having just taken the final today, here are my thoughts:

1) It's such a cop out when everyone blames Radu for this class being so hard. He's a good guy who makes it clear that he wants students to do well. The only reason why he may appear to be condescending and cynical is because he knows the material is hard and expects students to work hard at getting the concepts down. He seems tough because he blows through lecture material at 100 mph, but that's only because the business school designed the course to be a weed out class, and so it was designed to pack an absurdly large amount of difficult material into one semester. Also, all of the complaints about his accent and handwriting are bullshit. You can understand his voice just fine and if you don't sit in the very back row of the lecture hall then you can clearly understand his handwriting. 

2) There's no getting around it: this class is hard. Like some other reviewers have said, statistics is unlike any other field of study. Half of it is really tedious math formulas and the other half of it is inference and vague concepts. The material is even more difficult if you don't read the book and skip lecture. Each chapter also usually builds on the previous one, so don't fall behind otherwise you'll sorely regret it come exam time.

Some people get stat and some people don't. It was easily one of the hardest classes I've taken during my three years as a terp so far. College is hard as hell in general though.
",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230,"Lazar continually mentions that this class is a weed out class, and taking the course, I now know why. This class will be a nightmare if you do not put your effort into it. It is very difficult, however, I actually found it very interesting (I guess I'm in the minority). And please, it really is quite doable. I did not take Stat before yet I have an A right now. 

It is true that he really does go fast during his lectures but it REALLY helps if you have the powerpoint slides with you during the lecture. 

Also, NEVER LET YOURSELF GET BEHIND IN CLASS. Keep your phones in your backpack for just one hour because a couple seconds of not paying attention could cost you a lot!

He is not a mean guy really. He comes off as a bit loud and judgmental (he's not though) but he really wants his students to do well. He knows this stuff by heart. ",75
lazar_radu,1,C,BMGT230,One of the hardest classes if not the hardest class I took in college. Only reason I took this class was because it's a requirement for business majors and he's the only teacher for the course.,75
lazar_radu,4,A+,BMGT230,"PLEASE: Read these reviews as a student, meaning someone who is going to school for the purpose of learning and gaining new knowledge. If your idea of being a student does not include the will to learn, you will find this class difficult.

The concepts are not difficult if you put your cell phone down for an hour, pay attention in class, and go to most of the discussions. His slides are great, although he doesn't usually follow them. Take the initiative to have them in front of you so that you have what's relevant in front of you at all times while he's writing on the board.

Homework is pretty simple. You get a couple of tries, there are identical problems to practice (with different data sets) if you're really struggling with a concept.

Practice exams are a GREAT tool to use to study. As mentioned by others, curving is usually very generous. I took this Spring 2012: 

The first exam had a class average of B+ without any curve, so it wasn't curved in the end.

The second exam was curved 13%, the third was about 10%. After these curves, FINAL GRADES were then curved once again. So, if after all the exams and their included curves, you have an 88%, you would get an A.

This class is pretty much laid out for you in terms of what you need to know. There are NO surprises. There are TONS of opportunities for ""extra credit"" via Lazar's heavy curving policies.

If you can't squeeze out a B in this class, something is wrong with your focus. 

YOU GET A CHEAT SHEET, front and back of a printer paper, that you can write almost anything on -- if this isn't enough, I don't know what is.

Professor Lazar is a smart, funny guy who WILL call you out in front of lectures of 300+ if you claim that 2 squared is 6, or if you ask a question when the answer to it was on the previous slide that was up for 5 minutes.

Come to class to learn, not to sit there and listen half-heartedly while you're on your phone. Don't come if you're going to leave early. Sit closer to the front because everything is written on the dry erase boards.

If you go to lecture and discussion, spend an hour or two a WEEK on the homework, and start studying the practice exam a week or so ahead of the exam itself, you'll be fine.",75
lazar_radu,3,C-,BMGT230,"Radu is not a good or bad teacher, however be aware that the curves can save you. I got Ds on two tests and failed the final, but I was still able to pass the class(just barely)because I went to all the discussions and got the points there, while doing well on the online homework. You can tell it is a weed out class so be prepared. ",75
lazar_radu,2,B,BMGT230,"This class is doable, but definitely a huge pain, unnecessarily.

Radu's accent isn't what bothers me. It's his handwriting. He scribbles complicated formulas on the board and speeds up his talking speed 3x whenever he's writing a formula, and unless you sit in the first two rows good luck getting it down. Between that and his 500 rhetorical questions during lecture, prepare to be completely disengaged from the lecture. His condescending tone when no one has the guts to answer makes him totally unapproachable. 

Homeworks can be a *****, depending on your skill level with the online tools, and the textbook style is really annoying and gives you a ton of info you don't need to know. 

At the end of the day, I don't care how much of a master of statistics this guy is. If you're teaching business students who 99% won't go a step further in the field of stats I don't see why there isn't a more relatable professor. 

the only way I eked out a B was through the help of a beastly TA who gave a review the night before and actually controlled the attention of a packed lecture hall.

It's no wonder that when I met with Radu after adding the class a week into the semester, he said ""you cannot avoid me unless you take this class in the summer""",75
lazar_radu,5,A-,BMGT230,"Radu is the man. I don't understand all the hate he gets. I think his accent is awesome, it reminds me of Borat.

He truly wants you to do well, he says this all the time before an exam. He knows the material extremely well - and I think he conveys it pretty clearly. Everyone that complains about his handwriting should sit closer to the front.. it's definitely not neat, but you can read it.

Truly try to understand the material. I got a 66 on the first exam somehow and was feeling low, but that motivated me to do better. Second exam I got a 81 with the curve. At this point I'm sitting at a C. The final is easier than the second exam and you should do your best to ace it. I got a 90 without the curve (102 with the curve) and received an A- in the class. Did I mention that he curves it so that an 88 is an A?

Study the practice exams that Dr. Lazar gives out! They are very similar to the exams! I studied the practice final until I knew it like the back of my hand. That is how I got an A in the class. 

Dr. Lazar does not deserve all the hate he deserves. Come to class and pay attention, and if you don't understand something, go ask him. He may seem intimidating but he honestly wants you to succeed.
",75
lazar_radu,3,A-,BMGT230,"I finished the year with an 88.02 and everything above an 88 was an A, so I got lucky. Overall the course was pretty difficult. This was my first time taking stat. Make sure you go to all the discussion so you get a 100% on 10% of your grade. Same principle applies to homework. If you follow the examples that are provided, a 100% is not out of reach. The rest of the 80% of the grade is determined by exams. Make sure your cheat sheet is good, and practice as many problems as you can before the test. The first test is not curved at all, but the second two tests are curved about 12 points each. Radu is a good guy, but sometimes his teaching style is confusing. I went to most of the classes and took good notes, but found myself more helped by just doing the homework. Overall if you spend about 8 hours in total studying for each test and make sure that you get a very high grade in homework and discussion, an A is reasonable. ",75
lazar_radu,4,B,BMGT230,"Something you need to keep in mind before taking this class: Statistics as a field is unlike anything a normal student will have encountered in high school before taking it in college. The rules and ways of thinking that apply for math and other sciences are not the same that you need to develop for statistics. So don't think you'll be able to ace the class because you're a math whiz (although that would probably help.)

The second thing you need to know is that this class is a gateway course for the Smith School of Business. What does that mean? It means that this class is inherently difficult to weed out the kids who don't want to work as hard or aren't as good students. There are reasons that not everyone gets into the business school. This class is one of them.

The third thing you need to know is that this class is entirely what you make of it. If you put in the time to go to class, listen to Radu, take notes, go home, review your notes once or twice a week, do the homework, study for the tests (ACTUALLY study), you'll be fine. You need to put a lot of effort to get that A, but the curves should help you.

That being said, I would rate Radu as an above-average teacher. He's definitely not the best I've had, but he's absolutely not the worst. Almost all of the complains that have been posted here are problems with the class itself, not with Radu's teaching style. HIS ACCENT DOES NOT GET IN THE WAY OF HIS TEACHING AT ALL. If you think his accent is hard to understand you need to wake the fuck up, get your head out of your ass and welcome yourself to the real world, because in real life there are people who are a lot harder to understand than him. 

Radu does teach quickly, but again, this class is hard and there's a lot to cover. His handwriting isn't the best but he'll always clarify what he wrote or any question if you just have the balls to ask it in front of a lecture of 150 people. Sit close and you can read everything. The power-points are hit-or-miss in terms of helpfulness.

If you don't understand something, though, Radu will always meet with you during office hours and is pretty good at explaining things one-on-one. YOU need to take the initiative and go ask him, though. If you resign yourself to failing in this class that's exactly what will happen.

A new calculator will not help you at all. The math in this class is pretty basic-it's the concepts that are hard. The book is not really helpful, and is most of the time more confusing than the way Radu teaches it. 

Ask yourself honestly if you're willing to put the time and effort into taking the class, because the majority of you reading this don't have a choice. It's really not that bad, but your only alternative is taking it at community college. The rest of you shut the fuck up about hating on Radu and just accept that your lazy, retarded asses didn't try hard enough to get a good grade and move on with your life. Sheesh.",75
lazar_radu,4,A+,BMGT230,"I really don't know why people ride Radu so hard. Yeah, he has an accent, but it's not a detriment to his teaching. He goes fast, but that's because there is such a large breadth of material to cover. Plus his curves are absolutely ridiculous, which overrides the difficulty of the material somewhat. Tips to do well:

1.) Come to class. You don't have to show up all the time, but at least once a week, just to keep up with the material that he emphasizes. 

2.) Do the homework. You can use the View an Example tool, but don't rely on it to get the answer. It can help you understand the process for sure.

3.) Make a kick-ass cheat-sheet. Seriously, this is all I really did to study for the exams, and there's plenty of room to really have everything you need.

4.) Do well on the first exam. He didn't curve it at all. I got 100 on it, and it gave me some nice cushion. Second exam is the hardest, but he also curved it by 18% this semester, and he curved the final by 14%. Additionally, 88% and above got an A I think, so the curves really help, so much that I actually ended up with over a 100% in the entire class. 

The class is doable, if you pay attention when you do go to class, really try to the understand the material, and make a good cheat sheet. Good luck!

You can buy a TI-84 calculator if you want, it can come in handy in a pinch. 
",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230,"Professor Lazar is hilarious, and a VERY nice guy. He was very understanding of my situation, (I'm a commuting student who worked two jobs this past semester), and switched me to a different discussion mid-semester because of a work conflict.

I'd recommend this class to anyone because of the curving. I'm just terrible at math as it is, and was not trying to get into the business school. I wanted to ""challenge"" myself by not taking elementary statistics- and I'd call that a big mistake, if not for the curving Prof. Lazar did. The required avg. GPA for the class is 2.7-2.9, so grade curves are adjusted based on that. 

Learn how to use a TI-83 or 84, because it'll save a LOT of time. Do all the homework, too, and never miss discussion, and you'll be golden.",75
lazar_radu,2,C,BMGT230,This was arguably the hardest class I have ever taken in my life.  Radu didn't really connect with the students that well so it was hard to follow his lectures.  His writing was incredibly sloppy so it was another reason that it was more challenging.  The only positive thing I can say is that his curves were incredibly lenient.,75
lazar_radu,2,C,BMGT230,"Overall I thought radu was good at presenting the material, after each class you kinda get a idea of what he's talking about. hw and discussion are meant to boost your grade so make sure that you complete all those. The only problem I had with this class are the exams i thought they were extremely challenging. I studied hard for every test and pretty much knew all the concepts and barely passed every exam. the important thing is to not fall benhind in this class. even though radu curves like crazy, if you have no idea what your doing you will fail. The exams consitute pretty much your entire grade so try not to fail too bad.

Studying from mymathlab seldomly works. study the worksheets from discussion and review questions he gives on slides this is why going to lecture is imnportant he gives you answers to the review questions. The most important thing to study are the past exams that he gives you that's the only thing i felt helped. The problem with this class was that I felt as if i was never prepared for the exams no matter how much i studied.",75
lazar_radu,2,C,BMGT230,"This class sucks so much. Professor Lazar has good intentions and trys his hardest to help you understand. But the fact of the matter is that you can barely read what he writes on the board and you won't understand any concepts he explains in class.
He goes off of his power points which are long and full of information which is impossible to write all down. He tries to put up the equations on the board, but he never explains what certain variables and symbols really mean. If you have to solve one variable to put into a second or even third equation for an answer, you have no idea how to find or compute the first variable. He also never gives examples to problem sets. He just shows you an equation and moves on. Extremely confusing class, and his tests and just as bad. I do not recommend taking this class to anyone who doesn't have to. Its boring, and might be the hardest class i've ever taken throughout my whole time in school. ",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230,"

First of all, this class is horribly dry and boring. That being said, Prof. Lazar MAKES THE BEST OF IT!! There is only so much you can do to make business statistics exciting and engaging. He has a lot of material to cover in a really short period of time, so class seems like it is constantly rushed. Which is pretty much is. Also, his accent is not that bad. People on this site are just whining because they didn't put the effort in and they didn't get good grades. Seriously, I don't feel bad at all because it's not impossible to get an A or B in this class! ***NOT TO MENTION HE CURVES AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT***

I am not one to cut corners when it comes to studying because I actually want to make something of my $32,000 a year education, so I put in my fair share of work and I will definitely get an A in this class (WITHOUT the curve) and I've never seen stat before this class in my life. ***IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET AN A IN THIS CLASS WITHOUT THE CURVE IF YOU DO THE WORK****

My advice:

1. Attend lecture. He sometimes gives out helpful hints about what to expect on the exams, and he always does extra examples on the board -- MANY of which are similar to exam questions.

2. Do the homework, and try not to use ""show an example."" It sucks, but think of the extra hour or two on stat as time put forth towards studying for the exam. Because that time will add up, and it'll be 20 hours you already put into trying to learn it over the course of the semester rather than the night before. Easy solution. 

3. I know a kid who never went to class, (took AP stat though in high school), knew how to use his calculator, and passed every exam with an A - no curve. So... I guess if you've taken it before in high school, you won't have to work as hard as the other students who've never seen stat in their lives. Good news for those kids.

4. Read the chapters before class! They are usually pretty short and they make his lecture soooooooooo much easier to follow.

5. Study using your cheat sheet so you know where to find the information quickly on the exam. 

6. I used a basic scientific calculator on every exam. You'll probably spend more time learning how to use a TI-84 (if you're not familiar with it) than learning how to do the material by hand.... which isn't that much. I can't help but laugh at people who seriously think a TI-84 will help them pass this class when over half of the exam is testing concepts and understanding, not hard math.

I never once used a TI-83 or TI-84 in this class and I got an A without the curve. Seriously, this class is doable. Also, he makes corny jokes in class and they're actually kind of entertaining so it isn't so bad.

Again, people who complain about it are just admitting they're lazy students! THIS IS A REQUIRED COURSE FOR THE BUSINESS SCHOOL, SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH AND BE PREPARED TO WORK HARD! 

The book is super helpful, his accent has nothing to do with people failing this course, the class is terribly boring, but it's NOT impossible! ",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230,"First thing you need to do: Buy a TI-84 Calculator.

Just in case that wasn't big enough for you to see...

BUY A TI-84 CALCULATOR!!!

Your grades in this class will be directly correlated to how well you can use the TI-84 to do the problems on the tests. If you do not know how to use the calculator, take the time to search for tutorials online or ask a friend who knew how to teach you. I wish I was kidding about how much you will need the calculator for the tests but I'm completely serious. 

Now that the most vital piece of information is noted, let's move on to the structure of the class. The lectures will start with some very easy statistic stuff in the beginning but the difficulty will ramp up steeply after the drop date is over, no coincidence there. Try not to miss the lectures even if you are bored in the class, missing one will put you behind significantly. Learning stuff from the lectures the first time will be difficult so make sure to do practice problems from the book to understand the concepts right away. 

Discussion sections are NOT optional. You need to go to all of them. Although he will give you 2 free days, I recommend saving them up for when you REALLY need to skip them. You're going to need every points you can get. Same goes for homeworks, he will drop the lowest 2. The thing with homeworks is that you do them online and can view similar problems that basically tells you how to do the problem. So there's no reason you should get anything other than at least 90% in every single homework. 

Now we come to the most important part of the class, the exams. I will tell you now that the exams are VERY HARD. He will give out a sample exam before the exam and I highly recommend you understand everything in the sample exam. If you do not understand some questions, DO NOT put them off. Try to learn how to solve them as soon as possible. This is where the TI-84 will be your savior. If you try to do problems manually from the way he teach, you will waste a lot of time and prone to making errors. The TI-84 is designed to solve those problems, USE IT! The good news is that he curves the exam and it should help out with your grades a lot. 

If you didn't bother to read my review, here's the shortened version:

BUY A TI-84 AND LEARN HOW TO USE IT!!!",75
lazar_radu,2,,BMGT230,"I'll make it short and simple with a full list of pros and cons. I hate to sound like a snobby *$#!, but I'm a pretty smart guy who currently has nearly a 100% in the class, and this is just how I see things:

PROS:
-Knows his material
-Homework helps a lot
-Tests are unimaginably simple
-My TA was pretty good, idk about the others
-Actively uses boards and powerpoints at the same time
-Open to questions, help, convenience, etc.

Cons: This will be a long list.
-Strong accent to get used to
-Absolutely horrid handwriting. He writes small, slanted, crooked, even when paying attention it's hard to concentrate.
-Stat Crunch is useful if you know how to use it. Plenty of people go through the class without knowing how to use it at all, and as a consequence, they don't do well. He needs to teach you how to use this instead of rushing through it in class and not showing you how things work.
-Knows material a bit too well, sometimes what he says doesn't make sense at all. I can read the book for 5 minutes and understand more than what's taught in 35 minutes of the lecture.
-Homework is online and has many glitches. You could end up losing points on bad rounding, missing symbols, or things that shouldn't give you no credit for. 

And finally:
This class doesn't help much at all. Since he allows us to use one page cheat sheets (two page for final) front and back, I can make a very elaborate cheat sheet, give it to a 5th grader, and that 5th grader could probably get an A or B. At the end of this course, most people won't walk out with much knowledge of statistics. They'll know a few things, but they'll learn them [b]using stat-crunch or technology, things we can't use in the real world without looking like an inexperienced college student.[/b]

Though sometimes tests focus too much on small things. Half of one of the midterms focused on something we spent 2 classes on. The other half is something we spent almost 10 classes on. ",75
lazar_radu,4,C,BMGT230B,"He's not a bad teacher, Radu curves things like crazy.  It's mainly on the student to learn the material though since he cannot take too much time to cover it in class.  There's a lot to learn, so he flies during class.  -There's nothing he can do about it.-  

Word of advise, DO NOT GET BEHIND ON READING.  I failed the first midterm with a 53% thinking I would be good with my reference sheet.  WRONG.  I had no idea how to use the formulas.  AP stat is nothing like this, you can get an understanding of the material from prior stat classes, but do not understand it to the degree he tests you on.  

Read the book daily.  He is not kidding when he tells you to study at least 5 hours a week.  Just read the book, take notes, and do the mystatlab homeworks and a few practice problems and you'll be good.  

Be prepared to work.  Learn how to use your calculator for all of your T-test, and interval tests, it's your best friend.  ",75
lazar_radu,1,C,BMGT230,"Radu is not only a terrible professor but also a terrible person. He breezes through material in class, and though most people blame his thick accent, it is his indifference to his students success that makes people hate him. I went to his office hours countless times and he became offensive about my character and commitment to success. The TA's were terrible. Mine did not add any sort of help whatsoever. AVOID HIM TAKE THIS CLASS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE/ELSEWHERE HE SUCKS. ",75
lazar_radu,4,A-,BMGT230,"Most people complain about this guy, though he is really not that bad. Sure he has an accent, but he knows what hes talking about. Hes definitely not the best professor but certainly not the worst. Actually, he's really generous when it comes to grades. Like people before me said, make sure to do well on the first test, it can carry you the rest of the semester. I got a 100 with the curve on the first test and 60s without the curve on the second test and final and managed to come out of the class with an A-, so really anyone can do it. The class is hard, just read the book, know how to use your calculator and write everything on the reference sheets!",75
lazar_radu,1,C+,BMGT230B,"I hated this class.
Honestly the WORST class I've taken at Maryland, and that is saying a lot.

His notes in lecture are so sloppy you feel like you're looking at a 2 year old's writing
The exams are so hard. Actually, they are extremely hard - and that is because he bases them off whatever is running through his mind at the time. They do not relate to the homework, and do not relate to the discussions either. 

I never took statistics prior to coming to this class, but was told that its not that bad of a class - that was until I got Radu.

His accent isn't bad, you can understand him well, that's not the problem.
It's just his tests.
Even the cheat sheets that he allows does not really help because yes we can have formula's on there, but the way he writes his questions makes it hard for us to know when to use the formula's.

I went to every class, BUT fell asleep 8 out of 10 times.

Glad I never have to take statistics again *wipes head*",75
lazar_radu,4,A-,BMGT230,"One of the big themes you may have realized by reading other people’s reviews is that Radu frequently complains how all of his students think he’s bad/horrible at teaching. In my opinion, he’s definitely not the best professor at teaching, but he’s certainly not the worst. To his credit, Stat is a difficult course to teach and learn, because Stat is ALL formulas and numbers, so unless students devote some attention to the class, there’s no way to do well. However, because students often don’t give a lot of attention to classes, students typically do badly, and then start blaming the professor for their performance. Also, I think a huge thing that contributed to people’s bad review about him first semester was that he didn’t give practice exams because it was his first semester teaching at UMD. In my semester though, he gave our class first semester’s exams, giving us a good idea of what the exams will be on. Having never taken Stat before in my life though and getting an A (and I’m not good at math or anything), I can personally say that Radu is not bad. 

One thing Radu is REALLY good at is CURVES. He curves A LOT. My semester, he curved the first exam by 3/35 points (~9%), the second exam by 3/25 points (12%), and the final exam by 3/30 points (10%). On top of that, he even curved the entire class, making an A anything above 87% in the class, a B from 78-87%, a C from 64-78%, a D from 48-64%, and an F below 48%. With this much curve, he certainly eliminates any wrongdoing on his part in my opinion. I certainly don’t think that he’s so bad that even with his curves it’s still his fault of doing bad. He actually really does respect his students performance and cares about how well his students do.

In terms of what you’ll be doing during the semester, the three things that make up your grade are homework, discussion, and the exams. Homework is due every week, with 11 assignments in total (the lowest two are dropped). The homework can take anywhere between 30 minutes for easy ones and 90 minutes for hard ones, average is about an hour. The homework is REALLY easy to get a 100% on by looking at examples, therefore you should automatically get 10% of your grade. Discussion is also really easy to get 100%, but it is mandatory. You’re two lowest grades are dropped (so you’re able to not go twice), but after that you’ll start losing points. So as long as you go every time, you’ll get another 10% of your grade. That leaves the rest of your 80% of your grade to exams. Since there were a total of 90 questions between all 3 exams and the exams are worth 80% of your grade, each question on an exam is worth slightly less than 1% of your total grade. By doing the math, that means the class is ultimately curved by about 11% (8.137% from exams and about ~3% by lowering the grade requirements). 

To do well in this class, I HIGHLY recommend you follow these tips: 

1. DON’T EVEN TRY TO LEARN STAT THE WAY HE TEACHES IT. BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LEARN IN THIS CLASS IS HOW TO USE A CALCULATOR TO DO ALL THE THINGS HE TEACHES. I cannot stress how important this is. You need at least a TI-84 to do everything he teaches, I bought a TI-Nspire though which was really helpful. What calculator you have is critical. If you only have a TI-83, BUY a new calculator. As a matter of fact, I would definitely say that you should buy a new calculator before you buy the textbook. If you want to try and learn stat the way I did (by just learning how to use a calculator) then you won’t need the textbook at all. However, the code to get access to the homework comes with the textbook, so sometimes it’s worth it to get the textbook too. To be able to learn how to use a calculator though, it is really helpful to have someone you know who took AP Stat and can help you with how to use a calculator. It would be REALLY difficult to teach yourself how to use a calculator without someone helping you. Even more difficult would be teaching yourself stat the way Radu has to teach it (obviously he can’t just teach students how to use a calculator). I don’t think I would’ve had ANY chance at all getting an A by learning stat the academic way (by using formulas and stuff), I would've probably actually gotten a C. 

2. Make sure to do well on the first exam. This exam will require the least amount of calculations and is mostly conceptual (making it the easiest exam for most people). Because it’s the easiest exam, Radu curves it the least. That’s why it’s important to not screw up. 

3. Even if you want to teach yourself by just using a calculator, you should still sometimes go to class. For some reason, it definitely helps to go to class. You certainly don’t need to go to every class (unless you want to learn stat the way Radu teaches it) but you should at LEAST go to class 50% of the time if you’ve never taken stat before, trust me, it helps.

And just to give some other miscellaneous information, you get to have a reference sheet where you can put anything on it (front and back) for the first two exams and for the final you get to have 2 reference sheets. Also, you get to write your answers down on those reference sheets while taking the exam and then he emails the exam answers an hour after the end of the exam so you can instantly see how you did on the exam. He uploads all the powerpoints during lecture in class too. 
",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230,"He is a good guy but the class is very hard. He does make a good amount of effort to teach the material to his students, though. You really just have to go to class and read the book constantly to get a good grade, but if you do not have time because of other hard classes, you may fall behind like I did",75
lazar_radu,5,A+,BMGT230,"This guy is an incredible business statistics professor. The guy knows his stuff by heart and can spell everything out for you on the board, which he does daily in class. He's got a romanian accent so he can sound like he's yelling sometimes but as he says on the first day of class and many days after, he's not yelling its just his accent. Another thing that he says many times over is that this class takes effort and honestly he's right because this is probably the hardest of the business school prerequisites to master and understand. He posts all of his lectures online on ELMS before the class so definitely print those out and bring them to class, it's so much easier than trying to write it all down and it's how I earned my A.
Tips to pass:
1. Do all of the homework even though he drops the lowest 2, you'll understand the material much better
2. Come to every class and pay attention. Like I said the man knows his stuff and if you want to do well, he's the guy to pay attention to.
3. Make good reference sheets for the exam! These are very important since he lets you use sheets front and back for the tests. I made me reference sheets out of the review sessions that he did before each exam and earned As on every test. They make the difference
4. Most importantly, do the practice/old exams! These pretty closely resemble the current tests and help show what you need to know greatly! Make your reference sheet first and then use it to take the practice finals and to do practice problems. It's not cheating or not helping you study since you are going to use that sheet when taking the test anyway!

Overall, this guy is great and since you gotta take the class to get into the business school, you might as well take it with someone who cares and writes out everything you need to know. Be prepared to work hard and don't fall behind. Good luck!",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230,"People need to relax with all the bad reviews about this guy. Dr. Lazar is a really chill teacher who really wants to help his students out in this class. Business statistics is really boring and can be a lot of material at times, but it's not all that bad.

The two midterms are difficult compared to other classes, but there were 8%-12% curves. There's weekly homework which is a really good way to review and make sure you understand what's going on.

Be ready to work when taking this class.",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230,"The work I put in this class is average compared to other students, but I end up getting high As in both midterms and the final, I think this is because I went to 98% of his lectures. You can't just think oh his accent is horrible so I'll skip class and teach yourself the materials later. Unless you are a super genius, it is very very hard to self-teach Stat especially after the first midterm, the long formulas in later chapters are throw you off. 
Yes his lectures are dry, and I didn't quite understand any concepts during lectures, I kinda just blindly copied down his PowerPoint and his side notes, but these notes help A LOT for me to refer back when I do homework. 

Tips for this class:
1. Go to as many lectures as possible and write down not only the slides but also his comments on the slides (sometimes he'll say ""this type of problem will definitely be on the exam"" and it is true)
2. Try to do at least part of the homework before you go to your Friday discussion so you don't feel like an idiot staring blankly at the practice quiz
3. Make sure you know how to do every practice quiz because they are very similar to the problems on the actual test.
4. Make GOOD reference sheet for the test. It's the worst feeling when you leave some formulas out and then you find yourself in desperate need of those formulas for a bunch of problems on the test. 

The class isn't that bad. People really complain too much. I think Professor Lazar is fine, he IS trying his best to teach, so give him a break and use that energy to find out what you wrong.
",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230B,"Radu is a really nice guy and is sincerely interested in his students but he is just not a very good teacher.  I do almost everything I can do to do well in the class but the way the homework and presentations are given there just doesn't seem to be a way to study efficiently.  When you do the homework try not to use stat crunch or the examples because you will have neither of these on the exam. Try not to study from mymathlab and use the ta's office hours instead of radu's because he will just talk to you about all the terrible reviews he's gotten online.  If you must take this class then go into it knowing that you will have to work extremely hard just to gain a basic understanding of the material. Good luck, you'll need it.",75
lazar_radu,4,A,BMGT230B,"1) I have never taken Statistics before.
2) I went to 70% of the lectures.

He's new, and really does care about his students. STAT overall as a subject is dry, but the discussion problems and annoying homeworks really ARE related to the exam. I have fallen asleep.

He moves FAST in lecture, yes. But there is too much material to cover. If you manage to keep up, it turns out he makes a lot of sense. So pre-read AND post-read and review his informative slides!

The Honors version of STAT gives out much, much more work. 

Tips to pass:
1) COMPLETE HW without ""viewing example"" or notes. If you can do that, you're set. Although, I almost always completed with notes. 
2) SIT IN THE FRONT. I fell asleep a couple times, and 97% of the class stares at him vacantly/on FB. Stay engaged from minute 1 and be ready when he asks for an answer. 
3) My TA was not good, but the discussion was great. Discussion, you work on problem sets in groups for points. Get someone smart/who took AP STAT in group. 
4) THE BOOK helped me close to the final. It gives a different perspective from what Lazar gives in class. 
5) Score big on the 1st exam, it gets harder after that.

Good luck!  If you do all this, with his curves you'll do fine.",75
lazar_radu,1,C,BMGT230,"Worse class I have ever taken in my entire life.  Unfortunately it is a Gateway course otherwise I would have dropped it.  Professor Lazar does not follow his lecture notes and writes sloppy notes all over the board during lecture.  He flies through material making it impossible to follow what he's writing.  You cannot write and listen at the same time because you're trying to distinguish what it is he's writing.  The second test and final are ridiculously difficult.  Yeah you're allowed reference sheets but that means nothing when you see the test.  
The only bright spot in the class is that showing up to discussion gives you points and you're allowed 2 tries on each homework problem online.  I went to Lazar himself for help at his office and he makes it seem like you're inconvieniencing him.  When I asked a question he talks to you like you're retarded and should know the answer already.  He means well but in reality he doesn't do much to simplify the material, just throws it at you and expects you to retain everything.",75
lazar_radu,2,,BMGT230,"Terrible professor. Poor lecturer so retaining hardly any information is nearly impossible. If you take this course read every chapter and go to every single class. Whatever you do DON'T STUDY FROM MY STAT LAB. RADU makes the test in a manner in which there are almost no useful ways to study because the test questions are so different from the homework and stat lab problems. 

Overall one of the worst classes I ever taken with one of the worst professors. ",75
lazar_radu,1,B,BMGT230,"Radu cares about his students, but he FAILS in all respects.
The test questions are completely different from what is assigned for homework or given in discussions. Therefore, you can study as long as you like, but since you don't have the proper resources to prepare (no study guide or recommended problems!), it is FUTILE.

In addition, the class has a focus on completing random formulas and doesn't actually enhance understanding of business statistics. It needs a major restructuring.

Lectures are an incomprehensible waste of time, so don't bother going. It won't help you out on the tests.

Advice: avoid him at all costs!!! This man doesn't know a thing about teaching and really won't help you understand statistics, which is truly an important thing to understand in the business world. 
If you are in honors, get into the honors section. 


",75
lazar_radu,3,A,BMGT230,"Lazar is not great, but he is not awful either. I found his lectures somewhat useful, once you got passed his thick accent. The course starts out very slow and simple and finishes at a rapid and difficult pace, so you have to keep up and not fall behind. His first test was very easy, but his second had an average around a 60, which he curved to an 80. He responds well when students do not too great. Homeworks once a week were repetitive and did not offer much help for his exams, which were fairly tricky. Overall, the dislike expressed toward Lazar is more of a product of BMGT230 and not him.",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230,"HARDEST CLASS I EVER TOOK! At first it seemed easy, then I realized the class covers a chapter ever week, next thing I knew we had all these equations to know which made no sense to me. The homework is not hard, but completely useless because you use stat crunch which you are not allowed to use on the exams. Luckily the class grade is curved, so even though I earned a D I will get a C. Radu goes very quickly, and you need to sit in the front row to be able to read what he writes on the board. Attendance is not mandatory which is good for those who like to skip class. ",75
lazar_radu,1,B,BMGT230,"Worse. Professor. Ever. It's so hard to pay attention to this guy with his accent. He takes a long time talking useless stuff to get to the main concept and when he does, he blazes through and expect students to understand. Everyone in the lecture  is either 1. Sleeping, 2. Have no clue what's going on, 3. Feel dumber every lecture

Oh and the homework is very annoying. You have to Stats Crunch, a very difficult tool that you have to use to calculate some answers. What's the point of using stat crunch when you can't even use it on the exam? Why bother require students to use stat crunch at all?

The only way you learn in this class is by teaching yourself. This guy is horrible at teaching. I've had enough with Business school professors.

",75
lazar_radu,5,AB,BMGT230,"Professor: Radu really knows his stuff and he's always repeating that his office hours are open. He doesn't really try to engage the students during class though. He puts powerpoints online as well as review problems for that chapter. Answers are not posted online so you do have to go to lecture to get those if you want. Somedays he'll go through the powerpoint fast and it's hard to learn that way but it's manageable. 
Course overall: I really took a liking to stats and Radu really brought that out of me. The course overall isn't that hard if you read the textbook or find some online supplementary information regarding the lesson he's covering. Stats overall is concept wise and isn't much of a equation-plug-and-chug course. 
Grades/Exams: There are 2 exams, both of which were not that hard as long as you really read the question carefully and know the concepts. If you don't know the material, it's somewhat doable as some of the questions are 'common sense'. (Ex: chances of getting an even number on a dice) He curved the second exam though because the ranges were so widely spread. Helped a lot. He also allows a 'cheat sheet' where you can post any equations or concepts on a loose-leaf paper but no example problems. Comes in handy during the tests. 
There are also online homeworks but he drops the lowest 2 grades out of either 11 or 12 assignments. (Right now we have 11 total). These online homeworks have a 'view an example' which is almost exactly like the problem you have to solve and really helps to give you guidelines as to how to solve the problem. These really helped me in studying for the exam. 
Discussions are mandatory because attendance is taken but as long as you show up on-time to 10-15 minutes late, you can get the full attendance points. TA's also give you a worksheet you get to keep and go over it in class. These worksheets helped a lot too in studying for the exams. 
Daily class life: Looked at powerpoints as he went through them during class and took notes on that specific slide. Although I recommend bringing paper and pencil as well for any graphs or tables which may be hard to type at the speed he's teaching/going.
Overall impression: I learned a lot and I know that I'll be using statistics later on in my academic career. Radu really knew his material and I'm glad I took it with him. To me, this is one of those work decently hard classes and get an A. Fall behind a little bit, 1-3 chapters, and you could still manage a B, granted you catch up before the exam.",75
lazar_radu,3,C,BMGT230,"statistics in general was very hard for me to understand at first, especially because of the wide variety of notation. Radu moves fairly quickly through his powerpoints. several times i had to go online to check what i hadnt had time to write down. BMGT230 took alot of work but he curved both the second midterm, which most of the class bombed, and the final grade. he wants you to do well, but the subject is very tough",75
lazar_radu,4,A-,BMGT230,"An online homework is assigned each week for 10% of final grade, it's difficult to score under a 90%.  Just showing up to discussion every week is worth 10%, and he allows you to miss 2 without a reduction of the grade.  2 Midterms account for 23% each, and a final for 34%.  Radu allows students a double sided 8.5x11"" reference sheet for each exam, and 2 for the final.  Overall, with decent amount of input and good work ethic, an A shouldn't be out of reach.",75
lazar_radu,5,A-,BMGT430,Radu is a good guy. If you attend lectures and pay attention you will learn a lot in his classes. This course is not particularly easy but it isn't too difficult if you are willing to put in a bit of work to understand the concepts.,75
lazar_radu,5,A,BMGT230H,"Dr. Lazar is a hilarious teacher and really wants his students to succeed in class. Definitely take this class instead of the regular version, it's much easier.",75
lazar_radu,5,A,BMGT230H,"Professor Lazar is a great guy. He makes his class much more engaging and the concepts are easier to grasp than the regular version of 230. The tests are all multiple choice, compared to the regular class which has short answer questions. Highly recommend this class!",75
daniels_richard,2,A,BMGT380,"I almost always agree with the OurUMD ratings but in this case, I completely do not understand these reviews. He is a horrible teacher. Daniels is terribly unorganized and all over the place. The class has no routine. Every day feels like it's his first day ever teaching. Even by the last month of the semester, you'll have no idea how class is going to run. He loves to talk about himself and his cases, and he loves to show videos from movies that are completely irrelevant to what we're learning. Basically, class involves sitting in class and listening to him rant about law, then trying to write down as much as you can so you can look up the key words and concepts later. Students who ask questions in class are often told, ""look it up on your own later."" The guy is a horrendous teacher. He constantly tells us not to become lawyers because it's horrible. He seems quite miserable. He also does not believe in holding office hours in Smith, so if you want to talk to him you have to take a trip to his law office. He's a jerk. He's one of those teachers who you look at and wonder, how did you get a job at this university?

Also, a tip to students taking him, READ THE SYLLABUS BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS. He expects that on the first class, you've read chapter one. ",76
daniels_richard,3,B,BMGT380,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review on a teacher. I signed up for Daniels because of the great reviews he had below. They were extremely misleading. Here's how Daniels and his class actually is (btw this isn't a review being written by a bitter student, I got a B in the class):

To sum Daniels up in 2 words would be arrogant a$$h0le.

Pros:
- reading the book is helpful, but not mandatory. he spends most of class lecturing, so you end up having in your notes everything you need to know for the exams (that is if you can write fast enough to catch everything he's saying).
- he lets you take the exams at home. if you email him a week before the exam and tell him you're overwhelmed and have a lot of other exams that same week, he'll email you the exam for you to take at home. 2 midterms and a final. obviously you can't do this for all exams. 
- he does sometimes have interesting stories about cases he's had or court room stories
- he shows movie clips in the beginning of class (except he starts them 15 min before class actually starts. if you're early to class, you're on time. if you're on time, you're late. if you're late, he'll embarrass you in front of the class)
- sometimes it's funny when he embarrasses people in front of the class..unless you're the one he's calling out

Cons (oh god, where to start):
- sooo disrespectful. If you ask him a question, he'll make you feel like an idiot and make you regret ever asking.
- it's hard to keep up with taking notes. i had a lot of half finished bullet points because you don't want to miss what he's about to say.
- the 1st half of the semester, he'll randomly call on people to play the attorneys on both sides for a case that you have to read for homework. aka stand in front of the class and be criticized by daniels. Sometimes there'll be 4 different cases in a chapter and you won't know which one he's going to use the following class. 
- the exams have an essay portion, which is fine, but he looks for a certain number of phrases and definitions. for each phrase you include, you get points. for each phrase you don't include, you lose points. How are you supposed to know which phrases/words he wants to see in your essay response? Good question. He seems to forget that we're not law students.
- Participation is 10% of the grade. You don't know what your grade is until the end of the semester and he doesn't have a system for giving out these grades. He'll give you anywhere from a 1 to a 10. He bases the grade on how much he likes or dislikes you. I attended every single class but got under a 5 for participation because ""going to class is expected."" I'm not really a raise my hand and voice my opinion type of student, so someone who came to class 5 times and participated each time probably got a higher grade than me, even though I never once missed class. 

It's really just frustrating to sit through a class being taught by such a disrespectful and rude individual. He never once called me out in class or did any of those obnoxious things to me, so that's not why this review is being written. I just think people should know what they're actually getting themselves into. 

Oh and when did grades come up? Final exam was December 19. Grades were officially due December 22 or 23, but rules don't apply to the almighty Professor Daniels. Several people emailed him asking when grades would come up, he never answered those emails. Grades finally went up January 2, 2013.

daniels_richard,5,A,BMGT380,"Fantastic teacher! Always keeps lecture very interesting and uses a lot of stories from real cases. He's a big fan of movies related to courtroom cases and law and will show a lot of clips. If you put in the effort to memorize terms, you'll have no problem doing well. It's a good idea sitting up front so he gets to know you.",76
daniels_richard,5,A,BMGT380,Excellent professor. The lectures are very interesting since he will use real life examples. The best thing is he will tell you exactly what is on the exam so you dont even need to read the book. His exams are very easy since he goes over everything during the review. This is my favorite class  so far.,76
daniels_richard,5,,BMGT380,"Professor Daniels is easily my favorite teacher. He actually makes me enjoy class and makes it really easy to learn the material.

daniels_richard,5,A,BMGT380,Excellent professor. Lectures are very interesting. He does well at interacting with the class. I agree with the previous comment. He does pick favorites but do not get discouraged because he DOES pay attention on who is engaged and whether you are listening during lecture. My best advice would be to sit in the front. I used to record his lectures and listen to them. Managed to get A's in all his exams since he goes over everything on the exams during class. Excellent professor. ,76
daniels_richard,5,A,BMGT380,"Professor Daniels is an excellent teacher. He is a real practicing lawyer, and brings his knowledge to the classroom. He keeps class interesting by showing clips from movies and telling hilarious stories from the courtroom. 

Some people may find the test hard because they are mostly essay. 

He does pick favorites very early on in the semester. He will remember these few people's names and no one else's and mostly call on them. This can be discouraging at times if, like me, you are not one of his favorites.",76
daniels_richard,5,A,BMGT380,Daniels is a funny guy and a great professor. Just go to class and get to know him. Additionally it helps to skim the book before class to reinforce the material. He will also go over the exam material before the test so make sure you go to class. He is very generous and understanding- I would take him again. ,76
goldfarb,1,,,"Avoid like the plague. He is condescending, irritating, and tells you how to think without teaching you how to think. Grades are assigned randomly, and there is no telling what receives an A, and what receives a B. Although he teaches graduate school courses, he does not act like it. I am not paying exorbitant tuition to be taught by someone like him.

Everyone I know has a problem with his teaching and his courses. I'm not sure how he's survived this long in the business school.

In conclusion: you don't need to take any course that badly, that you can't take it with another professor.",83
goldfarb,4,B,BMGT461,"Interesting class overall, although I don't think it helps you become an entrepreneur. Course is graded on weekly assignments, including case studies and videos, which are discussed in class. During the semester a business is to be created and run throughout with randomly assigned team members. There are two ways to get an A in the course, by making a significant amount of profit or having more points by winning competitions based on the business through the semester. Several groups in all sections have to turn away from their first idea and pivot to another to survive. On the plus side, the lowest grade in the syllabus is a C with 0's for everything.",83
goldfarb,1,C,BMGT461N,"Course work is very tedious, especially trying to run a business on top of other classes. Takes a couple hours extra a week on top of weekly assignments. People with a large social media following are likely to do well in the course. Be prepared to give about 5 pitches throughout the semester, which are between 3 to 5 minutes. HE IS NOT AN ENTREPRENEUR so it's hard to learn from him. Class is also very long and boring.",83
leete,1,,BMGT380,"He is a fine professor, but not an easy one. The test is all multiple choice, some many of them involve case. The curves a lot because nobody did very well on his crazy hard test. You can take him if you don't mind to have a bad grade.",86
leete,5,A,BMGT380,"Professor Leete is a hilarious and engaging lecturer. His classes consist of half lecture, and half cold calling on students to read and explain cases. Overall there is a lot of required reading, and the exams can be very challenging. That being said, he offers a substantial curve on all of the exams, especially the first one, and I can say I learned quite a bit from this class.",86
leete,5,A,BMGT380,"Leete was a great professor. He was really funny and made up really good examples in class to illustrate his points. The exams could be challenging, but if you pay attention in class and do the reading, you should do okay. He also curved the exams a lot -- on the first exam, I think a middle-C became an A. He called on people randomly, but since the class was pretty big, I only had to present a case twice the whole semester. I would still come to class prepared every day though.",86
leete,5,A-,BMGT380,"He is a great teacher. He gives entertaining examples and makes the class fun while covering the material.He also really cares about the students.
He gives 3 tests and an optional final. His tests are challenging but they have large curves (75% + is ussually and A).

His wry sense of humor keeps things interesting. Reading the book will really help reinforce what he talks about in class and explains things fairly well. He only tests on the things he covers in class, which  is nice. The exams are multiple choice and can be challenging, mainly because of the wording of the questions and answers, but he normally curves anywhere from 10-15%. And the final is optional.",86

leete,4,A,BMGT380,"Getting a B is common in this class. If you study the book well you'll be fine. He posts his powerpoint slides online but you don't really need them to study.

you have to go to class because he randomly calls on people to summarize case studies. the book is kind of boring but explains the material pretty well.

Tests can be pretty rough. A lot of the questions test you on application of the subjects. there is usually a huge curve on the exams though",86
leete,4,,BMGT380,"Strengths
Dr. Leete is a funny guy and tried to make classes interesting. His examples and stories were funny and it wasn't too bad of a class. It could be very boring at times, but he did his best. I didn't mind going to that class too much, though it was somewhat boring. But a lot of it is practical for everyday life which made it good. He curves tests a lot as well. Definitely go to class as it's helpful and case briefings when called on randomly count for your grade.  The final was optional for us and he told you your projected final grade, so if you were satisfied you didn't have to take the final. It wasn't too difficult to get a B, but hard to get an A. If you put the time in to study and learn the material really well, you should be fine. 
Drawbacks
The tests are extremely challenging. To compensate for this he curves a lot. The book is boring and dry but thats not his fault.",86
leete,1,B-,BMGT380,"Do not take B-Law with Leete. He seems like a decent enough man but this has been the most frustrating class I've taken at UMD due to his lack of information or organization. The only grades for the whole class are 3 midterm exams, the final exam, and participation. The syllabus gives zero information as to how any of these are weighted and the exams are extremely difficult and are heavily curved as a result. He doesnt upload grades to ELMS and therefore you have no idea what exactly your grade is in the class. We've taken two exams so far and all he does is give us a raw score and a letter grade, with no precise numerical grade or how the grades are weighted, so I know my two letter grades for the exam but have no idea what my actual grade in the class is. In class he's a decent lecturer but he can barely hear anymore so asking questions you sometimes have to repeat yourselves multiple times and a lot of times he answers questions in a strange way, leading me to believe he oftentimes doesn't understand what the student is asking.

The workload isn't super high for this class, and while the content is somewhat challenging it isn't completely unreasonable, but the way the class is taught it's an absolute nightmare and I regret choosing this as one of my business electives.",86
reyna,5,A-,BMGT380,Funny guy! Pay attention and come prepared for class to do well. ,87
reyna,1,C-,BMGT380,"To be honest, Reyna has a good personality; he is funny and loves to talk about related cases in class, but he is not as supportive while it comes to learning the course materials. Reyna is a smart guy, and he has VERY high expectations for his students. I understand this is a challenging course, especially during the pandemic, but additional help for the students could mean so much. He does not have any TA in this class, and there is nothing else to help you study besides reading the book and cases and listen to his lecture. The reading is confusing, but you can learn something from it if you put enough time to read through it. 
The exams wroth 80% of the total grade, but there are SO many typos in the exams, making the complicated exam questions even more difficult to understand.
10% of quizzes are not helpful either; it has nothing to do with the exams; it contains some basic knowledge and a writing prompt, and it could cause you to get points off if you mess up ( FYI, he is a harsh grader on the writing portion of the quiz and exams). 
Another 10% would be presenting cases in class. Rayna encourages students to do so because, in that way, we will have a ""conversation"" directly with him. I understand that he is trying to get people to engage in class, but I also believe that he is not considerate enough for all students. I am not a person who would give up easily, but the current situation makes me feel like I have no hope in this course.
Lastly, If you are good in Law stuff and willing to challenge yourself, you should take him. But for a student who speaks English as a second language and or wants an easy A, you might want to reconsider your options. 
",87
reyna,1,D+,BMGT380,Professor Reyna is a harsh grader and doesn’t explain the material well. He expects his students to be like law students and know the material before getting to class so he doesn’t have to teach. He tries to be funny but comes off as condescending and does not try to help students pass the course. He grades unnecessarily hard as he says not to go off of the book but to do it his way which he doesn’t explain well. ,87

dezso,5,A,BUSI683,"One of the best professors on economics and the global environment. Very intelligent; pushes students to think beyond their comfort zone.

He deserved that Krowe award. Wished he taught more classes",94
kass,5,A-,BMGT440,"David Kass is one of the best professors in business school. he is easygoing and not that picky. if you study a little bit, you will be fine. he talks about Warren Buffett all the time. I enjoyed his class and learned a lot.


",98
kass,3,,BMGT440,"Kass is overall a nice guy. He is very knowledgeable and offers interesting stories about Warren Buffet just about every class. Unfortunately, his lectures are typically boring and the way he assigns grades is more or less random. The majority of your grade consists of projects/assignments. He falls asleep during just about every presentation so who knows how he actually assigns grades to them. He makes it seem like he is very relaxed at the start of the course, and he is fairly flexible most of the time,but beware, there is no leniency when it comes to grades. Even over a couple basis points. ",98
kass,5,A+,BMGT340,"Kass is a very likable guy, and good professor. His class is very laid back, and can run a little dry at times. He always manages to keep the class relevant though with current event discussion before the lecture. He also genuinely cares about his students, and makes an effort to ensure everyone is on the same page before moving on.

On a side note, I would just like to talk about his obsession with Warren Buffett. At least once, if not more, in each lecture Kass will go silent and he will start grinning ear to ear. He will then proceed to gush over the magic of Warren Buffett or Berkshire Hathaway for five good minutes. He also often mentions his Buffett-centric blog or his Buffett related tweets almost daily. This really doesn't impact my opinion of him in any way, but it's impossible to write a review of him without mentioning it.

Overall I enjoyed his class very much, and learned very much, albeit with not very difficult material.",98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,"Professor Kass is a pretty straightforward and laid-back professor. He has a lot of knowledge about financial management and corporate finance, and he is very helpful to his students (and is almost always available either in his office or by e-mail). 

Although BMGT440 with Professor Kass is one of the easier finance courses in the program, you can certainly learn a lot from him and his class if you choose to do so. 

BMGT440 is pretty much an extension of BMGT340 that allows you to gain experience in financial analysis and DCF valuation with actual case studies and projects. 

Overall, I strongly recommend Professor Kass for this course. He is a very kind professor and is very willing to help you learn a lot and to receive a good grade in the process of doing so.",98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,"You get as much out of this course as you want to. Kass has a PhD from Harvard and knows just about everything regarding today's economy, so he can be a great resource for those of you who really want to learn from him. But if you're lazy and just want an easy A, that's fine too; this class is very easy and an overwhelming majority receives A's. Assignments consist of about nine-ten 1-2 page case summaries, a group case project/presentation, a final group project/presentation, an individual case, and a midterm for which you are basically given the questions ahead of time and are allowed to use a notesheet. 

Kass is incredibly nice (almost a pushover) and the class itself puts the material you learn in BMGT340 to real-life practice and gives you practical experience valuing companies. 

No complaints",98
kass,3,A,,"Very easy to get a B. You honestly have to just study the day or so before to get a B. An A on the other hand, you have to quiet work for it and do very well on his stupid exams, which he pulls questions out of his ass. I got a B for not doing anything, and always skipped. So I guess he is an easy grader, but he is a DOUCHE BAG, especially when you send him emails. Certified douche needs to retire.",98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,"Great professor. Class consists of case write ups, a few presentations, an individual case project, a midterm, and an optional final. 

People like to take this class since it's ""easy"". I think it's definitely less stressful compared to other classes where you fight for any grade you get, so you can learn Finance at your own pace. I actually learned a little bit from Professor Kass, although I would have liked it if he went deeper into some of his material, like Black-Scholes. He's an old man, so cut him some slack if he falls asleep during presentations. Great teacher though",98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,"Awesome! Do take. The person below described well, i wont bother.",98
kass,5,B+,BMGT340F,"Wont actually learn anything, but super easy course",98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,"Professor Kass is very laid-back and very knowledgeable. His lecture is a bit dry but it's very clear, easy to follow, and can be related with real-world events so you will learn a thing or two by going to lectures. He also talks about Warren Buffet all the time. He is not hard on students, meaning you don't have to necessary went to every class. However I found his class very enjoyable that it was more worth to go and I learned a lot from him.  

Exams are all very easy and the mean is always around 90/100, and very similar to his sample problems in class. But the quality and grades of team projects highly depend on the teammates on your team, so pick your teammate wisely if you want to get a good grade above A-! Grading can be a bit random but generally if you put your effort in studying the materials, an ""A"" should not be hard to get. ",98
kass,5,A+,BMGT440,Great professor. Lectures are a bit dry but he is really accommodating and willing to go out of his way to help you. Make sure you pick a good team at the start of the semester as this will largely impact your grade. Study a bit before the exams and you should be fine. Projects do help you learn a lot. I would definitely take a class by him again. He also loves talking about buffett.,98
kass,5,A,BMGT440,extremely sweet professor who basically reminds you of a typical grandpa. the course material is not very intensive and the midterm and final are directly based off practice problems from class. The group project was challenging and tedious but it was really the only work I had for the the class. Definitely recommend taking 440  with Kass!,98
kass,4,A,BMGT440,Kass is overall a nice guy and the class is pretty easy. The exams he tells you exactly what will be on them however there are a lot of homework assignments like case summaries. Also 2 group projects are presented. The class is pretty boring though and the pace is really slow so most people just don't show up to lectures. ,98
kressler,1,B,BMGT495,"This is the most incompetent teacher I have ever had. Unable to use a computer and send out simple emails, but teaches a class that is mostly computer based. Thinks the class is wrong when he makes stupid mistakes. Grades unnecessarily hard. ",100
milton_jeffrey,4,,BMGT323,"I had Milton for 323 and 417, and contrary to the one review on this website, I thought he was great. Milton is a slow talker and he is not that interesting, but I still think he is a great professor as a whole. 

Use of class time: He spends class going through the publishers power points, which have example problems in them, and if you pay attention you will learn from his lectures. Usually the class before and exam we will play jeopardy.  

Homework: For homework, he uses McGrawhill Connect. You will have one assignment every week, they are not long and are not too hard. You also get unlimited tries, so everyone should be able to get 100%. Homework is 30% of your grade which is great. 

Textbook: This is one of those classes where you should read the textbook (about 1 chapter a week). The exams are open book, and it is much easier to take advantage of that if you have read the book and can navigate it easily. 

Quizzes: We did not have quizzes for 323, but we did for 417. They are all multiple choice and open book/notes. 

Exams: The exams are all multiple choice and open book/ notes. They are very fair, and Milton gives more than enough time for exams and quizzes. Also he often recycles quiz and jeopardy questions for exams.",103

kiss,5,A,BMGT445,"She's not the most entertaining professor out there, but she explains everything very well, is extremely nice, and has tons of experience. She really wants everyone to do well in her class. Her class is made of two exams each worth 32% or 33%, a group presentation, case studies (or ProBanker, if in the Fellows sections), and homework. Her reviews will prepare very well for the exams, since she will tell you exactly want is going to be in them. Usually, they consist of a few multiple choices, short answers, and problems, which are not too bad. Overall, I enjoyed the class, because I have an interest in the field, and an A is not really difficult to get. If you take her class, I'm sure you won't regret it!!!",106
kiss,3,A,BMGT445,"She is definitely here as a result of tenure. Don't get me wrong, she is a very sweet lady and really wants her students to succeed. She is definitely very knowledgeable about banking and is a great resource if you are going in that field. Her class consists of homework,a group presentation, a group case study, and 2 exams worth 33% each. Her classes are brutally boring and she even admits to using some of the same slides from 20 years ago. She is unfortunately a boring teacher and is all over the place. Luckily, her exam reviews and homework will adequately prepare you for her exams, she will act like they are a mystery, but trust me, they are predictable. I guess I have mixed feelings about whether or not you should take her. Getting an A is not too difficult if you study, but if you are looking for a superb professor keep searching. ",106
kiss,5,A+,BMGT445,"One of the best teachers in the business school. She cares about her students, and displays 100% effort in teaching finance and banking. As long as you go to class, you will learn a lot. She is extremely knowledgeable. ",106
kiss,4,c,BMGT340,"BMGT340 is actually a decend class to get a B in. I recieved a C- due to slacking but if you go to every class, which can be painful, you will not have any trouble getting a B if not an A in her class. Many students were able to 100s on her exams. As for studying do not memorize the material, rather learn it and understand it. Her exams consist of actual equations as well as technical questions which can be very tricky. As for a person Prof. Kiss does truely have a soul. I was going to recieve a D+ in her class but after explaining how much this would set me back, she reasoned with me and gave me a C-. Go to class and you will reap the reward of a good grade. ",106
kiss,5,A,BMGT340,"Let me start this off by saying I took this class in the summer, so maybe it was a bit different. But I absolutely loved Professor Kiss. She was always readily available with help via email. While she did take time to explain what was due when at the beginning of class, it always helped. Often times when not many people would come to class she wille explain exactly how to do her extra credit assignments. While going through her powerpoints, she always points out which questions will be on her exams. 

As other people stated she does talk about her previous job as a CFO, but that is only to help the students better understand.

I'm not any type of business major, but I found this class very interesting and she made it easy.

You will absolutely get an A if you go to all the classes. ",106

kiss,1,A,BMGT445,Professor Kiss is the argument against tenure for teachers. Her class is painfully hard to follow and she doesn't even go over her slides. Her technique on teaching is tell a story and then run over 9 slides without saying anything except this slide will be on the exam. Whatever finance students can do to not take this class with her will bode well for your education. ,106
kiss,3,A,BMGT340,"Kiss is probably the nicest yet most ineffective teacher I've had at UMD. She seems to really care about helping her students, but she really wasn't a good teacher. She wastes the first 15 minutes of class going over what's due and when, and other things we already know. When she does teach, she jumps around from topic to topic and from the ppts in the course pack and her own ""better"" ppts, making her difficult to follow.  I eventually just stopped going to her class and went to White's class and I know this is the reason I did better on the last 2 exams. All three teachers of 340 (White, Kiss, Hallows) all taught the same things and gave out the same exam so it really didn't matter which teacher you went to.
This class had 5 projects, like 8 hw assignments, and 7 extra credits. Thank goodness for the extra credits. This class was a ton of work, but as long as you put in the effort, it is possible to get an A.",106
kiss,2,b,BMGT340,Take this with White. Kiss goes on and on about being a CFO and how the other teachers changed her slides. She doesn't teach this course well at all. Don't take it with her you will get an A with White not Kiss. ,106
kiss,3,C,BMGT340,"Dr. Kiss has really good intentions.  She is extraordinarily accessible and responds quickly (in person, class, office hours) to any questions you have.  You can tell she really cares.

However, I find her to be an inefficient teacher.  She spends so much time showing us what is on ELMS and repeating random facts about her life that have no relevance to the topic at hand.  She's a lovely person, but wastes so much class time that we never get through all of the topics!  It's frustrating when you go to do homeworks and practice problems to realize you never did any sample problems in class!

I would not take this class with her (although I heard from rumors she was better than White).  If you have to take it, go to the TAs for help.  It's a big work load, and definitely tough.  The exams are super hard.",106
kiss,5,A,,"very knowledgeable!She gives out three exams (25% each)(final is non-cumulative). Assigned hw (10% of total grade) + Group Project (15%). Lectures are very imformative and enhances understanding of subject by relating to her personal experiences. B4 exams she posts sample practice exams and many question from them would appear in exam. SO practice and understand them.
Easy A with little work and effort. :)",106
kiss,4,,BMGT340,"Great professor. We had three exams, one group project, and 3-4 homework problems from each chapter. Exams are easy and straight forward. She worked in the finance field for a really long time, and always related the boring textbook material to real world stories, which really helped us to understand the stuff better. Very approachable outside of the classroom. There were always tons of materials posted on blackboard to help you learn finance. You do need the book, and read it before the exam, since one third of the exam was conceptual questions -  but they are not hard at all! 

Overall, I think she's one of the best professors in the business school.",106
kiss,5,A+,BMGT445,"Go to class, do the assignments, study for test, and an A will not be hard to get.",106
kiss,5,A,BMGT445,"I don't know why people criticize her on her voice or her tenure. I think she is a very good professor with tons of industry experience that her lecture will be related with her real world experience. Every lecture she tried her best to make the class not boring, and she care about her students by giving detailed exam reviews and sending recordings of her lectures to those who have excused absence (which I believe a lot of people benefited by this a couple of times). 

Though her lectures can be dry sometimes, and she talks a lot about assignments and events coming up, but her lectures are easy to follow and understand. Moreover the exam problems are mostly based on her exam reviews therefore making the course very easy; think about it, other instructors won’t spend extra time to do this – but she did – so she still care a lot on her students. And I strongly agree with “Go to class, do the assignments, study for test, and an A will not be hard to get.” 

Btw her husband Steven is a very nice and funny person as well.
",106
kiss,5,,BMGT440,"Prof. Elinda really wants her students to pass the class and learn. She will go over and over things you might not understand, always asks for questions and does not care if she takes time from her lectures to help students understand things. She will give her best to give exams that replicate homework and class work. But you have to put some input, bare minimum to get a C, little more if you want an A. Homework and cases she gives can be a little bit too much at a time, but doing them it really pays off for exam. We only had one exam due to pandemic, but we have extra cases and takeover project. 
Overall recommend this professor for Finance courses",106
studer-ellis,5,B,BMGT230B,"Great professor!  A lot of fun, the notes were very easy since he gives you the packet and you just have to fill in the blanks.  I had already taken stats in high school though, which made things easier, and it seemed other students were struggling with what seemed like simple concepts.  Do a lot of practice problems, and ask questions.",109
studer-ellis,5,A,BMGT230,"This class isn't too difficult, but you have to understand how things work.  It's not enough to know formulas, you have to understand the inner workings.

Studer-Ellis is very helpful and frequently asks in lectures if anyone has questions.  He tries very hard to make sure his students succeed as much as possible.

That said, he can be strict sometimes.  If you have an 89.9, he won't round it up to an A.  If he offers extra credit, you have to be in the right lecture.  However, all of this is clearly stated on the first day, so it shouldn't come as a surprise.  He is tough but fair.",109
studer-ellis,5,A-,BMGT230,"Very good professor. You don't have to buy any book or anything just copy of HIS notes for $20. He follows those notes completely. He is always ready to answer any questions you might have for him. He makes the class fun to be in. Will take another class with him, if possible.",109
studer-ellis,5,A-,BMGT230B,"Studer-Ellis was a very knowledgeable and fun professor who was easy to learn from. He taught the material in a very organized manner which made the fairly difficult material easier to learn and understand. Going to lectures is important, but I wouldn't recommend signing up for the 8AM lecture if possible as it is sometimes hard to stay awake.",109
studer-ellis,5,A-,BMGT230,"Awesome Professor, its worth going to lecture. The best way to tackle this class is to write terms down for each part of each equation and do a detailed note sheet, write the topic it is on and the conditions about it. If your note sheet is good you will do very well here. And also do the HWs, not doing one will leave u clueless.",109
studer-ellis,3,C,BMGT230,"Studer-Ellis is the best professor on campus, hands down. I have never had a professor who worked so hard to make sure students grasp information. I am a statistics/math dummy and I somehow am managing a C in this class! Do not take this course without Studer-Ellis.",109
studer-ellis,5,A,BMGT230,"Excellent professor with an excellent ability to teach the material.  My first statistics course ever, and I totally excelled thanks to his teachings.  He doesn't require a text. Instead, students pay like $20 for a copy of HIS notes, which are phenomenal.  You must go to class though in order to grasp an understanding of the notes, but class attendence is well worth it.  Attend his classes, go to discussions, and study (homework problems, old exams, and activity sheets) and you can definitely earn an A!!  Exams are very fair and all or the majority of problems are very similary to problems covered in homework/activity sheets.  Highly recommended for anyone looking to take stats.
",109
studer-ellis,4,A,BMGT230B,"S-E was a really good professor. He uses a course packet that he created himself which he follows during his lectures so you don't have to write a lot and you don't have to buy a textbook. He also gives a lot of review sessions. Some tests are challenging while others are easier, but overall the course is enjoyable. ",109
studer-ellis,5,A,BMGT230,ES is a very good professor.  He is always willing to help students if they need it (he holds review sessions before every homework assignment is due and before every exam).  He is very energetic however his persona does tend to get tiresome towards the end of the semester.  The class itself is pretty simple as long as you do the practice exams in the course packet and make a decent cheat sheet.  Its importnt to do the practice exams because he often reuses questions.  For the final about 1/4 or more of the questions came from the first 3 exams we had taken. ,109
studer-ellis,5,,BMGT230,"The best teacher I've ever had here at UMD. Very serious about getting us to learn Stats and succeed. He even offered a help session for our homeworks. He offers extra credit to help boost our grade because there is not much of a curve. If you go to every class, every lecture(which are always entertaining), do every homework correctly, have a good cheat sheet, and do your best on the exams(which are hard, but similar to practice exams that he gives us), then you are going to do well. He is always there to help, and I was so thankful for that. To tell you the truth, I took another stats course and used Studer-Ellis' notes to get me through that class, and A-ced it. The course is very challenging, but its worth it in the end.",109
studer-ellis,5,A+,BMGT230B,"Took the class Fall 2007. Going to lecture makes this class significantly easier and likewise, skipping makes it way harder. Must attend discussion to turn in homework and do activities that are worth points. Tests are much easier if you do the practice exams beforehand (they're not difficult to begin with, really). He is an energetic animated professor, really makes coming to lecture worth it. Gives extra credit during lecture but doesn't announce when and you must be at your lecture (as opposed to going to a different one). Overall great class",109
studer-ellis,3,,BMGT230B,"He's weird and goofy, tests are pretty challenging but manageable. you need to go to class to learn the material. he gives extra credit based on the distribution of grades in the class but its only given in lectures so again, you must attend.",109
studer-ellis,3,,BMGT230B,"If you need a stat requirement but not necessarily business stat, don't take this class, because its probably the hardest of them.  But if you need to take this class, just become familiar with old exam problems and practice problems before the test, because they are very similar.  People tend not to do very well on the exams, and depending on how people are doing, he will give extra credit, which is his version of a curve.  Studer-Ellis is very animated and fun.. he wants students to succeed and is always willing to give extra help.  A lot of students just find the material challenging and you will have to study!",109
studer-ellis,5,A,BMGT230B,"I took this class Fall 2004, and from what I hear it has changed a lot. He is a great professor. SE is very enthusiastic and wants his students to succeed. He is always accessible outside of class, each week he held a session to ask questions about the homework. Before exams, he would host a 2 hour review session. Each week there is a problem set due and an activity sheet to do in discussion on Friday. They are graded on a very lenient scale. He uses a course packet that is loaded with practice problems and old exams. If you work the problems and old exams you will do well on his tests--he often uses the same problems as from the packet, homework or activity sheets. He HATES when students arrive late or leave early. He will stop class until these students are seated or out of the room. Overall, it isn't too difficult of a class if you do the studying and practice and GO TO CLASS! They really are not boring so I don't see why anybody would have an issue with them. ",109
studer-ellis,4,B-,BMGT230,"Loved Erich, he really does a great job at keeping you invested in the class with his goofiness/humor. He knows his subject well, and demonstrates it with great elaboration. My only frustration is that when it came to test questions/prep his only answer is ""anything & everything is fair game"". Unfortunately due to the vagueness I found myself struggle on the first test, because he didn't just give us plug & chug questions but also conceptual ones. While it's technically 'fair game' it would have been nice to be made aware (he teaches to the material, not the test which I understand), unfortunately his homeworks have minimal conceptual questions but otherwise do prepare you well for tests.",109
studer-ellis,5,C-,BMGT230,"Erich is a great teacher, my crappy grade in the class isn't a reflection of his teaching, I'm just bad at math in general even though I worked my a** off for this class. Erich is very lively and uses up the entire lecture time which is great. His homework problems appear on the exams which is also good and he gives you a full sized front and back piece of paper to use for notes on each exam, and 3 sheets on the final (all 8 1/2 x 11). Like I said, I was determined to do good on these exams and I would study hours on end but clearly to no avail for myself.

studer-ellis,4,B-,BMGT230,Erich is so funny. He really cares his students succeeding in his class. I would highly recommend him if you're interested in business but this class was not my thing lol. I would've failed the class if there wasn't such a huge curve.,109
studer-ellis,2,C,BMGT230,"I have nothing bad to say about Erich, but this class is TOUGH. Easily the hardest class I have taken in my life, requires a LOT of work. You either get it or you don't. No in between. My lack of stars is because of the class, not about Erich. ",109

He follows the packet completely and it has everything you need–you won't even need a notebook for his class. There's an old examination in the packet before  each exam which is VERY helpful, but unfortunately there aren't any other sources outside of that for practice problems so for the exam you mostly just review the problems he did during the notes and memorize formulas. That being said, he really wants you to do well, is very responsive to emails and questions, and offers a weekly help-session to go over the homework. He's so energetic that it's hard to not be engaged–he'll literally be jumping around the lecture hall and (playfully) yelling about statistics. I didn't find the material engaging but the class is still very well run.",109

Erich makes coming to class each day entertaining, just don't take out your phones!",109

studer-ellis,5,B,BMGT230B,"Erich is super high energy and tries his best to make bstat fun. The course packet is awesome and makes it easy to take notes and study. It's easy to tell that Erich cares a lot about seeing his students do well, as he makes himself available and allows note sheets for exams. ERICH S-E IS THE MAN!",109
studer-ellis,4,A,BMGT230B,"If you’re okay at math, this class should be fine. Erich gives you everything you need to understand the material, although he will put 2 to 4 new or newly phrased questions on exams. You get two attempts for every exam and at least for the pandemic semester(s), they are open-note. There are three exams including the final, which is just treated like another exam, and they make up 80% of your grade. Only TAs have office hours, but they can definitely be helpful, only thing is you can’t ask questions about an exam in between two of its test dates which sucks if you genuinely don’t know how to solve a problem that you’ve never seen before. If you’re taking the class at home, just buy the course packet or print it yourself, it’s so much easier to follow along the material if you have it in front of you rather than using the online version. 

The class is completely asynch, but you get a dose of Erich’s personality through the videos. I thought he was nice and I didn’t experience this myself, but according to our class groupme, he wasn’t lenient at all about late work or extensions or taking an exam at a later date if it was for anything but having a conflicting class or another exam, which is really sucky in a pandemic. The exams are also always some time in the evening and not set during class time. He posts a different number of lecture videos each week which can also be a little disorienting as you don’t know what to expect with how long you’ll be watching them or how many videos you need to watch to do the weekly problems. 

There are two weekly problem sets, one that is a little more difficult that you work on with an assigned group and that I think is graded only on completion but he wasn’t really clear on that and one that you do on your own that is pretty straight forward and graded on accuracy, but you can still get a question or two wrong and get a 100. To study for tests, redoing these will help. He posts the answer keys after they are due for both and review videos going through the problems for the exercise set only (the one you do on your own). 

He curves at the end of the semester based on the class, this fall an 84 was an A-. ",109
studer-ellis,5,A+,BMGT230B,"Erich is one of the best professors I have ever had in my life. I took his statistics course back in 2018 and I'm so glad I attended almost every lecture. In his words, if you skip class you are just wasting your parents' money, so why skip class? His course notes were extremely helpful, as he went thru it with detail and taught us straight from them as if they were a textbook. We knew exactly what to learn and focus on especially with the tons of examples and visuals in the notes.

The weekly discussions and homeworks also helped me alot in preparing for the exams. No tricks, no BS, if you knew how to do the problems you were guaranteed to do well on the exams. 

I totally wish more professors adopted this same type of ""course notes"" teaching style for their classes. Can you imagine if Erich was somehow cloned so that those other Erichs taught 221 accounting or 340 finance or STAT400? I would have learned so much easier and done so much better on exams. For comparison's sake I got an A+ in 230 but in STAT400 I only got a C (fortunately I was able to do P/F lol).

Erich, if you're reading this please think about teaching more classes besides 230 man. You would be doing every business student a huge favor.",109
seo_myeong-gu,5,A,BMGT363,"One of the best professors I have ever had the pleasure of learning under. He is extremely gracious and has a genuine interest in ensuring you have a handle on the material he teaches. He wants to make sure you understand the value of leadership and leaves you with skills you can take and apply in the workplace as soon as you leave the room. He grades very leniently because he is more interested in seeing your effort to grasp the material and interest in the coursework than he is in destroying your GPA. Plus he's just a really nice guy. Never saw him get upset or flustered once this semester. HIGHLY recommended. I only took 363 because it fit my schedule and does not required a textbook, but I am SO glad I took it.",110

There are no due dates listed and as I sit here and prepare for the final, there is currently one grade on elms. I have no idea where I stand in the course and find it extremely frustrating that he has yet to grade a damn thing.  ",112

schlake_oliver,3,A,BMGT289E,"Schlake's a funny guy to talk to, but his class was organized horribly, and his lectures were pretty boring. Maybe it's just the content of the course, which feels so much like ""common sense"" that you rarely ever feel like you're actually learning something new. His grading seems really arbitrary and he's not at all transparent about it. I managed an A but it was definitely not an easy A.",112
bulmash,5,A,BMGT410,"Let me start by saying that Government Accounting is not an easy course by any means, but Prof. Bulmash made it so much more accessible. He is a great instructor, probably one of the best accounting professors at UMD, always available to help, and has a great sense of humor. He wants to make sure that everyone understands and is comfortable with the material. Overall, the exams are not very difficult, but you are likely to find some questions on material that you may not necessarily have encountered during your study. The project was also very accessible. Overall, this is a great course to take, especially if you want to sit for the CPA, and if you can, take it with Bulmash, since it will make your life much easier!",115
bulmash,5,B,BMGT221,My favorite teacher at UMD. This man cares about his students and makes accounting interesting. Accounting isn't even my major and he kept me interested.

His exams are challenging but As are achievable. He does NOT try to trick you by listing 4 possible answers you can get by making a mistake like other professors do.
Bottom line: Take Bulmash. Don't just take his class, meet him.",115

The course is paced perfectly (1 chapter each week, lecture on Tuesday and example problems on Thursday), and there's hardly any work (practice problems aren't collected. 2 exams, a project, and a final). 
He's great at explaining confusing concepts (pretty much all of them are confusing), he'll answer any and all questions thoroughly, and he's full of stories from his day as an accountant, which help explain concepts and also provide a nice break from talking about journal entries. 
Dr. Loeb gave a guest lecture in my class once, and it was miserable. Bulmash is a far better choice. ",115

During the winter we were graded solely on 3 exams, weighted equally. they were all MC and had 1-2 written problems at the end. The MC is just like the ones he gives you in his practice exams (which are old exams). I recommend studying the book, doing some practice problems for each chapter, and then doing the practice exams. If you can do all that, you will be fine. 

He is always happy to answer any questions that you may have and is a genuinely nice person. 

Make sure you pay attention. Accounting is a class that no one should cram for because there is a lot of memorization and you do need to practice to be able to do the problems. 

As long as you keep up with the work, which is fairly minimal, read the book, pay attention in lecture you will easily get an A.",115

Hated to miss his class even though i did half of the time. Exams are reasonable. Project get a little subjective/confusing though.

Attendance is not mandatory, since the online lectures are recorded and during class, you review the PowerPoints that you should have watched before class. Overall, Bulmash is a fantastic person who takes plain information and equations from a textbook and applies it to the real world.

His lectures are straight from the book so don't waste your time reading anything but the cases.  Take notes on your computer to keep up with him...there are a LOT of notes.  The exams are right out of the notes and he applies all the concepts to situations with Jersey Shore and the Kardashians.",118
mark_gideon,5,A,BMGT380,"I liked him a lot. He is very dry (but so is the subject of business law) with a very wry sense of humor. Pretty straight-forward way of presenting notes, although he does not upload them online. Makes you present a case for a free 10% and then the rest of your grade is just three tests. The tests are 15 T/F and 35 MC which are really straightforward and directly from his notes. Doesn't try to trick you",118

He make the concepts so easy that as long as you are taking good notes and review them well before the exam you are going do really well. He is very knowledgeable, and genuinely likes to help students. He has to be one of the best business law professors-he teaches during the fall so if you need to take bmgt380 make sure you register for his class asap since most of the seats for his class gets taken fairly quickly.

I remember one question asking ""Which of these is an expensive way to ship?"" Answers: Freight, flight, boat.  The 
 answer was boat but wtf okay I guess.
Oh yeah, and he recycles most of his quiz and exam questions from previous semesters.  It's a classic situation of an easy class conceptually with lengthy and confusing multiple choice questions that make up 100% of the grade.",121

mund,2,A,BMGT110F,"Not that amazing tbh... he has a big personality which makes him seem interesting, but once you get into his class and listen to his lectures the class is a lot less engaging. Most of his presentations (which the exams are based on rather than the textbook and 100+ question hw assignments he makes you do that takes 1-2 hours to read through and do) are really poorly made and hard to follow. He teaches in a more auditory way rather than visually which can be hard for people who want to take notes during class. He will put either 1-4 words on a slide or a picture and go into profuse details on it which is hard to follow bc he talks really fast and is experienced in the field so he speaks like a business person rather than a teacher. A lot of things he'll talk about in his presentations are also sometimes not even in the textbook. Overall, not a hard grader, and his class is pretty easy, but with reason bc with his teaching, if he was a hard grader there would be a lot of people struggling. 

Also, he definitely has favorites and will make sure he calls on everyone in class. Honestly, just disappointed by him bc I thought he'd be one of my favorite teachers and he is currently my least favorite as this semester has goneon. ",128

However, I thought lectures in class were pretty boring and there's a group project worth 25% of your grade that was definitely graded harsher than it needed to be (although, this was graded by the TA, not him).

mund,4,A,BMGT110F,"Mund made it really easy to learn in a pandemic. You can probably get by without reading the textbook but I would recommend it if you’re a business major. Easy midterm and final based totally on the lectures which he makes super engaging. He calls on random people in class but he doesn’t go hard on you if you don’t know what you’re saying. He provides his slides before the midterm and final. Weekly discussion posts that are a little redundant and Connect activities that are a total waste of time. There is a group project which can be a little tough if you don’t have good partners. He doesn’t have a rubric for it which is also tough (just prompts) and the grades are based on how well other people in the class do which sucks, just make sure you put a lot of diagrams and use vocab from the textbook. There is a presentation for the project but it doesn’t seem to be graded, at least it wasn’t on the syllabus or Canvas. Overall, pretty great guy and makes class fun. ",128

Seemed pointless.

And as if her tests werent long and wordy enough, she DOUBLED the amount of questions on her final last minute and said it was to help us. She also does not curve and tends to discipline the whole class saying we didnt put in effort when thats just a minority of students.

He is obsessed with making the class the ""level of work"" required for a 3 credit class and he went well over that and made it a ridiculous class. 50 page reflection paper at the end.

This was by far my least favorite class I have taken at UMD. ",130
wellman,1,A,BMGT289B,"Worst professor ever. Assigns extra class times that were clearly not labeled in the syllabus or in the class times. He claims it was written on testudo, but that is a fallacy.

He assigns too much busy work. Instead of meaningful work that teaches you how innovators think, he is obsessed with making the class as much work as a 3 credit class ""should be"".",130
wellman,5,-A,,"This is a 1 credit course, its not going to meet all the time and its not that hard thats why its 1 credit. Here is what you do to get an A: go to the required speakers (5), read the book Startup of You, go to class. I actually do not think he graded our take-home final, it was never submitted to elms!",130
wellman,4,A,,"Easy A Class. It's only a few short reflections and attendance at lectures (recorded by reflection sheets done while at lecture). These lectures are done by guest speakers. E.g. GE LDP and Goodwill CEO. Very interesting lectures. Be careful though, make sure you attend all the lectures required, there are make up lectures but you are required to have a set # of lectures a semester or else you get a 0 for some of them. At the end of the semester (there is like 135 pts total), he all the sudden adds like an additional 70 points worth of assignments to help people who skipped a lecture. There is no excuse for you not to get an A. ",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT289I,"Very good professor, very tough course. Dr. Wellman is really into business and management and he teaches the material with a lot of enthusiasm. Some of the lectures get a bit boring but overall they're interesting. As others have said, there are the ""one minute memos"" at each lecture which add up to quite a lot of points, so make sure you go to class. There were two special projects/assignments we had to do which also made a big part of our grade, but they were pretty easy to do.

The exams were the only very hard part of this class. The multiple choice questions are incredibly specific and you definitely need to study your ass off to do well on them.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT289I,"I usually don't even bother to fill out the course evaluations for UMD, but I feel the need to give a review for Professor Wellman. Simply put he is one of the best professors that I have experienced so far at UMD, he truly cares about both his students and his class. You will likely learn more from this class than all your other classes combined.

Why do I say this? Because everything you learn from this class is applicable to both your life as a student and more so how to be successful once your out in the real world job market. Understanding what it takes to be successful and what the difference is between unsuccessful and successful companies may sound boring, but Wellman makes it one of the most interesting topics at this school. His ability to tie in current events with his class is excellent and keeps you interested in the class. 

Trust me, this should be a required class before everyone graduates! The out of class assignments are actually useful and don't simply seem like the professor has you do it so they can give you a grade. These assignments are actually interesting and helpful. 

Professor Wellman is extremely easy to talk to, teaches an excellent class, and gives you real world knowledge that is more useful than almost everything else you will learn at this university.

Take this class with Professor Wellman, you won't regret it!",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT289I,"The class is very interesting so even if you are not a business major, you should still take it. Professor Wellman is one of the few outstanding professors I have encountered in the years I have been here. 

Lectures attendance is mandatory because you will be doing a small review of the lecture called ""one minute memo"" and turn them in at the end of class for points. If you miss more than 4 memos, you will be REQUIRED to take a VERY HARD final exam. Personally I did not have to take it but judging from the difficulty of the midterm, it is not a bluff. 

However, lectures and exams are not the only things in this class. The professor does try to expose students new concepts and ideas by actually making us do it. One of those you should be aware is that you will be required to do something called Iliad Assessment, where you have to go through a day as a corporate executive. The assessment include giving a presentation, working on memos, and participate in meetings. Afterward you will be given results and write a development plan for it. 

Another one is an online management simulation where you are trying to get people to adopt the initiative. It's not as hard as it sounds, it's really more like a game. You just have to write reviews and analysis of the simulation afterward. 

One thing I really like is that he tries to stay on current business events. With the passing of Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, the professor assigned the biography of Steve Jobs as our reading assignment. It's actually a great book so I read it anyway. 

As long as you come to lectures and do all the assignments and projects, you will get an A. I highly recommend this class for both the information and the experience.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT289I,"Professor Wellman is one of the best professors I have ever had. Some people do not like his class because he makes you do one minute memos everyday, but I love them, they allow me to follow the lecture and get lots of easy points! His tests are hard but you can get C's on them and still get an A in the class if you do everything else. I have learned so much from his class, I actually look forward to going because his lectures are really interesting and he is an excellent speaker. All in all I would highly recommend taking a course with Wellman as the professor. ",130
wellman,4,A-,BMGT289I,"Professor Wellman is a good professor in the sense that he has been in the business school for a long time and therefore has created strong relationships with other faculty and staff. His teaching style is the only thing that prevents me from giving him a 5 star rating. Although, he knows the material very well, it seemed like he wasn't delivering it effectively. Maybe it was because our class was a 3 hour evening class. 

Overall, this class wasn't too hard. There were very thick packets that he gave out which I never read and still managed to pull away with an A-. Exams were really tricky. The best way to do well on the exams is by reading the power point slides several times and paying attention when he plays the video clips in class about current events. 

He also gave out extra credit several times in class which definitely helped out. I definitely recommend taking this class. ",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"Professor Wellman in my opinion is one of the best professors in the Smith School-He really knows how to teach and keeps his students engaged in the class. He's also a cool guy since he allows flexibility in doing classes whichever time you want despite the section you are registered for. I was registered for the 9:30am class but attended the 12:30 one throughout the entire semester (other than on the test days). 
The breakdown of his class: 
Inclass assignments every class(which are really there for participation points)-(it's like taking notes in class)
Illiad Assessment
A simulation
2 exams 
The final is comprehensive and you don't need to take it if u don't miss more than 4 classes-and that shouldn't be a problem since his classes are so interesting that you wouldn't wanna miss them. 
His tests are freaking easy-i only studied his powerpoints and never read the book other than the first chapter(the book seems interesting though). I don't think I studied more than 2 hours right b4 the exam and did pretty fair on the exams. If only I had studied a lil more I wouldve gotten a B on both exams and that wouldve been enuf for me to get an A in the class. I missed an A by 2% but I thought that was fair given the amount of work I put in for the class. Really interesting&easy class-great professor-the only thing is that Fall2010 was his last term for teaching bmgt 364:(
He did say he was going to be teaching 364H though.",130
wellman,2,B,BMGT364,"The class was alright. You don't learn much about management. Wellman makes you go to every class, but 4 of them. TESTS are ridiculous!! I cannot stress that enough. You need to know every minute detail that are in the videos in order to succeed. DON'T BUY THE BOOK: YOU WILL NOT NEED IT! It is not a thinking test...it is pure memorization. Given this, half of the class does get As because of the other assignments throughout the semester. MAKE SURE TO TAKE EACH ONE SERIOUSLY. They will make or break your grade. Wellman doesn't truly care about any student in the class. He is slow to answer e-mails and very unresponsive at times. Luckily, there are other teachers to take besides him. He is not recommended. It is possible to do well in the class, but you will not get anything out of it.  ",130
wellman,3,A,BMGT364,"Overall a really interesting class. Can't stress how important it is to pay serious attention, because small details can come up on the test. 

You don't need the book at all, I never once looked at mine and I still got an A in the class...

When studying for the exams, rewatch any videos you're unfamiliar with, they are fairgame for exam essays

Great teacher overall, but terrible about getting grades back quickly. Make sure you know where your grades are coming from, there was an inclass assignment that was graded for accuracy and most people didn't realize it would be",130
wellman,4,,BMGT364,"This is the one class that you truly should go to every class. Not to say the content is overly important, but you are graded on attendance. If you go to every class, you'll get about 23% of your overall grade for free and about 2% extra credit, PLUS you won't have to take the final.

The tests are challenging especially if you don't take additional notes during the lectures. I made the mistake of just answering the in-class questions thinking that would be sufficient.

You do have to do a lot of additional stuff, like a three hour business competency assessment and a group simulation project, but those are fairly painless.

Overall, Wellman was a good enough Professor. I fell asleep every class but that was more due to it being at 9:30am because the videos he shows every class are pretty interesting.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364N,"Wellman is a brilliant, fun, and interesting man and teacher. He legitimately cares about his students and has funny little quirks that end up being endearing. His exams are pretty rough, you really have to remember everything you cover so if you have a good memory you'll be fine, but if you're a person that has to learn through repetition or comprehension start studying early. Don't expect an A, but DO EXPECT TO COME OUT FEELING LIKE YOUVE TAKEN SOMETHING FROM THE CLASS. I've definitely learned more from this class than most of my other SEMESTERS as a whole. ",130
wellman,4,A-,BMGT364,"This guy is a great lecturer who shows a lot of interesting videos in class. There are in class assignments worth points, and a discussion section you should go to.

Exams are very challenging. There are going to be a lot of multiple choice questions that make you think ""lol what?"" He offers 8 extra credit points in a semester, and you do need them. I got an A by 0.3 points, but i did average a C on exams. 

On a side note, this guy is really wordy. His syllabus is really long. Wellman is a nice guy though. You are exempted from his final if you miss 4 or less classes. Don't take his final. Its 150 MC and several essays in 2 hours. Punishment for people who skip class",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,This was an amazing class. He is a really cool guy and shows lots of videos in class. The videos really make the class interesting. I suggest going to every class because the information on the videos will be on the exams.,130
wellman,4,A,BMGT364,"I don't work that hard, and I got an A in this class. Here's how: GO TO CLASS. The tests are challenging, so you need those clicker points. I found Wellman to be a boring dude, but the videos that he shows are interesting, so try to get into them, they will show up on the exams. The class is ALL memorization, so if you have trouble with that, don't wait until the last second to study everything - its a lot of info. I didn't have the textbook, I don't think anybody did,  but after I took the exam I looked through a friends and realized that it had A LOT of relevent info in there. What a surprise, the textbook might help you. ",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"This course is academically rigorous. Wellman is a fair grader but his tests are miserable. However, you can easily make up for the tests with the other work in the class. Lectures are actually interesting because we watch videos instead of listening to Wellman talk the whole time. Whether it is because he is smart or too lazy to talk, I have not yet figured out - but it works out for the best either way. I could not think of a better teacher for the class.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"Just received an A in this course.  Gave the professor a 5 even though i thought he was not very approachable because it does what a class is intended to do: teaches you and grades you based on that knowledge.  some questions on the exam were a bit tricky but as long as you attend every lecture, do the few readings (do NOT need to read from the textbook do not know anyone who did), and study for about 3-6 hours, you will do fine.  I honestly don't know who studied for 20 hours (like the person who posted above me) because either you skipped allt he classes and had to cram in the notes/readings last minute or youre just a SLOW learner.  Go to class, do the 1 or 2 article readings a week (less than 30 min of reading a week), and just study for 3 hours before the exam.  Guaranteed A. 

classes were fun/interesting",130
wellman,4,A,BMGT364,"Very good professor. Material is very interesting and you actually learn a lot of things that can be applied to real life. 
Things to note: 1) this class is by no means an easy A. you really have to study your butt off in order to do well on the two exams. (20+ hours) 
2) very bad about grading. Getting grades back, TA's, and even fairness on certain things. 
3) not very responsive. emails to him were addressed about 50% of the time and emails to TA's were addressed about 10% of the time. so if you have an issue with something - good luck. 
4) you only go to fourfriday sections - one for team building, one for illiad, one for everest, and one for the first test (second one is in class). he understands students' want to not have friday discussions 

All in all, I recommend going to every class, taking a crapload of notes, studying hard for the exams, and try to get a lot out of it",130
wellman,5,A-,BMGT364,"This class is interesting with good lecture content mixed in with videos. All of the content of the course is fairly interesting. The exams require extensive preparation if you do not keep up. Some of the questions come out of the pictures that he posts on the slides, so study them also. Overall for grade distributions it comes out to a 3.3 which is 41% A 52% B rest C D or F. Definately recomended. ",130
wellman,5,A-,BMGT364,"Wellman is a great professor.  The course is interesting, lectures are entertaining, and you can tell he genuinely enjoys teaching.

The one problem I had with this class were the tests.  The multiple choice questions were very difficult - even on topics that I had studied over and over and knew very well, the questions were still difficult because of how they are designed and worded.  Almost all the questions had ""A and B"" or ""All of the Above"" answers which, in my opinion, just make the test ""tricky"" and don't do a good job of testing you on how well you understand the material.

Despite the problems I had with the tests, I would recommend taking this class with Wellman.  I still think I will get an A in the class because I attended all the lectures and discussions.  Also, don't worry too much about the Iliad or Everest assignments.  They are both a good amount of work, but not tough to score well on.  Take Iliad seriously, the results are helpful.
",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"Great professor.  Teaches using lots of videos.  Take lots of notes on lecture, you don't really need to read the book. I recommend bringing a laptop to class so you can keep up with notes.  The illiad assignment is really cool because it shows you your strengths and weaknesses.  Make sure you go to class every day to get your 4 points.  If you go to every class he will give you some extra credit at the end of the semester.  Very interesting class.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"Professor Wellman is an amazing teacher. Here is my advice for the class:
1) Go to class, he gives points for attending, and he shows a lot of videos, 90% of which are pretty interesting. 
2) Don't worry too much about taking notes, he posts the lectures after class.
3) Read the articles he gives you. They compile a good part of the tests. 
4) Don't worry about the Illiad. Dress up, do your best, and attend the right meetings. Even if you do bad in the meetings/memos, you will get good grade for the assignment.
Overall Wellman is great. I wish all classes were as interesting as his. ",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"GO TO CLASS! The in-class assignments(basically attendance)are about 25% of your grade. NEVER sign in for your friends, he tracks your handwriting and signature lol and you'll get in major trouble. Has a group type of project and an assessment of your managerial skills which sucks. 2 exams(50% of total grade) , mc and essays, do read the articles, the exam is prolly 70% based on them. The good thing is that if you average B on the exams, you get an A in the class. Final is optional if you missed less than 3 classes. Class is ok actually, lots of videos, pretty interesting at times. I learned a lot about real companies not just boring manag theory.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"I didn't like him at first, but by the end of the semester I really did enjoy his class.
Don't be fooled by the 2-hour discussion, you never have to go to a 2-hour discussion the entire semester. Rather there are three project: challenge course, everest ,and iliad, that you have to do outside of lecture time and those count for the hours you would have spent in discussion instead.
The class is pretty straightforward. You go to lecture take notes on the videos, so the in class assignment, and you'll be set for the exam. He puts up all his slides, articles, and video transcripts on blackboard so studying for the exam is that much easier.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"Fun and engaging course. I was dreading taking a course in 'management and organization' because it sounded boring and mind-numbing but Wellman is an alright guy. As long as you go to class and, as the other reviews suggest, take religious notes on the cool videos (most taken from YouTube) like one on the pornography industry and one on Whole Foods you'll do fine. 

Anticipate his test questions and don't try to copy down the slides during class (he doesn't post them before class but does afterward). Don't expect to ace the exams (pulled an 88 on the first one and am happy) but there are many other assignments offered.

Discussion sections are almost never held because of fun activities (like climbing the ropes course and doing a simulation of an Everest climb). The Iliad assessment is not really fun but the class itself is engaging and completely grounded in the actual business world outside the walls of the Smith School. ",130
wellman,4,A,BMGT364,"This was one of the better business classes I have taken.  I actually wanted to attend every class because I learned so much.  I really enjoyed watching almost daily videos learning how other companies choose to manage their employees. I must emphasize again, I really learned alot and would highly recommend taking this class.

Tests are very challenging, but the system is set up that one can get an A if you attend all the classes and do the easy assignments...even if you get low b's on the tests.",130
wellman,4,A,BMGT364,"He is a very nice, willing to listen to students, and doesnt say ""no"" to much. Lectures were mostly of ppt slides and video clips. TAs from Navy are great! Attend all lectures and discussions, points do add up! You dont have to take the final exam, get a B in both exams and do well in the activities he planned (Mt. Everest simulation & Iliad Assessment Center Activity (its 3 hrs long & $40!) ",130
wellman,5,,BMGT364,"This class was one of the best experiences of my life, though I wished that I had taken advantage of the resources there.  If it's hard for you to attend class, I have one thing to say to you:

MAKE AN EFFORT TO ATTEND EACH CLASS

The points add up and though you may miss one and think you're okay, you'll get a C (from experience) just off of classroom points.  SO GO!",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT364,"I haven't taken many business courses, but I liked Wellman's class a lot. In order to help you understand the material better, he provides interesting articles and case studies to read and keeps lecture interesting by showing videos in class. Studying for tests was easy with the slides he posted online, though the tests were challenging. This class actually teaches you stuff that you could use in real life.",130
wellman,5,a-,BMGT364N,"Class is made interesting by relating the text material to real life experiences and cases. Be sure to pay attention and take detailed notes on the videos because his tests can be very detailed oriented. Overall, informative class, and fair workload.  ",130
wellman,5,,BMGT364,"Truly a fantastic lecturer. Used lots case studies. Drew on his own experience as a Smith School administrator, providing insightful and often funny anecdotes. Outside work consisted almost entirely of reading the text and case studies. Exams are pretty fair, mixed multiple choice and short essays",130
wellman,5,a,BMGT364,"Professor Wellman was an awesome instructor. I took 364 over winter and he made it a lot of fun. At first the 4 hour classes were rough, but he made it bearable by mixing up the class with movies, group work, Iliad assessment, lecture and a simulation. If you attend class and read the chapters, you'll be fine for the exams. ",130
wellman,2,A,BMGT364,"Great person and interesting topics and readings.  Incredible procrastinator, and will take forever to respond to emails if at all.  Plays too many videos and doesn't do enough instruction and lecture.  Also, is terribly inconsistent standards of grading.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT110S,"Great guy, really nice and wants to give scholars kids good grades. videos in every class-60 minutes or some type of case study type news broadcast. hes laid back and buys pizza for cambridge before exams for a ""study snack"". an overall enjoyable class.",130
wellman,1,A+,BMGT289B,"This guy's BSE Scholars class is a complete joke. He makes no contribution to class and does not teach actual material.  The midterm is strict memorization from books and this was the most useless class I've ever taken in my life. He tries to rank students and the bottom 20% sits in the front as a form of humiliation. Terrible professor, highly do NOT recommend Wellman. ",130
wellman,5,A+,BMGT289B,"This was definitely a hard class, but I think it could be one of the most important ones you take in your college career. Some of the assignments are strange such as having to go to DC or partake in design thinking sessions, but if you have the right attitude for these kinds of activities, you will learn a lot of valuable skills that you can apply anywhere. I currently do CS research at UMD partially because I was told to try something crazy as a part of this course. Whenever I start a new project, I think back to this class and try to think about any way I can make my user's life easier. There are a lot of readings for this class, but it has taught me skills such as ""always showing up to a meeting with a prototype"" that allow me to stand out wherever I go. Mark Wellman will really work with you if you have some kind of idea or need assistance with something. He took my entire class to go see a Cirque du Soleil show for free and even wrote my recommendation letter. Remarkable professor.",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT466,"I took Wellman's class in Fall of 2018 and can say without a doubt that is shaped my career choice, when I graduated that December, for the better. Wellman focuses on bringing relevant, well-connected speakers to the classroom. If taken seriously, the speakers (and the information they share) can be priceless connections. I have used examples from these speakers during critical interviews and have used the business assessment we took to demonstrate to my current company my ability to perform under high stress situations. I highly, highly advise taking this course!",130
wellman,5,A,BMGT289B,BMGT-289b is the best class at UMD.  The course is challenging and you will need to manage your time effectively to complete assignments during the semester. Dr. Mark Wellman is the premier professor at UMD and his teaching style brings out the best in engaged students. The course covers a wide range of material and you will get out what you put in.  BMGT-289b promotes individual reflection and growth as you learn best practices from some of the best innovators our world has ever seen. A couple of my favorite memories from the course were the unit on design thinking and the Iliad Assessment exercise. I highly recommend BMGT-289b to all students at UMD. ,130
wellman,4,A,BMGT289J,"Dr. Wellman is a caring professor who wants his students to succeed. That said, he gives a lot of work to help his students learn as much as possible, and this can become a bit repetitive at times in my opinion. The class itself is a study of leadership and good leadership practices, and the many simulations we completed allowed the application of material that we learned. It is one of the first semester classes for the BSE Scholars program, and were I not in the program I wouldn't have taken the class, but I am glad that I did for the experience.",130
wellman,1,A,BMGT289B,"THIS IS THE WORST CLASS OFFERED AT UMD. Professor Wellman is so unorganized and clearly makes up random assignments 2 minutes before class. He gives so many busy work assignments that take so long to complete. You have to attend 7 outside events which is nearly impossible to do since he only offers around 10, and all of them are around 6 pm on Mondays or Thursdays. The end of the year assignment is a 13 page SINGLE SPACED paper talking about what you learned in this class, which was nearly impossible to do since we learned nothing of substance. He also grades things so aggressively and has no right doing so. Do not take this class if you want to enjoy school.",130

I would recommend taking him if he has any open seats.",131
bono,5,A-,BMGT302,Great guy & great class. Takes time with students and only moves on if everyone gets the content. Don't be afraid to ask him questions or tell him to take it slow!,131
bono,1,B,BMGT402,"No compassion for students, very cold personality. Lots of work for the class, a lab and HW are due on Friday and Sunday at 8 PM, respectively. Each take a couple hours of effort. Teaching style was terrible; makes life difficult by not giving examples of practice questions in slide lectures and gives unannounced clicker quizzes. No practice exams, hides all averages for assignments, and is very nitpicky with his grading. ",131
bono,5,A,BMGT302,Amazing professor. Spent a lot of time answering questions and helped me out with career advice outside class. Highly recommend him.,131
bono,5,A,BMGT404,Great class/professor if you want to learn the fundamentals of python. You will have to work for your grade,131
bono,5,A,BMGT402,I loved professor's teaching style. He was able to break up the different topics some of which were pretty dry and make them feel relevant and important. The hands-on SQL work we did in the second half was the most beneficial and seems applicable to work after graduation.,131

finch,2,,BMGT321,"This guys reviews are surprisingly positive, I had him 2 semesters ago and he is literally the worst professor I have ever had at Smith.

He seems like a nice person, but he kinda sucks at teaching. He didn't use power points of any kind. He pretty  much just stood up there and lectured. His exams were tough. He did give partial credit for stuff, so that was kinda nice.

If you don't mind teaching yourself by reading the text, by all means go ahead and take his class. Just keep in mind that you are paying for this whole college education thing, so if you wanna get your money's worth, take this class with literally anyone else. ",133
finch,4,A,BMGT313F,"Finch is a nice and entertaining guy and a good professor, who doesn't waste time teaching you irrelevant stuff. However, he is by no means an easy professor, like others have mentioned. If you want to do well, you need to put in the effort, or else you'll do badly. For this class, we had 5 quizzes, one cumulative final, and a valuation project. They are not overly difficult, but you need to study well for them. The project itself wasn't hard. It was mainly just going through a company's 10K and calculating some ratios and answering questions, but ended up being very time consuming. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, more than 321, which I also took with him. If you put in the effort, the class won't be too hard, and you'll get a good grade. ",133
finch,4,A,BMGT321,"Prof. Finch is a really good professor, who knows his stuff, but he isn't by any means easy. You really have to put in the effort to do well in his class. There are 3 exams, which can be difficult, as compared to what is done in class, so you really need to know your stuff. Also, a note... don't forget to write down and label everything on the exam, or you might get a surprise in the end, because he will take off points if you forget. If you really want to learn and are willing to put in the effort, I highly suggest that you take him. If not, I highly suggest that you look for a different professor.",133
finch,3,A,BMGT313,"Finch is an interesting guy. His personality is great, and is always entertaining. His class is certainly not boring. Too often though he is extremely laid back and tends to waste a great deal of class time. He is also a very stringent grader, and takes off points for very minor things.

I definitely learned a good amount in his class, but only because I put in the effort. Most of the students rarely did the readings, and his class was often slowed down by that. Still, I can recommend him just based on his personality, and the fact that he made the material somewhat interesting. I would probably rather have taken it with another professor, but I can't say I hated this course either.",133
finch,4,C,BMGT311,"This was definitely the hardest class I've taken at the business school. The course material was pretty dry and Professor Finch's teaching style wasn't really effective for me personally. But I think he was a good teacher and he was very willing to give help outside of class and spend a lot of time explaining things I didn't understand. It's not the most fun class, so be prepared to put in a lot of work, but in the end it's worth it and Finch can give a lot of help if you ask for it.",133
finch,4,B,BMGT311,"This is a complicated review. 
I took Finch in Spring 2013. He was the hardest professor I've ever had at UMD, and I've never worked harder for a single class, nor been happier with the B I earned. It was not easy.
But the thing is, I've never learned more in any class at UMD. Finch forces you to learn the material, because you cannot do well in the class unless you do. And it's not just out-of-class learning (though you do have to read the textbook on your own); Finch spends a lot of time in class going through problems similar to those you'll see on the tests (and, more importantly, on the CPA). He makes sure you really know what he's doing, and takes questions better than anyone else I've ever seen. 
The trick with him is to actually do the readings in advance, and actually participate in lectures. If you do, you'll learn more than in any other class at UMD. 
If this doesn't sound like something you want, you should probably take a different professor. ",133
finch,3,A-,BMGT321,"He is an alright professor. You basically have to teach yourself in this class by reading and doing the homework. The homework isn't checked or anything, but since he doesn't lecture in class, just goes over homework problems that anyone has, you should probably attempt the homework. 
This class also goes pretty fast, we covered a chapter a class, so halfway through the semester people would just stop doing the homework because they didn't have time to read and do all the homework. 
If you want a good grade you really have to make this class a priority. 
Also he doesn't check his email, he doesn't put grades up on elms, and it's 1 day before the deadline to submit final grades on Testudo and he still hasn't uploaded anything.
All in all, he's a nice guy, but I wouldn't recommend taking him. 
",133
finch,5,A,BMGT311,"I took Finch in the Spring of 2011. Professor Finch is a GREAT professor. Don't let these other reviews fool you. Of course he has high expectations for students and his exams are challenging. And I think that is how it ought to be. You are paying a tuition to learn not to just get an A. Finch forces you to learn the material.

Your responsibility as a student is to DO THE READING. Your Intermediate book is NOT a decorative element. It is meant to be read. When I mean read, I mean read EVERY page not skim through it. And do the homework problems he assigns even though he doesn't grade them or check it. Hold yourself accountable to getting an education you paid for.

He can't possibly cover EVERYTHING in the book during lecture so it helps if you've read the material beforehand and done some of the problems. That way, you can have questions as he is explaining the material... not just sit there gazing into space.  

People complain about his exams being too hard and undoable. I don't think they were. They were challenging but the exams are doable. It is possible to do well on them. I did well on them. When the average was a 50. I was getting an 88. If I could do it, you can to. Just work hard, believe and hope in God!

If you take Finch and you are prepared to buckle down, discipline yourself and read that book, you will be very glad you did. You will discover Accounting to be much more interesting than you could have possibly ever imagined and you will leave that class learning so much.  And you will get an A. That A will be the best A you've ever gotten and you will be proud of your accomplishment. It is a great feeling! ",133
finch,1,A,BMGT321,"Honestly this was one of the hardest classes I took at the B school. Finch is a nightmare. He doesn't teach the material properly and goes off tangents on movies. His exams are extremely hard because he doesn't teach anything, so this course is basically a teach it yourself one. He takes forever to grade material. Honestly avoid Finch at all cost, unless you want to struggle to get your A. The only good thing I see out of this course is that his class really nit picks out the destined accountants. ",133
finch,1,B-,BMGT321,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
This guy does not actually teach the material but assumes students have read the chapter before hand and does a few 20 minute long problems in class which thoroughly confused the class because we didn't read/teach ourselves the chapters. Tests were miserable, exam 1 average was 65 and exam 2 average was 47. No one in the class finished the exam and pages were left blank. The final exam was just as hard. Final grades have not yet been posted, but he keeps saying there will be no curve which I just don't see to be possible. WAY harder than 310 and 311, literally take any other professor. Finch is actually a really great guy and is hilarious, but is an awful/hard teacher.",133
finch,5,B,BMGT221H,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE REVIEW BELOW. Finch is a great professor, one who doesn't bore your with stupid power points and who doesn't put you to sleep in class. To most people, including myself, financial statements and ledgers and what not are not fun, but the way Finch explains things make the stuff seem so ""obvious"". You will learn more from his class than you realize. 

His midterms were fair. If you attend class (he doesn't post anything online) and do all the suggested homework (or just listen in class when he goes over them), no one should do poorly. If you don't know how to study, that's another problem entirely. 

Finch's lectures generally consistent of going over the chapter for half a class, ask students for homework questions, and a lot of random facts in between about random movies that no one has ever seen before. For our final, the extra credit is a question about What About Bob. 

The only downside is that our final was ridiculously hard, but he warned us it would be so because our class averages were too high. Which I still don't understand why it's a bad thing...

Take the class with him if you can!",133
finch,2,A,BMGT311,"Oh Mike Finch. He truly didn't care about making sure his students were comfortable with material. He got mad when we didn't read chapter beforehand, so he punished us by only half teaching the subject. His exams were hardest ones I've ever taken. The averages were horrible, and insisted that he was not going to curve course (even though in end he did). This was a complete nightmare of a class, and a whole ton more stressful than 310. For sure take with different Professor.",133

The exams are very challenging but you really get a lot of of his class. If you really want to learn accounting, take classes with Finch. Again, not the easiest professor but great learning experience!",133
finch,5,A,BMGT321,"A very good lecturer (probably the best I've had in my accounting classes). If you're looking for a class you can go and just look at the internet because the powerpoints are online he is not the guy for you. He really teaches students, writing on the board rather than using power points given to him by the textbook. Does not check homework, but bases class off questions from the homework so it is a good idea to come in with some questions.

You will usually get out off class about 15 minutes early because he makes very effective use of class time. The tests are challenging and he has said that he does not curve. He is a HUGE movie buff and likes to quote movies in class. Also tells some funny stories.

Really tough to get an A in his class, but you will walk away feeling as though you have learned something. A really great professor, but not an easy class.",133
finch,4,D,BMGT321,Challenging professor and solid lecturer. Will weed out those who are destined not to be accountants (like myself). ,133
finch,2,B,BMGT321,The entire grade for the class was based on 3 exams and an arbitrary 10% participation grade. The exams were much tougher than the practice homework problems or what was taught in class. The material was pretty dry and so were the lectures. I personally don't know of anyone who received an A in this class. I would STRONGLY suggest taking this class with a different professor.,133
finch,2,,BMGT321,"I understand that he wants to challenge students to really think about the material, but when you got 90% of the class lined up during the final to ask questions, there's a good chance you're overdoing it. He takes off points for labels and other small details which can really impact your exam score. He would say certain types of questions were on the exam, then come exam time only a couple of those would be on there. These questions were 2x harder than in-class examples.",133
finch,1,C+,BMGT321,"I would advise anyone reading this to take this course elsewhere if you can. Finch is a hard-ass and does nothing to make the class nor the content easier to understand. He gives out hw assignments which take many hours to complete. Since they are graded for completion by the grad TA, you do not know if you even did it correctly. He only uses a chalkboard in class, no powerpoints whatsoever. His exams are ludicrous; the problems are so much harder than the ones practiced in class. In fact, every exam we had a line of students waiting to ask him to clarify questions, but he did a shit job of helping us out. We consistently went over the allotted time for the exams only to delay the following section from taking theirs and so on and so forth. 

Don't stick around hoping that things get better in this class, because they don't.",133
rust,2,A,BMGT457,"I'm not quite sure why he is forced to teach undergrad marketing capstone. It is evident from the first day that he is a grad school professor interested in marketing research. A course better suited for him to teach undergrads may be 452.

The b-school having Rust teach 457 is basically a way to boost his ego. All of his lectures are basically about research he has done for the university. He is clearly a very smart and highly regarded researcher but the entire class is basically about him. The course is structured as 1 day lecture, 1 day group presentations so work is pretty minimal.",134

perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,"Perfetti is great professor, with tons of knowledge and experience. However, in order to enjoy this course, you really need to enjoy finance. If you do, this will be one of the best classes you'll ever take!!! The material covered is this course is very really world, interest, and very useful, even for other classes. You'll also learn some high-level Excel modeling and how to use Bloomberg. There are a lot of assignments, some individual, some in group, but there are not very hard, and the grading is pretty lenient. The exams are also all take-home, and done online. Overall, this was one of the best classes I ever took, and an A is very easily attainable. I highly recommend this class to everyone!!!",136
perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,"Let me preface this by saying that you need to really enjoy finance to appreciate Perfetti and this course. I can say that this was the one of the best classes I've taken in the business school. Perfetti is a great lecturer and does a great job of simplifying complex material, and making it interesting. I learned a ton, which sadly I can't say for many of my other courses.

This class did require a good amount of work, but everything I got out of it was worth it. Also grading is fairly lenient.",136
perfetti,3,B,BMGT443,"This was an okay class, if you like the material and you enjoy the ""finance personality."" A lot of the class is spent listening to Professor Perfetti emphasize how smart he is, and how important it is to be smart like him. 
I went to about half the classes, and usually showed up late. In spite of that, I would have gotten an A but my group was dinged 6 points for failing to submit a spreadsheet with our final paper. The exams were both take-home and all of the homeworks are pretty much the same and exactly what we did in class; in order to do badly, you have to really try (as I did). 
So, again, if you enjoy stock stuff, think valuation is interesting, want to learn some high-level Excel modeling, or just really enjoy being in a room full of Finance people, take this class.
If none of these apply to you (and besides the Excel practice, none of them applied to me), I suggest finding a different Finance elective. ",136
perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,"Professor Perfetti is one of the best Finance professors in the business school. He is extremely knowledgeable in the subject matter and does a great job of presenting the material in an easy-to-understand manner. His classes are very practical and give you great experience in valuing real-world companies using a valuation model that you create in class.

The class is pretty easy to get an A in as long as you do all of the work that is assigned to you. The midterm threw some people off as it was slightly more difficult than many were probably expecting, but it was pretty fair if you took the time to read the multiple choice questions carefully. The homework assignments are all easy, and Professor Perfetti provides videos on how to do all of the homework assignments properly. The group valuation project just gives you experience valuing a real-world company in a group setting using the valuation model that you construct in Excel, while the StockTrak assignment is really a hit or miss. The final exam is take-home and is also pretty easy.

Overall, this is probably the most practical Finance class offered in the business school as it gives you great experience in valuing real-world companies using McKinsey's economic format and DCF. If possible, try to take this class with Perfetti.",136
perfetti,5,,BMGT443,Perfetti is one of the better professors I have had at UMD. He gets down to business and doesn't mess around or waste anyone's time. Don't leave the final group project until the last second or else it will be the bane of your existence if you try to balance it with finals.,136
perfetti,5,,BMGT443,"Perfetti is awesome. He really knows what he is talking about and knows how to explain everything to make it understandable to undergrads.

The course is about valuing companies and throughout the year you will go about building a model.

The course consists of attendance, homeworks, stock portfolio, a midterm, a final, and a final project. Everything is take home and open notes which makes it really easy. There is no excuse to not get an A in the class.

Attendance is pretty self-explanatory. The homeworks are relatively easy and for almost all of them, he posts videos that if you follow step by step you will do well on the homework. The midterm and  final are like longer homeworks with some multiple choice questions thrown in. They are relatively easy too since you have a lot of time to do them and they're open notes and open book. The other parts of the class are the stock portfolio and the final project which is an analysis and valuation of a company that you choose in an industry he chooses. The stock portfolio is hit or miss since it seems to be mostly luck. You're graded against your classmates in this. The final project is a complete analysis and valuation of a company and he tells you everything that needs to be included in it.

This class is very easy and interesting. Perfetti is one of the best professors in the business school and finance department by far.",136
perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,"Perfetti is THE man. Despite the fact that the teaches at UMD and Wharton while concurrently owning a management consulting firm, he still shows up to class in a polo, jeans, and sneakers.

The goal of this class is to teach you the DCF as viewed by consultants, as well as a few bits about multiples and economic profit valuations. Each lecture consists of you going over one small part of the valuation. 

Grades consist of periodic homework assignments, a midterm, a final, attendance, stocktrack performance (i.e. a stock portfolio), and final group project (a formal valuation of some company). All assignments, including exams, are take-home. He gives at least 2 points of extra credit during the semester. He grades leniently, and getting an A is very easy.

Perfetti really knows this subject in and out, and he drills important concepts into your head better than most professors. 

Probably the most important course for a finance major.",136
perfetti,4,B,BMGT443,"Good course, really teaches you something that matters.  I should have gotten the A in the class, but I missed 4 classes (each miss after the first takes 2 pts off your final grade).  Show up to all the classes and make sure to do the homeworks and keep up to date.

This is not a class you can teach yourself.  Go to class and pay attention, Perfetti will get you there.",136
perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,Best Finance course you probably ever take at Smith school. he knows what he's talking about.I felt like I am actually learning something.,136
perfetti,5,A,BMGT443,"Professor Perfetti has tons of industry experience and really know what he's talking about. His lecture is what I think, without a doubt, the best finance course in Smith, and I've learned from him a lot. However, he is very strict on assignment rules and he can be harsh in grading, given the fact that the course is very easy, and an overwhelming proportion of students got an ""A"" from his class. His rules on final exam opt out is truly awesome and make my life in finals week much easier. 

*However*, he admits that people “hate” him for that as well. Since some grading on cases and projects are just totally by LUCK. Yes, by luck! Apart from the Bloomberg challenge, there is a group case that asks you to pick two companies to outperform S&P500 in 2.5 months, otherwise you’re gonna to be deducted by 2.5 points. Our team missed both. Seriously if I can predict the future by this why I’m I even in this university? I should be sitting in JPMorgan or Morgan Stanley, or even writing a book to tell people which stock they should invest, and everybody who knows this will become rich. It is totally ridiculous. I would say be very careful in picking a team/selecting your teammates since unreliable teammates will result you unable to be opt out from the tedious final exam that will be potentially destroying your final grade.

This is a course you can really learn a lot about finance but you can also get end up with a bad grade easily if you have made some careless mistakes. But I still gotta say, Perfetti is a great lecturer and BMGT443 is a perfect course for those who are interested in finance, it will definitely exceed your expectations.",136
perfetti,4,A,BMGT443,"Perfetti is an extremely knowledge professor, but can be intimating to some students. He expects a lot from his students but not anything that is too complicated. Everything is outlined on the syllabus and if you don't follow it exactly you have the potential to get your grade lower or receive no credit on assignments. He teaches the Bloomberg software which is very confusing (but extremely useful) so listening to lecture really helps complete assignments and understand what is going on in the class. There is a lot of extra credit to make up from a bad grade on like 3 different assignments. Group project also account for 50% of your grade, so you should hope you get put in a good group were everyone does their fair share",136
pavlovsky,5,A,BMGT341,"Professor Pavlovsky is an excellent professor. She can come across as a little stern, but honestly it's completely warranted given that her courses are mostly for juniors and seniors who have lost interest in school. She really pushes you to learn and pay attention, which can be hard, but her exams take heavily from the lecture. Many times she'll say things in class that aren't on the slides, which she'll then write into the exam, so pay attention and take notes if you want an A. All-in-all, she's a fair grader and a nice person but definitely not a pushover. I would recommend taking her class, but you will have to work for that A. ",141
pavlovsky,4,B,BMGT341,"Every lecture is right off the slides, a lot of people stopped coming to class when they realized that. Not really any homework at all, just one stock presentation, and two exams, and participation, so your grade is based off of just those things. Exams really werent too bad if you went to class and studied.",141
pavlovsky,5,A,BMGT341,"Pavlovsky surely worked in Wall Street before and has vast industry experience in finance. But she talks way too fast and her lectures can be very hard to follow especially for those who are not familiar with financial markets. Also the best way to study this course by not going to class because her exam are all from the slides and there will be almost no difference by going to the class or not, you can learn everything about this course better by reading the slides. You can’t really learn anything extra from sitting in her lectures which what she did is basically reading the slides at 100km/h. A lot of people know this and they never show up unless they’re there for her market update or there’s a “pop” quiz – ironically that everybody knows there’s gonna be one so I don’t know why it has a “pop” before it. The first one is pretty easy but the last two are slightly harder, beware and try to attend as much class in the first half of the semester as possible to drop the final and the hardest quiz (The mean of the final two quizzes was 2.9/5 and 2.1/5! Means on average the class failed!).

Exams are not hard, but also not easy. In order to receive a good grade, you need to study her slides, especially some details in every topic. However, the overall grading is quite lenient compared to ECON330. 

Overall, I would still strongly recommend her class. You can learn something from this course and she is a fair grader. Some of my friends also benefited from her advice giving to them in internship searching. Your effort will truly be paid off if you studied hard and prepared well. ",141
pavlovsky,4,A-,BMGT341F,"Nice lady, fair grader. The class seems intimidating at first but it's actually super manageable as long as you show up to class. She talks fast but most of the exam was from her slides. No homework except the market update which is nice.",141
hallows,4,B,BMGT340,"Prof. Hallows makes this class interesting. Like many people already said, she's nice and in my opinion good for those who don't like math as she takes almost elementary approach and solves problems on the board step-by-step. This class required a lot of work however (video lectures, video quizzes, hw, chapter quizzes, project). Clickers are used in this class. Attendance wasn't taken. Tests are crazy difficult, it helps to go over the ones from past semesters which will be posted on ELMS for you. Only 3 out of 4 tests count so final is technically optional. There's also some extra credit.",143
hallows,5,A,BMGT340,"Professor Hallows is a really nice professor, who treats everybody with respect. She is a great lecturer, and wants to make sure everybody understands Finance. In class, she will work many problems for each chapter, which are similar to what is on the exams. Even though the exams are done among all the 340 teachers, I still found them to be quite accessible. The projects are not difficult, but require some time (there are 3 of them). It is also important that you do all the homework, quizzes, video quizzes, and the extra credit assignments, which can really help your grade. If you have the opportunity to take her, I highly recommend that you do!",143
hallows,3,B-,BMGT340,"This class is extremely difficult. I don't blame Dr. Hallows for the unfairness of this class because all of the finance professors work together to structure the class so it's not her fault how difficult it is. She does a decent enough job of presenting material and really does care about her students. The problem of this class lies on how hard the exams are. You can literally go over every practice exam, Myfinance lab quiz/HW and you will still see questions on the exams that literally no one in the class knows how to answer. Often the TA's will even struggle to solve them. I assume they do this to bring the averages of the exams down and its really unfair. The best way to study is to look through all of the practice exams and do problems over and over and over since those questions will best prepare you for the exams. 

The one plus of the class is how awesome the TA's are. Some of them are not too great at teaching material but some of them are really great and can teach you the concepts really well. They will even help you with the quizzes and project. Before exams, go to the TA's with any questions you have. They will help you out alot and let you know what to expect on the exams.",143
hallows,3,,BMGT340,"I was deciding between a three and a four. She is a nice lady who knows a lot about finance. I think her weak spot is in understanding questions from students and then explaining concepts. 

She's not the best teacher but she's also far from the worst",143
hallows,5,A,BMGT340,"Professor Hallows is a great teacher and will do whatever she can to make sure her students understand Finance. She is very patient and work the problems over and over. She always returned by emails usually in a couple of hours, and I wrote her quite frequently, let me tell you.

The exams are fair, I guess it depends on the subject. I got an A on the first, C on the second, and was able to get a B+ on the third and avoid the final. Make sure to do all homework and extra credit assignments; they will certainly help you out. The projects require some work, but are not so difficult. Watch the videos and you should be fine.",143
hallows,5,A,BMGT340,"Hallows is really nice and tries to do everything she can to help you understand finance. She will even fall a little behind because she does so many practice problems and tries to help you out for the exams. Overall, the course is run together among all of the 340 teachers, so the tests don't come from just her. I found them mildly tough. They curved a couple and presented you with a ton of extra credit opportunities. No real excuse to get under a B if you do them and homeworks.",143
hallows,5,A+,BMGT340,"Professor Hallows is a solid lecturer and really tries to help students grasp the concepts presented in corporate finance. She often goes out of her way to bring real-world examples into the lecture, which is good for students interested in finance. The difficulty of the exams is not really up to her, but she is open to answer any questions that you may have.",143
hallows,4,B,BMGT340,"Hallows is a tough lady who doesn't sugar coat how hard finance is, which I appreciated. However, she is a nice person who treats all of her students with respect. She goes over questions anyone has about the subject clearly, and will continue to explain until you get the concept. I never felt lost in her class because of her teaching style. 
My advice for 340 is definitely do all of the extra credit. It's not that hard but it absolutely saved my grade this semester. ",143
hallows,1,B-,BMGT340,"Her first name describes her demeanor. She gets frustrated when you do not know the content as well as her, and flies through concepts. She knows the content well, and there are a lot of resources to do well, however, I would feel stressed and sad in her class. For teaching, I would say a rating of 2-3  is more appropriate but I have never dreaded going to a class as much as 340. Her attitude is just that bad and draining.",143
hallows,1,A,BMGT340,"Unaccommodating, rude, sociopathic piece of sh*t. Didn't even consider decreasing workload; felt like a lot of class concepts weren't that bad but the busywork/HW was insane on top of projects.

I went to his office hours and he patiently took the time to discuss difficult topics with me. He really wants his students to succeed! Yes, he has an accent, but so do tons of professors...it never bothered me or affected my learning. 

Overall, Prof Ruhi is great!! Take his classes, go to them, do your assignments, and ask for help when you need it. He will work with you so that you do well. ",145
ruhi,1,A-,BMGT385,"Where to begin with Kazim Ruhi..

Personality: Can be nice and welcoming at times but other times is completely rude and uncaring towards students. He doesn't care much for his students and he often comes off as someone who thinks he's better than all of his students(which may be true academic wise but a good professor never looks down on students). 

Teaching Style: Possibly the worst teacher I've had in all of my academic life. He doesn't know how to present concepts and most students sit in his class bored or are on their phones because he isn't interesting. He teaches way too heavily from the book and all of his powerpoints are made from the book publisher. He literally just has the book memorized and repeats the book material during lecture. If you are one of those students that can read the book and learn the material than you probably won't care. But if your someone like me that needs relevant examples of qualitative and quantitative problems, then don't take this guy. 

Lastly, His accent: The issue isn't necessarily with his accent but more due to his broken English. He doesn't know how to structure sentences properly and his vocabulary isn't very good. This often leaves him stumbling over his words and confusing students even more. The worst part is when he is going over quantitative problems. You can never follow him because he goes too fast and no one can understand what hes saying. This class is pretty much a math class so you have to understand the quantitative aspects to do well on the exams. 

PS. I'm not a bitter student that never attended class and is writing a bad review. I attended every single class and passed with a good grade at the end because I had to put in long hours of studying to understand the material. If you want a ""teacher"", don't take him. If your alright with reading the book and learning, it won't matter if you take him or not. 
",145
ruhi,4,A,BMGT230,"Solid teacher; not nearly as bad as some people make him out to be. His accent is not so difficult to understand and can make the class funny at times.
Professor Ruhi seems to care about his students. He holds a lot of office hours and, while he won't bend over backwards for his students, he does genuinely want them to succeed and will help them if necessary.
I found his lectures to be boring but if you stay focused on the material they actually help quite a bit.
Overall, Professor Ruhi is a good teacher. I would recommend taking his class for B Stat.",145
ruhi,2,B,BMGT385,"The other reviewers saying that he is not a very good teacher are correct. He is not the most effective teacher. The examples he gives to help you understand are right out of the book. He uses the textbook slides but really just loosely covers them. To make this worse, he is hard to understand at times. What is good however, is that he and the TA will help you significantly with the homeworks, even verifying your answers. I go to class, but half of the students don't. He's not terrible, but if there's a better option, take it. ",145
ruhi,2,A,BMGT230H,"This class was not very difficult at all, but I have already taken stat before. Many other students with no stat background were lost and Ruhi was of little help.

Spent a good deal of class advocating for other classes he teaches in the business school.",145
ruhi,4,C+,BMGT230H,"Great professor. Very funny (usually not on purpose), knows what he's talking about, gives lots of examples, and answers all of your questions. I suck at statistics, but he made the course bearable. His accent wasn't a problem. If anything, it made the class more fun",145
ruhi,1,B,BMGT332,"Honestly I took this class because I heard it was a pretty easy Supply Chain upper level class.  The material is pretty simple but Ruhi is a horrendous professor. Potentially the worst I've ever had at Maryland.  He is a stubborn prick who does not make his own powerpoints, instead teaching directly out of the book.  He takes lots of points off both tests and homeworks for little reason at all.  He said that if we had a 175/200 combined on the first two tests we should be good to get A's.  I had a 174.5 and then got a 94 on the final and got a B in the class.  When I asked him about this he stated that he never said this and yelled at me for implying he was a liar.  Absolute dickhead, DO NO TAKE THIS GUY FOR THIS CLASS.",145
ruhi,2,A,BMGT385,"Ruhi's a nice guy but he's a bad teacher, and this class has some pretty complex material. Most of the issue is due to his broken English.

I have him for two classes this semester...don't do this to yourself! He does have an accent, but that's not the problem. He's just not a good teacher. 

His quizzes and exams are difficult...expect to spend a LOT of time outside of class studying and teaching yourself the material if you want to do well!",145
ruhi,1,C,BMGT385,"Awful. 
I am a hardworking student who generally does really well (I'm graduating early with a 3.7 GPA), so trust me when I tell you not to take any classes with him. 
He is NOT an effective educator. He does NOT explain the concepts well, and they are just confusing and overwhelming - and then on the exams, you have no idea what to do because you never understood the concepts in the first place.
I think he's a nice guy who tries, but he does not relay the information well. And if you go to talk to him about it, he's stuck in his ways and won't budge!
Just Terrible... I am counting down the days (literally) until this class ends.",145
ruhi,3,C,BMGT332,"The material in this class is so easy it's ridiculous.  You can study this material and think you mastered it, take the exam and get a C. Professor Ruhi takes off points for the most unnecessary things. It's basic math, but somehow you will find yourself with 15 points taken off your grade for silly mistakes. Ruhi is a nice guy though, fairly pleasant, but his grading is unfair. Also this is one of this classes you can't miss. If you miss one class your screwed because we cover so much in one class.",145
ruhi,5,A,BMGT230H,"Professor Ruhi is absolutely AMAZING. Who gives a #*%# about his accent? Its so immature to blame the fact that English is his second language for poor grades.

ruhi,4,,BMGT332,"Wow, Professor Ruhi is great. His quizzes and exams can be difficult. The key is to go to class. He may go a bit fast, but all the information he goes over will be on the quizzes and exams. If you don't go to class, there is a lot of information in the text that won't be covered in the exams, and you'll have no idea what will be covered. Don't miss a class. Do the HW and put in work and you should be fine. ",145

I would give him no stars if I could. ",145
ruhi,5,A,BMGT230H,"Alright, before I say anything about this professor, I want everyone to know that I took this class with him during the summer session which is slightly different than taking it during Fall/Spring.

This was the first stats course in my life and I was nervous about it coming into this class. But, this professor is the best Smith school can offer you for this course. He is ridiculously generous and wants everyone in his class to get good grades. He does plenty of examples in class which is an excellent practice for the exams. He also tells the students what electives they should take in the future so they can easily get hired and with a better salary. Tests are fair with little or no trick questions at all. He does have a pretty thick accent but it really isn't a problem. His excellent teaching skills and sense of humor makes up for it. And honestly, if you really want to learn the material then his accent shouldn't be a problem at all.

For the summer class, this was the grade breakdown (Remember it might be different for Fall/Spring semester)

. Test 1 (22.5%)
. Test 2 (22.5%)
. Test 3 (22.5%)
. Test 4 (22.5%)
. Participation (10%)

But if you're serious about learning the material and doing well in the class, you learn to get used to it.  He's a great guy; really cares about how his students do and what we will take and use from the class in the real world.  Uses plenty of examples, and his tests are pretty straightforward.  His projects teaches us how to use software like Minitab and Excel.",145
ruhi,5,A,BMGT230,I enjoyed this class. Took it with Ruhi during winter because Pr.Gold failed to succeed teaching 230 in fall.(Read the reviews for Gold ).

ruhi,1,,BMGT230H,He is a nice guy but he's a horrible teacher. His english is very very very very hard to understand. I was doing really horribly in his class because I refuse to teach myself such an easy subject. Dropped his class and took Studer-Ellis (who unfortunately left) and had over a 100%. I do hear Ruhi curves to make up for his poor teaching (as his GPA distribution suggests) but I couldn't stand taking a class like that.,145
ruhi,5,A,BMGT230H,The first thing you'll notice about Prof Ruhi is his accent. That does get in the way at times but he is a very thorough teacher. He wants his students to do well and does plenty of examples to ensure that you understand the material. He's very approachable if you have a problem. I've heard great things about Studer-Ellis but I think getting the H (only extra work is 3 easy projects) on the end of the course by taking it with Ruhi was worth it.,145
ruhi,1,,BMGT230H,"Avoid taking class with him if you can, especially BMGT230H.  You can take BMGT230 with Studer-Ellis who is an incredible teacher, especially compared to Ruhi.  Ruhi does not know how to get his point across, which is usually not a good thing when you are teaching a class.  Meeting with him outside of class is pointless because he has the same attitude all the time - he doesn't care about his students at all.  I took BMGT230H and learned almost nothing.  I dropped the class and took it with Studer-Ellis and got an A+.  Ruhi is terrible.
",145
ruhi,4,B+,BMGT230H,"Professor Ruhi is very nice, and really wants you to learn, but language is definitely a barrier, e.g. he says proBOBlity instead of probability, which throws you off. If you take the time to work through extra problems and practice, you'll be fine. The only reason I got a B was because I was really sick the week before one of the exams, and didn't study for it. So, be healthy, do the work, ask him questions when you need to, and you'll be set. ",145
ruhi,3,,BMGT230H,"He definitely knows the subject extremely well, but also is pretty tough          on his students.

Professor Ruhi is a VERY VERY knowledgeable professor. He really wants his students to do well. He is well accessible for help with assignment, test questions, anything. Only assignments: weekly quizes, only 2-3 projects, and 4 tests.

Cons:
He is WAY TOO demanding. English is EXTREEMLY broken resulting in constantly not understanding his lectures & sheer boredom in class. 
Assinments: WEEKLY quizes, long projects, difficult tests.

Maybe he was so much 'extra' because this was an Honors Version course.... but regardless....BE CAUTIOUS ",145
ruhi,5,A-,BMGT435,"Dr. Ruhi is a VERY helpful teacher.  He wants all of his students to do well and if you put in the time you should be able to earn an A in this class.  However, I want to warn anyone who is thinking about taking this class, it is VERY demanding.  In order to understand MANY of your assignments you will have to go get help from the TA or Dr. Ruhi.  If you are not comfortable with going to get help MULTIPLE times throughout the semester, I would not recommend taking this course. 

Also... make sure you have your own laptop (WINDOWS) with Microsoft Excel 2003 installed.  This is essential for the course.

If you don't have a laptop you will have to get a laptop from OIT, which will be a major pain in the butt!",145
mostow,1,,BMGT323,"Do not take this class with this professor- Leslie Mostow. He doesn't teach anything. TA does most of the work. TA made up questions for midterms and final. TA graded exams and submitted grades. TA prepare tax project. TA worked out problems in class. TA answered emails and discussion. The professor was pretty much let TA do whatever in class. Even though the professor lectured but TA gave exams so things were like: teach A, test B... didn't work out for students. We (me and other classmates) dont even know what the professor do in the class. He does not teach anything, You are on your own 99% of the time.
Almost forget to mention, the 1st midterm was given during the 2nd week of the semester, so be prepare to fail if you want this kind of challenge!",149
mostow,5,A+,BMGT323,"Professor Mostow is a pretty funny and interesting guy. The material is not by any means easy, but the class is structured well enough that you can learn a lot and do well. You have homework on Connect practically every week and in the end there is a tax project, which is very good to put into practice what you've learned. He grades the project pretty leniently. The exams (4) are not easy, but not overly difficult, and he'll be sure to tell you in advance what's going to be on it during the review sessions right before the exam. In class, he basically just reads of the power points and does some exercises, so it's not the most interesting thing, but it's still useful to attend. Overall, I really enjoyed taking this class with this professor, and I think you will also if you decide to take it.",149
mostow,4,A+,BMGT323,"Professor Mostow was a pretty funny and interesting teacher, although the class material was a bit dry. The class was really structured, with homework every week, so if you studied on your own you might not have to pay that much attention in class. I would definitely pay attention during the class period right before the exams because he pretty much goes through the exam questions and tells you what topics to study. He also gave a lot of opportunities for extra credit and graded the final project very, very leniently. Overall, he wasn't an overly difficult professor, and he made the class interesting and pretty easy to do well in.",149
mostow,3,A+,BMGT323,"I have had Professor Mostow for two different courses (BMGT323 and BMGT310), and his teaching style was very similar for both courses. He typically reads off of the PowerPoint presentations that are provided to him by the book publisher in one lecture, and does practice problems in the next lecture. He does not like to use the board to explain problems, but is friendly in trying to help students with any questions.

I did not like his teaching style, but if you read the book and do the homework, you should be fine. His review sessions before the exams go over exactly what you need to know, so make sure you go to reviews. If the class did not have any points awarded for attendance, I would have only showed up for the review sessions.

Overall, it is clear that he is extremely knowledgeable in the field of accounting, but I felt that he was not particularly good in conveying his knowledge to the class effectively. If you are able to learn from the book, you will do fine in his class. If not, I would suggest taking this class with another professor.",149
mostow,4,A,BMGT310,"Class is really hard not going to lie. Accounting is a hard subject so you can't really blame this guy. He tries his best in teaching the subject, but its better you don't attend his lectures because he reads off powerpoints. If you want to learn accounting you have to read the book otherwise find a different professor.",149
mostow,5,A,BMGT323,"Professor is the best teacher I ever met!!! Very funny guy and we end up being very good friend!

Let's put aside all the other good things about him, just one thing you need to know about his class:

Make sure you go to the class right before midterms and the final, then you will get something.... that is extremely useful for your exams!

Haha, just go to the review class before his exams, you will know what I mean!


Take his class!!!!!",149
mostow,2,A-,BMGT310,"If you thought Pfieffer was bad, then wait till you get this guy. Just the same boring guy as Pfieffer, only his tests are completely different from any of the homework or practice problems. ",149
mostow,4,A,BMGT311,"Honestly, you have to read and attempt to understand the material before you arrive to class. If you do, you will find his lecture actually helpful. Being the second semester taking Mostow, i do see going to class useful. He is very knowledgeable, maybe not the best professor but he does know what he's talking about. If you have a question, the best option is to approach him personally. His test are parallel to the material, they are hard but if you're going for the CPA then you'd be prepared. The homework takes a long time to do but if you do them before he finishes lecturing a chapter then its easier to get the hang of it. Overall, accounting is a hard subject don't blame the professor for it!!",149
mostow,4,A,BMGT310,"His tests are very easy if you know your material. He doesn't really teach, just reads the power-points that Wiley has provided. You honestly have to teach yourself. Out of 1004 points, the curve was only 25 points; which equates to 2.49%",149
raschid,1,A-,BMGT406,"The worst class I had ever taken at UMCP. If this class was not one of the requirements to graduate, I would never have signed up. The materials were challenging even for the professor(!). She does not seem to know the materials and very bad at lecturing. Most of the time she just rambled nonsense coding strategy. She seems to care for students but this doesn't help us success in this class. Do not ask for help with the In Class Assignment, they would take off points afterwards without prior disclosing this information.",151
raschid,1,A,BMGT406,Horrible professor; not a very nice person; always rattles in class and you end up with nothing. Claims to teach programming ans she knows nothing about programming,151
raschid,5,A,BMGT406,"Very nice and caring professor. Louiqa is one of the few professors that send out personal emails to students on a weekly basis to make sure that they are understanding the material and making good progress on the projects.

Her teaching style consists of going over PowerPoint lecture slides and posting them online for students to review. She also provides code examples for students to download, so you can see how the lecture concepts can be applied to web programming. It would be helpful if Louiqa could code some examples from scratch and explain slowly to students how everything works piece-by-piece.

Contrary to previous reviews, she followed her syllabus very closely and did not make any unexpected changes to the course requirements.

You should take BMGT406 with Louiqa because you will learn a great deal about web programming (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL).

To do well in the course, you must pay attention in each lecture and try to understand the concepts. Then, practice coding your own examples (be creative) to see if you truly understand the material. Only seek the TA or professor as a last resort if you are really stuck after attempting to solve the problem on your own (Google is a great resource!).",151
raschid,1,A,BMGT406,Professor is TERRIBLE. PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ABOUT HER. She is terribly unorganized and she does not have a real grasp on technology (in my opinion.) She needs to master organization skills.,151
raschid,5,A,BMGT406,"I enjoyed this class. The class is designed to provide hands on practice on web technologies. DR. Raschid has a great deal of experience and all the projects we did were not that hard at all. Besides, she and the TA were very positive and helpful and all you have to do is just ask for help. All the assignments were always briefly discussed  in class and even several examples were explained. I definitely recommend this class. You will learn not only the Web but lots of related technologies and social media. ",151
raschid,1,A,BMGT406,"DO NOT TAKE THIS.CLASS WITH HER. YOU WONT LEARN ANYTHING AND SHE WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.

The initial syllabus said that there will be only 7 programming assignments. Towards the end of the semester she suddenly decides to hold a ""non-graded"" assignment to determine whether the students have mastered the material since most of the students had high grades on the 7 assignments. Some of the assignments were not challenging at all and it's obvious most of the students have high grades. The problem was, it was never mentioned in the syllabus and student concerns about this non-graded assignment were never taken into consideration. Also 30% of the class grade comes from the semester project, and by the time she decided that most of the students will end up getting As for this class, we havent even started on the semester project which means, eventually everyone will get As for the semester project regardless of the quality. We did a class presentation which was supposed to be 10% of the grade, was completely taken out from the grading structure. It is not fair for her to do that after we have spent our time and efforts into that project/ presentation.

Overall her teaching style sucks. This is a programming class and she just reads out the slides which does not make sense at all. She keeps on spamming our emails by sending the same email over and over again for the slightest thing. Not professional at all. After the first couple of weeks, she asks the STUDENTS of ways to make the class more interesting. With all due respect, I dont think this professor is suitable for the Smith School and if she doesn't change her teaching style and remains in the Smith School, it will just bring down the standards of the Smith School. I honestly believe that she doesn't know her material much. If not for the TA, this class would have been an utter mess. I personally did not learn anything in the class but on my own. She is a nice person but I dont think she has enough knowledge or skills to teach this class. Afterall we all are paying to learn something but I don't feel I have gotten my money's worth.",151
raschid,5,A,BMGT406,"This is a great course to get some hands-on experience with programming. The course isn't all programming; for the latter half of the semester, you get to choose a project of your liking that doesn't necessarily have to involve coding. It is an interesting combination of programming, business, and tech topics like social media.

The professor and the TA are very helpful. For example, during lab sessions, if you're stuck with your code, they will come to your side and give you helpful hints (they don't just tell you to ""google it""...maybe occasionally they might, if your question is easily searchable). 

The majority of the students in this class earned A's. It wasn't a whole lot of work, though of course, you do need to put in some time and effort, just like every other class. We did have a final extra project for this class but it was basically just a recap of the previous projects. In fact, I found that project to be easier than the previous ones. ",151
raschid,5,,BMGT406,"Good IS elective, useful course content and curriculum. You need to have good problem solving skills to get the A in this class. Html css php and mysql are skills that nobody else learns in business school. Take this course if youre interested in learning some additional technical skills. Projects are fair.",151
raschid,1,B,BMGT406,"I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS. ON TOP OF ALL THAT, SHE IS NOT GOOD WITH CODING AT ALL! THE TA DOES ALMOST EVERYTHING FOR HER! SHE IS NOT PREPARED, TALENTED OR CONFIDENT. SHE GIVES ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE NOT MENTIONED ON THE SYLLABUS. FIND ANOTHER PROFESSOR OR DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER.",151
raschid,1,,BMGT406,"No idea what's going on in this class. It's useful in that it teaches you PHP and HTML, but seriously what happened between 2009 and 2011? Worst grading system ever. Because too many people were doing well in the class, she dealt out some randomass in-class assignment to be completed in three hours, as a skills test and weed out those who can't code quickly so that the grade distribution is more normal. There is also final project that is apparently not even graded but you have to do it anyway. I have never been so confused in my life. ",151
raschid,1,,BMGT406,"STAY AWAY THIS CLASS IS ONE OF THE MOST AGGRAVATING EXPERIENCES I HAVE HAD IN COLLEGE.  SHE AND THE TA TREAT THIS CLASS LIKE A COMP SCI CLASS!!! VERY PARTICULAR IN THE CODE GRADING, WHICH IS STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM.  UNLESS YOU KNOW PHP AND WEB CODING ALREADY, I REPEAT STAY AWAY.  SHE ADDS ASSIGNMENTS ON TO YOUR WORKLOAD THAT ARE NOT ON THE SYLLABUS JUST TO MAKE YOUR LIFE HELL. IF YOU ARE DOING A PROJECT AND HAVE QUESTIONS, THEY TELL YOU TO GOOGLE HOW TO DO IT.  ABSOLUTE WORST  ",151
raschid,3,A,BMGT406,"This course is really interesting and perfect for students who want to learn about web development and some of the technologies behind it.  The course covers basic PHP, MySQL commands, HTML, CSS, and web security.  No exams or quizzes - just projects and a technical paper that was due by the end of the semester.  The projects were good to show how all of the above mentioned technologies are used in unison.  Projects will be challenging if you have never done any type of programming before.  If you've done web development or programming prior to this course, then this will be an easy course.  Raschid is generous with grading, though.  She allows the projects to be re-submittable if you want to raise your grade on any of them.

The negatives about Raschid is she doesn't know much about PHP or the technologies used.  She knows why and how they're used, but doesn't have syntactical understanding of PHP.  This is important in 406 as a lot of students will be new to programming, thus having plenty of syntax errors in their projects.  The TA (graduated '09) was excellent and pretty much ran the course.  Without him, I am not sure if Raschid could effectively run the course on her own.  Raschid was also abrasive at random moments.  She became upset after she noticed some people habitually not appearing in class, so she made a lecture mandatory and literally said ""You will not get an A grade if you don't attend this lecture.""  She had a sign-in sheet at that lecture.  This kind of attitude put a sour vibe in the class and made her seem irrational and unpleasant.  

Overall, if you're looking for a course to learn more about web development/programming or want a course in your schedule with a light workload, then this might be a good class for you.  ",151
bardossy,1,,BMGT485,"Wow. Just wow. I'm currently typing this review in class as we have waited 10 minutes for one of her ""simulations"" to work. Events like this happen on a daily basis. We are currently in the 6th week a school and have not learned anything. No one knows how to do any of the content or assignments and we are not told how to do any of it. Heavy accent makes powerpoint lectures(once a week) hard to understand and the powerpoints themselves are in broken english(not a rag but its hard to learn if you can't understand any of the content). The course has no structure aside from barely following the book assigned to the class. Based off the readings, the powerponts probably cover about 50% of the book chapters and then 10% of that is actually taught to us as receivable information. This all may come off as angry or bitter but all of it is true. I'm not even complaining about my grade, I currently have a 95% and I barely do anything. We have an exam next week which I'm sure will tank me(and the class) as we aren't being told what is on it/the format/or given anything to study from. Head these warnings and don't just take them as some ""random person's biased views""; DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH MARIA BARDOSSY. I'm sorry but she is totally unfit to be teaching anyone.",153
bardossy,2,,BMGT485,"I have been in this class for over a month and a half and all we have learned is how to count. Bardossy is clueless when it comes to this course. She has no idea what she is doing and it shows. We have an exam next week and no one has any idea what is going to be on it. I can't even put an expected grade because I have no clue what she is going to grade, or how her exam is going to go. Take this class if you like busy work and a professor that doesn't know what she's doing. Only reason I gave her two stars instead on one is because she's a nice person.",153
bardossy,4,A+,BMGT485,"She is really not that bad. Yes, her classes are dull and a bit confusing at times, but her class is very easy and she is very nice. I currently have a 100.2% in her class because she allowed us to use a sheet of paper on the midterm. Despite being confused about the content of the course toward the beginning, she has made it very clear what we need to know for our quizzes and exams. ",153
bardossy,1,A-,BMGT434,"A lot of work. A couple of presentations a month, in the first half of the semester, but huge presentations weekly near the end of the semester. On top of the presentations, there's a lot of other homeworks/quizzes/readings/busy work sprinkled in. For the first few presentations, the TA and guest lecturers tried to wear you down, piss you off, and throw you off your game. Additionally, the presentations would be on extremely vague cases with little to no guidance.

With a couple of weeks left in this semester, I can confidently say that I haven't learned anything yet. Her lectures are the hardest things to sit through, and I have not understood a single thought she has tried to convey. I really don't know why she's teaching.",153
bardossy,1,B,BMGT434,"This class was one of the most time consuming and stressful classes I have ever taken. We had an open ended and complex group project once a week while also having long HWs throughout the semester. She is very nice, but her teaching is  not  on par with her expectations. She is very smart, but is not great at explaining her thoughts. Overall, do not take this class unless you want to be working on nonstop group projects that are very difficult.",153
bonavia,3,A,BMGT451,"Professor Bonavia is a two sided coin.

One one hand, she knows her material well. She's been in the industry and generally gives good examples that make understanding the material easier.

HOWEVER, as a person, she is very self absorbed. You will learn everything about how she and her husband have a lot of money and how they like to spend it. She's also really anal about not using technology which is infuriating. We live in the 21st century and whether she likes it or not, there are many people who learn by taking notes on a laptop but because she doesn't like that, no laptops allowed in her class.

Overall, I would not take her unless you're really passionate about Consumer Research.",155
bonavia,4,B+,BMGT451,"A real teacher that knows her material and teaches it well. Attendance taken every day and powerpoints are not online so you have to take notes.  Class is interactive and if you are a marketing major it should be interesting material. She tells you 90% of the exam concepts the class before the test. You actually have to read 5 or 6 of the chapters in the book.

As a person she is a nice lady but really self obsessed.  You will hear more about her personal life than you ever have from any of your teachers. I guarantee that. Strangely she prefers to be phone called rather than emailed. Pretty accessible and will work with you.  Good teacher in the Smith School",155
bonavia,5,A,BMGT350,"As a TA she is very helpful. She makes every effort to make sure her students excel above those of the other TAs. She spells out exactly what she expects from every student, including the topic of each paragraph of the paper - something people in other sections struggle with. I highly recommend her as a TA, but I've heard horror stories of her as a teacher.",155
bonavia,1,,BMGT350,"The way the class was structured was weird... she recorded herself giving the lecture with a projector. When we would tell her the slides were blurry because she was too far, she would disagree and not upload the class powerpoints.",155
loewenstein,5,B,BMGT343,"Fantastic teacher, as the other review said. Do the homework problems, they are the key to doing well on his exams. You don't have to worry about going to the review sessions because they are posted online in video format - but make sure to watch them because he goes through every step. Also, pay attention in class because he goes over really advanced techniques that make the simple math methods easy to comprehend. Really intelligent, great teacher! Also, start on the project early, and ask him for help.",156
loewenstein,5,A,BMGT343,"Probably the best Investments professor.  Homework is not collected and he gives you the answers so you can figure out the problems on your own.  One project at the end of the semester, one midterm and one final. Make sure to pay attention when he goes over the projects becasue it will help a lot. The exams aren't too bad becasue the questions are the same as the homework, so make sure you know how to do all of the problems, even if there is only one question in the homework on a particular concept.  You also might have to write in explanations for your answers on the exam.  10% of the grade is participation, but only a few kids in my class participated much.  Class isn't exciting and doing the homework is usually more helpful. ",156

harms,4,B,,"Professor Harms is incredibly nice and very knowledgable on the subject.  Her class is very interesting and the work is never too much to handle.

The only reason I wont give her 5 stars is that I felt it was very difficult to figure what was going to be on the exams.  Even though she gave us a study guide of all of the important points of the chapter, there were numerous slides that had no words on them, so unless you got the important info (which was hard sometimes if she moved to fast) you were ut of luck.

keim,2,B,BMGT422,"I wouldn't advise taking this course with her due to the demanding workload and needing to write down practically every word she says to have good notes.  Her powerpoints barely mention the concepts you need to know, and the questions you'll get asked require a much deeper understanding of the material.  She also assigns a 3,500 word paper and I don't believe the other professors do that.  She also 1) yells at people every day for wearing hats or not acting with chivalry 2) Outright bans laptops from her classroom 3) Is painfully boring.  I feel like I'm definitely learning but I don't think the exams are fair and fear for my grade.",160

padhi,1,A-,BMGT340,"Not sure why Padhi has no reviews yet but I guess I will write one for him. If you're choosing between him and Hallows, I'd say choose the lesser of 2 evils and pick Padhi. I'm sure he would never show the lack of respect and empathy Hallows showed after a student's family member was affected by covid-19.

Now for the actual course, it wasn't bad. Padhi himself is a boring lecturer and you do most of the learning from the textbook anyways. Classes are only for doing example exercises and doing clicker questions for participation credit.

The exams are complete trash and I say this as someone who managed to get an overall A-. I can only imagine how those who did worse felt. The 1st exam was good. But the 2nd, 3rd, and final were terribly written. One question didn't even have a correct answer and he didn't realize this until midway thru the exam, forcing many students to waste time figuring out what was wrong. 

There are also live cases hosted by visiting banks/firms, but I can say most people found them completely useless. And the worst part is they even asked questions about the cases on the exams.

Overall UMD definitely needs to change up this course, make it more like BMGT230 where you actually do learning in class. Or remove Padhi and Hallows and actually hire competent professors to teach business finance. Either option would improve this class tremendously. ",164
padhi,5,A+,BMGT340,"y'all take padhi for summer finance classes! I took BMGT340 with Padhi for Summer 2020 and it was honestly the best decision I've made for classes so far (that and taking COMM107 over the summer). Padhi was engaging and he made tough topics make sense. The volume of work was pretty intense, especially with a condensed class, but we got to meet his the service dog he's training (Dole) and he genuinely cared about his students. In my class, exams were open-note but he encouraged us to make one formula sheet and that helped so much. Exams were tough and every exam had an oral portion where you meet with the TA or Prof Padhi for fifteen minutes and solve a question. Padhi told us exactly what the oral question would be and the things we had to study, so as stressful as being on a Zoom call with just the prof is, he did his best to prepare us. Also, grading for oral portion is super lenient as long as you just explain how you got there well, even the wrong answer will get you pretty decent partial credit. 

I was terrified of taking BMGT340 but I would highly encourage anyone who can to take it over the summer with Padhi, you'll have to grind, but it's really better than taking it during the semester.",164
padhi,5,A,BMGT340,"Padhi is one of the best business professors i've encountered. He knows the material inside-out. The flipped classroom is not my favorite model but this course makes it work extremely well - you are expected to watch a short video lecture and complete basic review before attending the live lecture, where Padhi works out several examples and goes over each concept and formula. Very receptive to questions (I've never been to office hours but asked questions in class) and doesn't assume that his first method of explanation is going to work for everyone. Zoom U was great with Padhi because he shows his dogs and kids sometimes. The course provides a good amount of weekly work but each assignment is valuable and does not feel like busywork. There is adequate extra practice if you want to prepare for an exam or if you don't understand a particular concept. Exam questions can be tricky but similar practice is always provided beforehand. Real-world examples keep the course interesting and applicable. All around a fantastic course and professor. I literally made a planetterp account to write this review because this was great.",164
padhi,5,A,BMGT340,Padhi is a great professor. This is a tough class but he makes it manageable. Clearly cares about his students and does his best to give us the resources to do well in the class. Exams are hard but if you study using past exams you will probably be fine. We do a ton of practice problems in class which makes it easier to learn. He is receptive to questions in class and doesn't talk down to students like other professor's do sometimes. Definitely recommend taking him for 340!,164
trusov,2,,BMGT484,It's an easy class but by far the most pointless I have ever taken. The information you learn in this class is so simple you feel like you're back in middle school. I have taken some bad classes but this one is by far the most useless class I have ever taken.,167
trusov,5,A,BMGT484,"Really respectable teacher. Exams are very easy, just do the book questions and follow his study guide. The website projects (one personal one group) are not at all bad. My group got a 100% on our group paper/website prototype.

However, he does get a little particular about the case reflection papers. Be careful to think through them and not just throw useless information, because you will lose points. He also compares your paper to the rest of the class, which is weird.",181

This class was a lot of work, some assignments graded easily while others strictly with many assignments due on Sundays, and massive group projects. Compared to friends of mine taking this course with other professors, their workload was significantly less, but it also seems they got less out of the class than I did. This class is great for real-life preparation, while it sounds as though other BMGT495 professors are an easier route to take, but you will not get the same experience.",182

hutchins,3,A-,BMGT110F,"Hutchins was one of the most interesting classes in the business school. I was usually eager to attend his class. 
He does not teach so you have to take notes from the textbook on your own. He generally lectures on current business events which can be useful to anyone looking for a path in business. 
If you participate once every 2 or 3 classes you will get 100% for that category.
He curves his tests a lot but still study the docs on ELMS and vocab from the textbook.",189
hutchins,3,A-,BMGT110,"Hutchins's class was probably the most fun I've ever had in a classroom setting. I actually looked forward to his class, knowing that current events and ancillary stories were on the agenda. 

However, as a teacher, the guy did not really help all that much. We fell chronically behind, and while the group project was something to help your grade provided you put effort into it (he left a lot a criticism on every group's work, yet gave everyone good grades), your grade really comes down to two heavily curved tests, and the reason they were curved so heavily is that we covered scant amounts of the information in class. 

Essentially, this guy has a lot to tell you about life and real world experience in business, but I'd recommend forming a study group early and meet often to do well on the tests. 

Also, participate. He actually does take notice of who does and who doesn't, and it will affect grades. ",189
hutchins,1,B,BMGT110F,"Hutchins is a nice guy and genuinely cares about his students, but I just don't think he knows how to do that appropriately. He doesn't teach, wasting countless hours going over business stories shared by students in class and speaking about his kids and how many times he got sued (but never lost!). I retained absolutely no information that the course is supposed to teach you, as the most teaching he will do is mumbling back exactly what the textbook says (he will actually take out the textbook and just read it all class). The lectures lack any structure, with no PowerPoints and no notes to follow. There is additionally no work outside of the class except for the group project, which at first seems like a great thing, but only comes to screw you when 75% of the grade is based on 2 tests and you have no way to get the information to stick in your head.

If you take Hutchins, you're really opting to have no teacher, and to just take the course entirely on your own.",189
hutchins,3,b,BMGT110F,"for my first business class i was extremely disappointed. he didn't really teach. he would tell stories about his Princeton son, his other high leveled positions, and about Louisiana. never gave us any material for exam review, in fact, we didn't even review in class on what was going to be on the exam. exams contained T/F questions and questions on documents he uploads on elms. don't bother reading the textbook because he doesn't want us to get ""bogged down in the weeds."" ",189
hutchins,1,A-,BMGT110F,"Unfortunately, this site does not allow you to award zero stars... 
From the name of the course, you'll probably expect it to be an easy A. If you have Hutchins, you are dead wrong. Now, this is not because the material is terribly complex or difficult. It's because of the fact that this ""course"" hardly has any structure. You'll come to class, listen to some rambling about business stories in the news or stock prices, hear some more rambling about his Ivy League sons, past careers, etc., and then about halfway through class, some random quotes from your textbook will be directly read/paraphrased. No lecture, no slideshow, nothing to formally delineate the objectives of that class's lesson. Hutchins repeats himself over and over again about small tedious facts, such as the three main exports of the United States, or the fact that Maryland has tax-free gold. Expect to hear these facts mentioned in at least one in three classes. 
Now these aspects of the course may lead you to believe that the class is a joke (you're right) and you do not need to attend lecture (you're WRONG). When the midterm rolled around, those who did not attend class were basically screwed. This is because the majority of the test content comes from his ""witty"" remarks in class and obscure documents posted on Blackboard rather than substantive material. Also, despite numerous requests, Hutchins will not give you any resources to prepare for this exam, such as a study guide, review session or practice test. Despite numerous requests for such materials, his response was ""go over your notes, the book, and Blackboard."" Umm, okay....
Because of the unanticipated difficulty/obscurity of the questions on the midterm, I took prepping for the final very seriously and attended every lecture. However, when I got to the test, I felt like I was looking at a bunch of trivia questions. The test featured true or false questions about whether or not a specific quote was featured in a particular article he'd posted on Blackboard and questions that were very opinion-driven regarding ethical dilemmas. After the test, I heard that 87.5 was the second highest grade! No wonder Hutchins's average differs so much from that of other professors.
Also, there is a business plan project that you are required to work on throughout the semester. Despite the amount of time and effort required for this project, it only comprises 15% of your grade. Therefore, I suggest you don't look to a good grade on this as a ""saving grace"" for poor test grades. Together, the midterm and the final comprise 75% of your final average, so poor grades here will clearly dominate your average.
At the end of Hutchins' course, I went to look back at the course objectives on his syllabus, because I felt like I hadn't learned anything of substance class. Could I give an in depth description for any of these objectives? Nope. Could I tell you the careers and alma maters of Hutchins' sons, his home state, and his favorite place to buy gold? You bet.
In short, don't take this professor for 110, and if you must, don't take the course as a joke (even though it is.)",189

He seems normal at first, but after you've heard about his son's achievements or the number of times he's been to Panama about 3000 times you'll start to realize that this class is a waste of time.  If you have any choice of getting out of Hutchin's section for fellows i would try as hard as possible to do so.

DON'T TAKE HUTCHINS",189

I cannot stress enough how extremely difficult his exams are, and if you don't read every word of that textbook, you are screwed. Going to class is not even close to necessary, except for the ""participation points"", which you earn by raising your hand and asking him a question about his personal life. If you are taking this class for any reason than a major requirement, don't do it unless you want to read a 500 page textbook cover to cover. ",189
lefkoff,5,A,BMGT350,"Lefkoff is the typical marketing professor; friendly, enthusiastic, and engaging. She loves to tell stories and she even admits early on that she goes more in-depth with the topics instead of just running you through the textbook terms. The good news is that means you get some interesting classes with games and activities. The bad news is that for the tests, you have to read the textbook to actually learn the terms you're being tested on.

Her tests are reasonable and the marketing assignments you get are an easy A. You do have to do a presentation at the beginning of a class based on a current event that matches the chapter of the day, but that's graded generously as well. I have heard the other BMGT350 are amazing too, but you can't go wrong with Lefkoff!",194
lefkoff,4,A-,BMGT350,"Dr. Lefkoff is a very, very nice person. She is so enthusiastic and loves what she does. As many people have mentioned her teaching does not really correspond with the textbook. In other words, you will fail if you do not read the textbook. 

Her exams are mainly memorizing definitions from the textbook, so definitely make flash cards or something. Also her exams always have questions about class discussions or about videos we watch in class, so make sure you go to class!!

Everyone is required to make a 4 minute presentation, so almost all of our classes in the semester started with 4 different presentation, so that took up about 15-20 minutes of our class time.

We do a lot of group/partner work. Class is kinda boring, but Dr. Lefkoff is always so enthusiastic.
There's some hw that's pretty easy. 

I would say it's pretty easy to get an A if you read the textbook and memorize the definitions, go to class, and do all the hw/research. 

She is very nice and I would definitely recommend taking it with her!",194
lefkoff,4,A-,BMGT350,"Dr. Lefkoff is really nice, and very energetic. In class, she just goes over some terms, which will not cover everything you need for the exam (you'll have to read the book for that). The exams are 60 multiple choice, which are not very difficult, but it's not that easy to get an A in either. We also had some students presentation each class, which pretty much, nobody listens too, but count for 10% of your grade. From time to time, she'll also show some videos, give some examples or discuss something in class that isn't on the textbook, and that will probably end up as exam questions (in our last exam, I counted at least 5-6 questions like this). To me, this class basically just consisted in memorizing a bunch of terms, so I can't say I've gotten much from it (as others have put it, pretty much a useless class). If you end up in her class (especially the 9:30am section), you'll enjoy it, because she's always super excited and full of energy, but be prepared to put in the effort to read the book to do well in the exams. Overall, it's probably easy to get a B, but very hard to get an A in the end.",194
lefkoff,2,B,BMGT350,"Does this lady even teach? The classes is an hour and fifteen minutes long and she teaches for about fifteen minutes of it. The rest of student presentations that no one gives a shit about.

lefkoff,3,A-,BMGT350,"Lefkoff is a very excitable, high-energy woman. Some days she's just bouncing all over the place, going in and out of different voices and just overall acting crazy. Her lectures are interesting, although not necessarily relevant to the textbook (which contains 90% of the exam material but is never covered in class). The exams are not overly difficult, but it is not easy to get an A. There are also few opportunities for points outside of the exams (75% of total). I very much like Lefkoff as a person. She's very nice but I just don't get much out of her class. Of the 75 minutes she has us, 15-20 is spent on student article presentations that everyone more or less ignores, ~20 minutes for some awful video that will put you to sleep, but probably wind up as an obscure exam question, and the rest of the time is just her speaking excitedly on just a small fraction of the chapter we will be tested on. If you are good at memorizing long lists of terms for exams, you may do well in this class, but I can't say I learned much in regard to marketing.",194
lefkoff,1,B,BMGT350,"If you want a professor who shows consideration for their students, do not take Lefkoff. She is not understanding and does not work with you to resolve unique issues/problems. Here is a direct quote from her final email: 
""Please note that there is NO EXTRA CREDIT.  It is not an option, at all, under any circumstances.  Please do NOT ask for extra credit.  I will not respond to any emails that request extra credit."" 

Her teaching method is also very odd, she lectures off of her own notes and then pulls exam questions from some test bank that she didn't teach to. ",194

Especially if you are in the Honors version.

More about the H-version (it is very different from the regular course): there are two exams, each covering half of the book. Each students is required to prepare a ""discussion lead"" once during the semester, where they will pick out two articles related to the chapter they are assigned and discuss it during the class. Finally, there is the Final Project, which is composed of a 15 minute presentation (individually) and a 12-15 page paper.

All in all, not that bad of a class. She will expect you to do all of the readings on your own to prepare for the exams.",194
lefkoff,2,b-,BMGT350,"Professor Lefkoff is one professor I would never forget. She is so enthusiastic and inspiring. She does everything in her power to make subjects interesting. As someone that does not particularly like the subject, the way she teaches the course helps me find the material a bit interesting and worth concentrating on. HOWEVER, her teaching method does not correspond to the way she makes the exam. There are always some areas of confusion. If you are not a good test taker, you would most likely fail every of her tests which make about 85% of your grade. The tests are also tiring. There are 60 questions for 75 minutes and you have to really think through any of them to get the right answers, which is not always given. I won't necessarily recommend her, but if you end up in her class, make sure to have a very strong plan of attack.",194
lefkoff,2,B+,BMGT350,"Nearly useless professor. She's a nice woman but it's absolutely ridiculous how she teaches.

First of all, she did not make the powerpoints. She gets them from Cengage, which is the company that produced the textbook. The textbook only touches on the most important aspects, but it ignores some of the smaller aspects, which are on the exam. 

Even worse, her lectures are based almost entirely on the powerpoints. I was reading the book before class and I learned absolutely nothing new. She even uses the same examples given in the book. She skips through a lot of crucial information in the powerpoints, which are eventually on the exam.

But you are almost obligated to attend class because she uses some case studies or videos (like 2 or 3 per midterm), and those are on the midterm/final. The worst part is she tests you on things that have nearly nothing to do with the course, and would not help you whatsoever in the future, and would not matter whatsoever if you remember it or not. For example, asking what juices a specific company produces. Who cares?",194
lefkoff,5,A,BMGT350,"Great professor. Boring powerpoint presentations, but what do you expect? Study the book and the practice questions on the book CD; they will appear on the exams. Make sure you participate a lot because she does NOT just give 100%'s on participation to anyway (you wont get above a B-/C+ on participation if you simply show up and don't talk). very straightforward material if you study the book. she's a great professor and does her best to engage her students in discussion. After all, that's the best way to learn marketing.",194
lefkoff,5,A-,BMGT350,"Professor Lefkoff is very animated and makes the classes fun and interesting. She's a really nice person to listen to, but the material can be a bit pointless. The exams are also pretty hard because there's always 2 or 3 answers that seem plausible. If you don't test well, it'll be a challenging class because exams make up pretty much all of your grade. Be sure to pay attention to all the materials in class, since little details can show up on the exam.",194
lefkoff,2,C+,BMGT350,"This was probably one of the most pointless classes that I have sat though at UMD. The way her exams are weighted(3 make up 80% of your grade) and structured of them is totally unfair, and makes attending class pretty much pointless. All of the questions are A-E multiple choice almost every one can be narrowed down to two choices, and I basically guessed between the two for each one. I was one of the few students that actually came to class and contributed to the lecture but that didn't help my grade obviously. If I could go back in time I wouldn't have ever gone to class and allocated my time more effectively to reading the book during class time.

If you're like me and you expect the professor to teach you the concepts during the lectures and not try to trick you on exams, then I wouldn't recommend taking BMGT350 with Dr. Lefkoff.

This is the first C I've ever received in college and I'm very unhappy about it.",194
lefkoff,4,B+,BMGT350,"Prof. Lefkoff is a really great lecturer as she makes what is very boring material interesting. Be prepared to see her get super excited about the subject and start running and screaming all over the room. Be prepared to hear stories from her college days and working for a oil refinery as a young adult. Be prepared to hear stories about her personal life that makes you shake your head.

Overall, course is not difficult, you just have to read textbook and pay attention to every detail as it will pop up in the exams. Lowest exam score was a 84 and highest was a 88 but she offers no curve, so I got a B+ after the project and written case. Had I kept up the readings and note taking pulling off an A would not be that difficult.

Going to class is not necessary, but I did show up for most of her lectures because I enjoyed her. Overall, I would recommend her, but my classmates complained that the exam questions were tricky. I didn't really find that to be the case when I knew what the question was talking about. ",194

As for the course, well, it's pretty difficult. The exams ask very specific questions that she doesn't cover in lecture. The case studies are also graded pretty harshly. One classmate told me that they basically grade them like this: perfect 100%, good 85%, poor 75%, so on and so forth. No in-betweens. You'll have to do a lot of reading and a lot of studying for the exams. The group project is pretty easy, a 20 minute presentation on how a company could improve its marketing strategies. ",194
lefkoff,3,B,BMGT350,"She is a crazy lady, but lecture is very entertaining because of it.  She runs around the room talking to the class and trying to get everyone excited.  Lecture is very enjoyable for her class, I enjoyed it and I reccomend going.

As for her tests I found them to be incredibly challenging and are worth a huge chunk of your grade, I believe the breakdown is 26% 27% 27% for her 3 exams.  No final which is nice, just a class project.  I thought the exams were VERY challenging, she uses a great deal of stuff from lectures mixed in with vocabulary.  I got the hang of it by the last exam, but I escaped with a 80% by the hair of my chin.

I spent all semester not going to class because the powerpoints were online but it cost me on the final.  A lot of her questions came from stuff she explained in class which made pulling an all-nighter going through slides and online material before the final not too effective.

viswanathan,3,B-,BMGT301,"Siva is an incredibly smart man and really knows what he is talking about when it comes to info systems. He should be teaching upper level classes instead of intro.  This is not good for business school students that just want to knock out useless bmgt301. He generally can see through BS answers on exams. he makes 3 or 4 versions of his exams that are all completely different so cheating is impossible. he posts his powerpoints online so paying attention during class is not necessary.  He sent around a sign-in sheet for class participation.

bottom line, if you are actually interested in info systems, this is a good teacher but if you were like me and just wanted to knock out another useless core, I'd look for another teacher.",203
viswanathan,2,C,BMGT301,"This class was extremely challenging for an ""introduction"" course.  Siva was very hard to understand and not very considerate of student questions or concerns.  He generally teaches graduate courses and therefore has very high, unreasonable expectations for his undergraduate students.  You have to attend class in order to fill in the power point slides.  The quizzes and exams are exceptionally challenging.  The Excel and Access assignments are nearly impossible. He makes himself available for office hours but tends to speak down upon students rather than send an approachable vibe.

I highly recommend taking the course with another professor, or choosing the freshman fellows option.  Otherwise, you need to constantly review the material and ask clarifying questions to earn a decent grade. ",203
viswanathan,2,B,BMGT301,"Overall, professor Siva cares about the students.  He isnt mean and tries to teach.  Unfortunately, his class is terribly boring and utterly useless.  He is hard to understand and does not make the course work interesting.  Powerpoint slides will do instead of attendance, but tests are a little challenging.  Overall, I thought it was a big waste of my time",203
heston,2,B,BMGT446,"Doesn't really teach, final was pretty easy but did not learn a single thing. ",204
anenson,5,A,BMGT380,"Amazing blaw professor. Will go out of the way to help you and teaches content in a very thorough and understandable way. Tests are straightforward but can be tricky sometimes, though she gives practice problems. Participation is easy points for grabs, and workload is on the lighter side. Grade heavily weighted on exams (no homework)",205
corsi,5,A,BMGT470,Course has one exam and two lengthy reports that are completed with a partner. The exam is fair but is entirely essay based. The other major component of the course is the airline simulation which is quite fun. Corsi is a good guy but gets angry when people skip class (which probably affects their grade) If you're someone who goes to every class the this is a great course for you,208
foulk,1,B,BMGT364,"This teacher was very unaccommodating to the needs of the students, and gave reading exams every day for the first 8 minutes of class. He would rush lectures and would not meet up with students if they were struggling. Group projects we graded extremely low, and he would not realize any mistake as his own but rather blame the students. I scored an A on every exam but still got a B in the class. Do not recommend to anyone.",210

jawahery,4,,PHYS405,"Phys 405 is difficult. It just is. Now that we've gotten that out of the way...Prof. Jawahery is great in that he explains certain concepts very well. Sometimes he might nitpick (instance in a lab report or presentation), but usually it is not to be critical in the negative sense but helpful and INSTRUCTIVE.",216
kanigowski,5,A,MATH406,"Professor Kanigowski is phenomenal. I had him for Math 406 as a freshmen. He is so kind and patient. He is the kind of professor who is extremely brilliant but also cares about his students learning the material. He understands that students might not necessarily understand the material through one approach and if you ask questions or he notices that he has lost student in his lecture, he will go back through what he just taught and try to teach it in a different way so it makes sense.

ASK QUESTIONS IN CLASS!!! He is so willing to help you understand and he WANTS you to ask questions. He will repeatedly ask during lecture if there are any questions, and every time I have asked (which was a lot) he always made sure to answer it to the best of his abilities and I always understood it better. He is very nice at office hours and will spend however much time it takes going over problems until you feel comfortable. His homework and midterm prep are very useful and you will feel very well prepared for his exams if you complete them. 

The class breakdown is 6 to 7 graded homework assignments with 1 midterm and 1 final. However the homework and lectures really prepare you for the midterm and final so you will be okay. He does not require you to attend lecture, and the book is helpful, but I found his lectures to be a lot more helpful than the textbook, and he doesn't go in order of everything in the book so you at least need to know what topics he covered in class. I would highly recommend attending lectures.

Side note - I had him during the time that UMD went online for the second half of the second semester because of COVID - 19 and he did so much to make sure that all his students were okay. He made sure to modify the curriculum and add more office hours so that we knew we could reach out to him. He said he cares more about his students understanding what he has taught than just bulldozing though material for the sake of saying he completed everything on his timeline. He is great for people who love math, or who struggle with math. He will challenge your brain to think different for those who enjoy it, and he is there to support you and encourage you when you struggle.  100% recommend taking him and I would take his class again if I could.

hassam,5,B,PHYS121,"Dr. Hassam is awesome! He is so friendly and funny – he tries to make lecture entertaining. The examples he gives in class are not nearly as hard as the ones on the exams, but if you go to discussion and understand MasteringPhysics problems, you will be very well prepared for exams. I had Jack for my TA and he was very helpful. Lab is hard, but I still managed to get an 89% for my total lab grade. There are also occasional quizzes in discussion, which count for 5% of your grade, about a dozen MasteringPhysics homeworks (15%), two midterms (15% each), the final (30%), and lab counts for 20%. Hassam gives a very generous curve. The midterms consists of about 4 multiple choice/ true or false questions and about 4 problems. I did well in lab and on homework, but I failed most of the exams and still received a B in the course. He assigns grades relatively, meaning you are graded according to how everyone else in the class performs. Dr. Hassam doesn’t like to fail anyone if he can help it. If you study hard, do all of the homeworks, and attend every discussion you will do well in this class. ",218
hassam,4,B+,PHYS121,"He's a very nice guy, and a good lecturer. He uses a lot of demonstrations and generally wants everyone to do well. The curve this semester was ~5%. ",218
hassam,4,A,PHYS121,"Hassam is ALRIGHT. I mean, he makes a lot of mistakes in lecture...and in the end you learn that lecture notes aren't even that helpful. He takes a lot of problems from MasteringPhysics and rewords them for his quizzes/finals. His syllabus is online if you just google ""Hassam Phys 121""

Overall, I thought he was both an enthusiastic lecturer and fair grader. You got to bring in cheat sheets to the exams (full pages). He's very understanding, I definitely recommend him! ",218
hassam,5,,PHYS121,"Class is strait forward. Attend lecture and practice problems and you will be fine. Dr. Hassam as a professor is a consummate professional and just an awesome guy in general. From the first day you can tell he is happy to be teaching and really wants you to do well in his class as much as he wants you to learn the material. I can understand everything he is saying and he doesn't speak in monotone. He care about his students and will always keep you in the loop of where the class is going. He sends e-mails to his students every day and is constantly looking for ways to improve your grade that will actually help you learn the material at the same time (he doesnt just throw you curves, he offers opportunities to raise your grade by showing you know the material), but even then he will still curve the class as he really doesn't want you to do poorly. Fair tests, fair homeworks, fair labs, Nice professor, helpful and relaxed TA. Couldn't ask for more...",218
hassam,4,A,PHYS121,"You can actually understand Hassam, unlike a majority of the physics faculty. If you took physics in high school and actually remember some of the underlying concepts (such as F=ma), then you will have no trouble getting an A. His exams are straightforward, and most of the problems are just derivations of the homework problems. The best part about his exams is that you get to bring a one page cheat sheet (2 pages for the final). ",218
hassam,4,,PHYS601,Prof. Hassam lays a lot of stress on students being able to understand the concepts more than do hard problems. His PHYS 601 class was very interactive. Some of the topics such as WKB and Geometric Optics may require more initiative from your own side. He is especially quick with responding to emails. What got me through this course is keeping up with what's going on in the lecture and reading the notes after class. His grading is lenient in general.,218
hassam,5,A+,PHYS410,I took PHYS410 with Hassam during the online fiasco that was Fall 2020. I really enjoyed his class though - his online teaching style is not my favorite (reading from prewritten notes) but his explanations of concepts are very good and his tests are remarkably fair and educational. I found that with his open note tests this semester that I was actively learning new things through his problems while still being able to get good grades. PHYS410 with Hassam is a very stress-free way to take PHYS410 while still walking away from the class with a much better understanding of the subject. ,218

Cons:
You'll never be as smart as he is
The class is genuinely difficult
He is a very boring lecturer

childs,5,A,CMSC451,"Incredible professor. His lectures are very clear and the expectations for students are very reasonable. This is a challenging class, but it's worth taking because you'll learn a ton.",219
childs,5,C,CMSC451,"Childs is probably the best professor I have ever had out of all the other CMSC professors next to Max for 423. Hands down takes the best notes, is easy to follow in class, and he is really interesting (his field of study is quantum algorithms). The only sort-of complaint I have is he doesn't post his notes online, but that never really bothered me and you definitely learn a lot when you're at lecture.

More importantly however is how hard this class is. Yes, the first half of the class is 351 material, but with 2 week long assignments and a final that is worth almost half your grade, the class has very little room to make up for lost points easily due to its structure.

I will say the class was harder than 351 for me, as I had Golub for 351 and received a B at the end, and I wasn't the best at proofs coming in to this class.

My advice is if you are VERY confident in your ability to solve proofs then you should definitely take Childs; he's absolutely the best professor for this class. It honestly all comes down to how confident you feel about taking 451.

P.S: I'm giving 5 stars because Childs is AMAZING, not because of the course material or its difficulty.",219
childs,4,C+,CMSC451,"Childs is insanely smart; he, for the most part, single-handedly managed the course Piazza. He writes his notes (on an iPad projected to the screen) in a way that students can copy word for word, which is nice when we need to review the concepts, but makes class a frantic effort to copy notes (missing a lot of what Childs has to say verbally).

His final was pretty fair in my opinion. He sticks very close to the book ""Algorithm Design"" (available as a PDF online).

451 is a tough class. I guess it will improve some algorithmic thinking skills.",219
childs,5,A,CMSC451,"Probably one of the best professors to have for a difficult class. He almost instantly replies to all Piazza posts, has great lectures, and he is very kind. This class was hard but the material I learned from it was invaluable and absolutely essential for any CS student.",219

childs,5,C,CMSC451,"Andrew Childs is such an amazing professor. He is clear and calm in his lectures, always willing to re-explain material, and his homeworks and exams are very fair. Not easy, but fair.
When I had him, he took notes on an iPad and displayed them on the board as he taught, to show many examples and explain theorems. However, he didn't post those notes - so make sure you take your own!

childs,5,A-,CMSC451,"Definitely the best professor for CMSC451. The lecture videos are concise, well put together, and very informative.

(Disclaimer: had him during fall 2020 virtual semester) 

I found the course a lot easier than 351. The homeworks were a bit challenging but I found that the TAs, at least during this semester, graded very generously (the rubrics are not like 351 where it’s basically 0%, 50%, or 100% per question). The tests were kind of hard to do under a time crunch but they were generally easier than the homeworks and again had generous rubrics. Childs is a nice professor and responsive to the students - he extended the deadline on one of our homeworks. If you’re interested in 451 I recommend taking it with him. ",219

He is very nice and takes the time to learn everyone's name. He has a great desire to turn us into well spoken and productive individuals during our time here, which is a grand goal.

Graders will take off points on the homework for weird or maybe incomprehensible reasons (for example, I had ten points, or 1 percent of the final grade, taken off a correct use of a logical fallacy probably because it was not politically correct). Others had points taken off for being too terse, which I feel is unfair for most questions.",223

I had him for both astr 230 and 340 and both of those classes were quite a challenge with him as a lecturer. Do not get me wrong, he can be an effective professor but can come off as rude and material such as homework and exams can be rather tricky. In astro 230 the average on each exam was a 65, 58, 70, and 68. Which is actually much lower than astro 340 exams which were about 70 to 73 each. Saving grace for 230 was there was no final and there are alot of free points for discussion assignments and clickers.

His curve at the end appropriately reflected the very low average in the class, but for the easiness of the material taught the questions were over the top and incredibly time-consuming. At times it felt as though the TA grading our homework was inconsistent in their methods and was trying to work against us.",223
peel,5,B,ASTR230,"Very likeable professor, puts a lovely brand of dry humor throughout lectures and discussions. The course itself is challenging in that there is almost always something imminent: discussion 3 times a week with a worksheet, working on the Group Project Solar System towards the end of semester, etc. Otherwise, the discussions are graded on how much effort you put into them. The first couple units are math units with the expectations of an English class: make a good enough case, provide the evidence of your thought process, and get corrected if you were wrong later. You will still receive the points, just make sure you know the real answers for the tests. 

Professor Peel always had a chat open during the discussion for questions, and was ALWAYS real with us. If there was an idea that didn't work out, or something in particular that he expected from us, he would tell us. He mentions things like ""I see multiple groups doing this, that, -- please be aware that I am expecting you to know  (something important)."" Always respectful, in my experience.

Also, use ratios. Always.

criticism is that the workload felt overwhelming for a class that's supposed to be for non-science majors. I didn't
expect the class to be easy by any means, but even then I felt drained constantly. He had post-lecture assignments after
every class that sometimes took hours to finish. For a 1 hr 15 minute exam he would give 30+ questions, half of which were

Just want to warn that she does not curve. That's because the tests are not insanely hard; the average is usually in the low 80's. Her tests are predominantly vocab-based, so flash cards will be your savior. She also does not have office hours, she only works by appointment. That intimidated me into never seeing her since I never had too serious of a question. ",227
bely,5,A,BSCI106H,"Professor Bely is awesome! She is super sweet and very passionate about her subject! I think the class itself lends itself to be pretty dry, and I think she does the best she can to make it interesting. 

She posts all her lectures online, which is great. I think a lot of people skipped lecture because they just took notes on the stuff she posted online. It's pretty much the same thing. If you are someone who likes to have a professor in front of you actively teaching, then definitely go to lecture. But if you are someone who doesn't find evolution/ecology particularly difficult and you can self-study effectively, then take advantage of her online lecture notes. That being said, there are some things she talks about in lecture that she doesn't put in her online notes. She asks thoughtful questions during class, and sometimes the answer isn't on the online lecture notes because we answer them out loud in lecture. 

The exams are easy. But I do know some people who struggled with her exams. I guess it depends on how you study and how your brain works. I understood ecology and evolution pretty well already before I entered her class because I had taken AP Bio. But even if I hadn't taken AP Bio, I feel like I would have done well because everything on the exam is something she has talked about. Her exams are more detail oriented I think. A few times, the discussion-like questions she posed during lecture appeared in the exam. But I didn't get below an A on any exam because she gives you all the information you need to know. It's just up to you if you are willing to put in the time and energy to memorize and learn the information.

Time on exams was never an issue for me. I feel like most people in the class finished the exam with plenty of time to spare. The exams usually consist of like...maybe 25 multiple choice questions, 10 fill in the blanks, and 4-6 short answer questions. 

Homeworks were never particularly difficult. You can finish them in maybe 30-45 minutes max if you really concentrate and buckle down. 

She also has an awesome policy where you can either completely drop your lowest exam score, or downweight your lowest exam and your final. If you do well on all the exams (which you should try to do), then you can relax for the final. I think a lot of the people I knew only needed a D on the final in order to get an A, because they all did well on the midterms. 

Lab is a pain. I was in the honors version, which I think is better than the regular version because we didn't have as much work (in my opinion). We only had to do like 2 pre-lab quizzes, a presentation, and a few written assignments. I don't know if they will do this next time, but we also had 4 one hour long discussions spread out throughout the year. They were really chill and were an easy 15 points. 

My lab TA was AWESOME. I think that makes all the difference in your experience. 

Lab should bring up your grade. If you have the option to take the honors version, definitely do it. ",227
bely,4,A-,BSCI106H,"Bely is pretty funny and passionate, and she really tries to make the class interesting, but at the end of the day, I just didnt really enjoy the class. Her lectures are heavily based on her powerpoints, and while she does post them on elms, her exams require memorization of the most detailed examples on those slides. The final exam only repeated a few things, but it was much less detailed and easier to handle. I took the honors version, which meant our lab portion was different. While we didnt have to take the pre-lab quizzes, we had to write up a few reports and the TA are VERY VERY harsh graders. But, there were discussion points and other points which were just some gimmes. In the end, my lab portion gave me a 90%, and I worked pretty hard--I personally think it was so low because of the harsh grading and not the content.",227

That being said, Dr. Bely is a FANTASTIC professor. She is VERY clear about the topics. I have learned more in this class than any other class I have taken on campus. It is difficult, but truly worth your time and effort. You will never look at Biology/Ecology the same again. Life-changing course with Dr. Bely. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",227
bely,2,C,BSCI106,"A LOT of work. 4 exams, 1 practical, 1 or 2 lab reports (don't wait til last minute!), lots of lab work.

Bely only really reads off slides in lecture. Other than that you don't deal with her directly. It's really about whether you end up with a good TA or not. She seems enthusiastic but it just felt pointless to go to lecture sometimes because slides are online and pretty much follow the book.

Exams are DIFFICULT and cover a LOT of material at once. I studied for hours for DAYS and still couldn't get good exam grades. It's best to have taken BSCI105 or other related Biology classes before taking this class. BSCI105 is references a lot and I never took it so that made things hard. It's a weed-out class so it's more difficult than it really needs to be. ",227
bely,5,B,BSCI106,"Whoa! Don't listen to the bad reviews. They're plain naive. Dr. Bely is an amazing professor. I'm writing this review 2 semesters after taking Bely and I can honestly say she is one in a million. She cares about her students and keeps her lectures entertaining. She is more than willing to get to know every last student in her 300-kid lecture hall. There are other professors you will have to take who don't give fudge about your future, your grade, or anything about you.

The only reason she doesn't curve is because people do well in her class anyway! I found the class to be a bit too easy and slacked, which is why I got a B. But so long as you attend lecture, you can do well (and have fun).  ",227
bely,4,A,BSCI106,"First, Dr. Bely is an extremely passionate and witty professor who everyone likes as a person. The class can be a little tedious. It is certainly not her fault because the material is pretty dry. Exams do require a decent amount of memorization. This is the major drawback because I learn better with concepts, not memorization and regurgitation. I am not sure if this is consistent across all bsci106 classes. Overall, exams are not extremely difficult. Third exam will kill if you dont study/memorize. She drops an exam so theres no curve. Lab serves as your cushion, dont screw up. Overall, not bad at all. Also, if you got time, read the book. Its interesting stuff and also help for studying purposes.  ",227
bely,5,A,BSCI106,"Dr. Bely is a great professor - always enthusiastic and very interested in her students. This class does require a fair amount of memorization but, with review sessions before each test, Dr. Bely tries to help focus the notes into a slightly more condensed package. If you like biology definitely try to take Dr. Bely as she will help you have a deeper understanding of how species are related.",227
bely,5,A,BSCI106,"You have to be a moron to fail this class. The class average for the second exam was a 80%. For a science class, that's pretty damn high. For the final, she copied and pasted most of the questions from the previous exams. The solutions with keys were posted online! Also I never came to class after the second exam because all her lecture notes were typed up and posted on elms. It was better than terp notes. I was taking three labs with this class and it really saved me. I cut class all the time to get help on OChem and Physics. Posters need to learn how to study instead of *****ing. ",227
bely,4,,BSCI106,"What are people saying?? I honestly don't think this class is that hard. I struggled at the beginning of the semester for some reason. But the class average before the finals was about a 79% or 80%. That's why there's no curve! (I was pretty bummed myself when I found out). She has 3 exams and one is dropped, so it's really not that bad. I have to admit, the first two tests gave me a wakeup call, so I had to try really hard on the last exam. And it definitely paid off! You need to study, guys. Lectures are not the most exciting thing out there. It's in a powerpoint format and Dr. Bely posts the outline of them on elms for you. Take your notes, it's good. Then you can rewrite them (trust me, it helps) and annotate them. Don't know if anyone has tried this, but recording lectures also help. Yes, it's VERY time consuming to relisten to lectures. But if you're not a huge biology buff and it takes you a while to get information into your head, it's a good idea. Lectures are only 50 minutes long though. When you relisten, it helps so much. It reinforces what you learned in class and you can add even more little notes to your notes. It really helps. Skimming over readings has helped (but there is NO WAY you need to read everything. Honestly, I didn't do all the readings) and looking at figures that were on the outline helped. As for the third exam. I think it is the hardest, but it was my highest exam score. She told us to study those phylogenetic trees (I didn't realize that until I relistened to the lecture). So I sat down and redrew the phylogenetic tree OVER and OVER and OVER again until I got it right. And guess what? That same tree was on the test. Also, the reading from the third module from the lab manual will really help on the last exam. Final was easy. There were many questions from previous exams. Many of them were straight from previous exams. I didn't study as much as I wanted to for this final since I was stressing over other ones, but I got really lucky since those questions were from old exams. She posts the answer key to these exams online, so there is really no excuse for not getting them right. You need to study. Period. It's not a hard class if you do. Don't procrastinate. If you don't want to put a lot of effort into this specific class, don't take her. If you just study, you will definitely ace the class. I've seen many other students who have.",227
bely,1,,BSCI106,"Do not take this class! She literally expects you to memorize half the book in depth. She does NOT curve but she does drop the lowest test score, which still won't help you. She really doesn't care about her students. Her lectures are boring and she really isn;t helpful. My TA was a lot of help though. I asked my other friends in bsci 106 with another professors and he told me he didn't have to memorize much at all. Her exams are also a bit long. She can not teach for her life! For an example, you had to memorize a trillion different phylogenic trees, but she never went over them during lecture. She only went over them during one of the review sessions for an exam. And of course, most of the trees were on the exam. If you absolutely love animals and evolution and want to spend hours and hours studying for exams, take this class. if not, stay away! On the bright side, she was an approachable professor. 
",227
bely,3,C,BSCI106,"Class is based on a lecture and lab grade. Lecture includes 3 ""mid-terms,"" one of which is dropped, a final exam, two problem sets. Lab includes a lab report, lab quizzes, lab assignments, and a lab practical. Lecture 3 times a week, Lab once for 3.5 to 4 hours.

Pros: Good lecturer, keeps biology as interesting as it can really get. When absent, class isn't cancelled, she sends in a substitute. Posts outlines of lectures online (she says they don't have everyone on them that she covered in lecture but they never seem to be missing anything...)

Cons: A LOT OF CONTENT. Tons of notes to study for each exam, as well as a lot of reading that's hard to  keep up with, and lab notes.
-No review guides for tests. Just study ""everything""
-Bely doesn't really take into account that students have 4 or more other classes besides this one.
-Not very helpful.

mignerey,1,,CHEM271,"Unapproachable, constantly messes up on her powerpoint slides. Exams super unfair. TA messes up just as much in discussion. She's going to need to put a huge curve on this class to make up for all the bad grades her students are receiving. ",229
mignerey,2,,CHEM131,"Mignerey is a difficult teacher to get an A in. Don't follow the book religiously but more as a small supplement since her powerpoints are better. Her exams are a lot like the practice ones so be sure to do them. As a professor, she's not very good. Her answers aren't always clear and her explanations aren't always clear as well. I'll be following her explanation and then suddenly she makes some drastic jump that leaves everyone confused and wondering how to do the problem. She also does tend to get a little flustered when students keep asking questions. Don't rely on Mignerey for learning, go find a good study group or GSS session. ",229
mignerey,1,C-,CHEM131,"Honestly, she is a very nice lady outside of class, and I actually have never ever written a review about a professor before.

But I warn you, please please please don't take her as your professor. 

Every class she screws up at least one or two problems therefore making it incredibly hard for anybody to follow what she is saying, because if she is screwing it up how does she expect us to understand it?

If you try to ask a question she gets incredibly sassy and doesn't understand why you don't get what she is saying..probably because she doesn't even understand what she is saying.

If you want to actually learn concepts and understand the material and you HAVE to take her, don't go to class and just use the book.

But I would encourage all reading this that honestly, every class theres about 8 hands raised in the air and people are always looking around trying to see if anyone understands and what is going on, and the averages on the tests are embarrassingly low.

Don't take her. Ever.",229
mignerey,3,,CHEM131,"eh... her lectures are a little difficult to follow and annoying. there is a decent curve at the end of the semester but the final exam was unreasonably long an therefore difficult to finish in the 2 hour time frame. she does masteringchemistry which is helpful but other than that Id consider another professor for Genchem 1 if I were you. I get the feeling she's a much better professor for more advanced courses, genchem 1 just isnt her thing",229
mignerey,3,,CHEM131,"Mignerey is an interesting teacher to say the least. While you do not want to miss any lecture you also have to read in order to keep up. She blew past material really fast and also covers material that will not be on exams because she finds it interesting. In all seriousness, she is a very intelligent woman, but you have to have an interest in science in order to do well in her class.",229
mignerey,3,,CHEM131,"She's a fair teacher. Mignerey is not a bad teacher but she could have been better with her lectures. I didn't do good on the final. 

Con:
Her TA, I think he replaced Mara. His name is Paul Diss and he is a snob! He's impatient and has an attitude that could throw anyone off.You will find it hard seeking help from him. Don't ever deal with him but only if you don't got a choice",229
mignerey,1,,CHEM131,"To start in all fairness - this professor is smart in her own right. She studies nuclear chemistry which is quite advanced compared to the introductory Chem 131. So i can't review how she teaches other chem courses.

However! Even the smartest people can be the worst of teachers. Mignerey is one poor professor.

Her lectures are read off of less than descriptive power points. Her shinannagins in class result from her inability to demostrate concepts correctly.

Furthermore, asking questions to her in the middle of class is a joke. She gets mad so easily and instead of elaborating on a concept she just says ""it's like this right?...see right."" She assumes the student knows the very questioned they asked about, which is silly because then why would they ask.

The most frustrating part! In her minimal effort to explain things she uses her stupid catch phrase ""boot strap ourselves through it."" This is a cop out as a professor who is basically is using a poor analogy to explain a concept in chemistry. 

She also has some ghoulish henceboy named Paul Diss who has inhereted Mignerey's inability to teach effectively, not to mention her snotty attitude. These two combined really make  the class an uncomfortable learning environment because they are always looking down their noses at students. It's sad they functionally exist in a teaching capacity. 

Testing: The tests are probably equivalent to other chem131 courses in terms of difficulty, but the professor does little to provide fundamental information in a coherent manner. Her class averages are depressingly low. The results you see on this website are most likely used after <50% of the class drops the course. 

The TA's are the saving grace of Mignerey's career. Without them the class wouldn't do so well(minus the top percentile of students who just accel at   any class they take)

I wouldn't trust anyone who thinks this professor is good. Chances are they have a passion or understanding of chemistry already and rely little on the professor. Thy are basing their judgments off of the tests which is not a true reflection of the professor's teaching abilities. 

If you are a Chem major or interested in nuclear chemistry or anything close to that then this might be the professor for you.

If you are a student who needs to take Chem with a relatively different major and hope to be enlightened with coherent knowledge of the subject then you might want to take a different professor

mignerey,4,,CHEM271,"Dr. Mignerey is a pretty good professor. I found the material very interesting and you can tell she is really enthusiastic about what she does. She was pretty accessible and if you asked her intelligent questions she would answer you clearly. 

Her exams are kind of challenging. Averages for 2/3 of them were low and because of that there was a decent curve. The final was pretty hard so make sure you come prepared. The exams really do test how prepared you are and if you are not, your grade will pay. Final is 40% of your grade so make sure you take it seriously. 

You have to go to lecture because she has in-class quizzes that are an easy way to get points.

The TA, Mara, is phenomenal. She is very helpful in discussions. ",229
mignerey,4,,CHEM271,"All i know is after dropping chem with kahn this class is a breeze!! Seriously her exams are almost identical to the practice exams she puts up!!! Going to class is a must because there are ""quizzes"" which are 1 pt daily problems on notecards that you can work on with others.",229
mignerey,4,B+,CHEM131,"Make sure you understand the material when you come into lecture.  She'll point out all the little things you need to know but you have to go back to the book and read up on it, thankfully the book is really easy to understand.  

Her tests are basically what she gives you on the practice exams, understand the concepts, memorize the equations and you'll do well on the tests.  

Be wary she's not to approachable.  Yes she does want you to do well but it's best to understand when she raises her voice at you it's not because she's mad.  

I could have gotten an A in this class.  In fact I got an A on the final.  I wish she had a policy like Dixon's where if you get an A on the final you get an A in the class.  ",229

>Mignerey doesn't teach you concepts, Eichorn does.
>Mignerey puts everything in the powerpoint and everything is organized so she goes really fast over the material and loses a lot of her students in the middle. So, after she does every question, there would be 10 hands up by the students asking what she did. >Eichorn puts questions up, doesn't put steps up. Does on the board. So goes slowly. You get the concepts and understand how to approach the problem, and solve it slowly.
>Mignerey faces board and powerpoint while teaching. Eichorn faces you.

Her exams are interesting. She posts a practice exam along with an answer key, but when the actual exam comes, there are several questions that were talked about for one lecture slide.  Things like that make the averages of the exam around a 55.

Her exams are generally not too difficult if you do your part which means doing the ""optional"" homework and completing her practice exams. Before every exam she gives us a practice test which depicts EXACTLY what will be on the exam.

She is always open for office hours, and her powerpoints-style of lecturing is amazing.  If you miss a class it's fine, but better even that she highlights the MAIN concepts, and gives straight examples, so you know what the test will be like (exactly like the study guides).  Compared to Dr. Khan, whose averages hover around 50%, and he does concepts, Mignerey teaches by example, and if you attend every class, do the homework, and study hard the night before, and can memorize a few equations and use your brain to manipulate them on an easy 80 point exam, then TAKE Dr. Mignerey!",229

She isn't detailed in what she teaches which makes it hard to understand what's going on. She is not good at explaining the material. One question quizzes were given during lecture (meaning you had to go) and were quite frustrating. HW on TopHat and Chem101 were long and tedious and difficult( on Chem101). Tests were hard. It was a game of chance if the test was like the homework. It could be the same difficulty or easier, but sometimes the tests were much much harder than what we went over in class and the practice exams given.

It got so bad I ended up self teaching the class for the entire semester with a few friends. I will be the first to say I learned more from my study group than her teaching. 
Our 3rd exam had a massively low average. It was an outlier compared to the performance on our other exams. The only difference between the 3rd exam and the other ones was the fact that Dr. Mignerey made the questions. Instead of trying to understand what occured on her 3rd exam she decided to insult our section and justify why she placed every question on said exam.

She also was generally pretty good about communication, which I've realized is super important. Some other teachers don't respond to emails ever.
It's not a very tough class. If you're some who's solid at chem, you'll probably fly through this class pretty easily. If not, just try to pay attention in class, and (more importantly, I think) do the Homework. The HW is the exact same form and website as the tests, so questions are similar.

I got a 93 on the first exam and a B- on the second one due to mainly true and false errors. I ended up with a B+ in the course, since the final was hard. The weekly quizzes are easy and based off of examples quickly taught in lectures, even though they're supposed to be based off of the optional homework. The matlab projects are very straightforward.

Exams were similar to past semesters but about 2x the difficulty. I'd say studying the older exams would be your best bet.

long_terence,2,A,MATH246,"Terence was not my favorite professor, which is unfortunate because he has such high reviews so I had high expectations. My biggest gripe with him is that he lectures so slow, painfully slow. I understand that for some it's nice to have a slower paced professor so no one gets left behind, and Terence definitely does that. However, if you did understand the material the first or second time around, the third and fourth explanations aren't needed.

The slow pace of his lectures got to the point where we wound up 2-3 weeks behind Kendall Williams' 246 lectures (I know because my roommate took Kendall's section the same semester). 

The benefit of this is that the final exam covers much less material because you don't get to cover as much in the class. The downside of this is that I feel like I didn't actually learn anything. Terence teaches in a way where he gives you the exact steps to solve any problem so you always get the right answer. But gives zero explanation as to why those are the steps we take. So you can mindlessly solve a problem but only because you've memorized steps and in reality have no idea what you're doing (reminiscent of high school for me).

Overall the class with him is an easy A but you don't actually learn. So take him if you don't care for math and just need to pass to graduate or if you want to boost your gpa. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend. ",235

Her exams are something else though, they often mix different concepts into one question and it can get really tough. She tries to make questions seem relevant to real life, but this in turn makes questions confusing and wording a bit weird.

He actually taught the concepts, sometimes with no presentation at all. When he did use a power point, it was as a visual aid and not as a crutch.

For this semester, he did only quizzes (no midterm) and a final, plus homeworks. I liked the quizzes because it removed the stress of having a big midterm, however, it required you to always be caught up in the material.",240
deshpande,5,,CMSC724,A very good course and very good Prof. The course is quite extensive and well prepared covering the entire database concepts from basic to advance.

deshpande,1,,CMSC424,"This class as an online course has been horrible. The homeworks are absolutely killer and take 10+ hours a week to get done, if you can even figure them out at all. They’re usually 20+ questions and some programming assignment that the instructions are often unclear for. Multiple times during the homework it feels like during lecture we were taught how to do a doggy paddle and the assignment is like figure out how to swim across the Atlantic, good luck. The midterm was poorly done too, with 2 parts on elms being multiple choice and a writing section, timed. I truly feel like I haven’t learned that much and the homeworks are incredibly frustrating. Lectures are not great either and we have a synchronous time every week where we meet and he just repeats what’s on the slides from the videos we already watched. This class is very poorly organized and I would not recommend it to anyone due to the frustration and headache.",240
deshpande,1,C,CMSC424,"CMSC424 during the full covid semester is actually kind of absurd. The concepts build up extremely rapidly, but the extraordinarily difficult homeworks don't even cover material relevant to future jobs. If I ever have to calculate precisely how many hard disk seeks and block reads occur when running a SQL Hybrid Hash merge join operation in the worst case at a future job, I will actually eat my hat. The fact that homeworks ask us to effectively re-derive and analyze internal sql algorithms is a bit ridiculous for this semester. 

I made the mistake of not doing a couple early homeworks to make room for other classes, thinking the difficulty would be consistent throughout the semester. Turns out I need every point I can get in this class, and that's not really possible with how inscrutable and impossible the homeworks have become. ",240
deshpande,1,,,"Legit an extemely horrible class that has been poorly run during this fully online COVID semester. The homeworks are actually impossible to do good on since he barely even covers the concepts during lecture, and then on homeworks gives insanely detailed questions that not even the holy scriptures of the textbook cannot answer.

The midterm was extremely difficult and the class average was well below failing. The homeworks take an insane amount of time and scrutiny to complete, and I feel like I am walking out of this class as if I have learned nothing essentially.",240
deshpande,1,,CMSC424,"The lectures are worthless, the homeworks take 10+ hours to complete and even then getting good scores on them is extremely difficult, the exam was terrible and poorly managed, and I don't think I learned a single thing this semester other than some useful surface level fragments of information",240
deshpande,1,W,CMSC424,"First course I've ever had to withdraw from (3.9 GPA double major). Semester started off fine (SQL section was handled fairly) and veered completely off the rails into incomprehensible algorithms which were not well taught. Professor started off giving polls on certain concepts, but then didn't bother when it was really needed.

Homeworks regularly required us to sift through documentation, including learning procedural SQL (not covered in class), to low-level implementations of data structures and joining algorithms in Python. If I wanted to write shitty low-level code for 10+ hrs/wk I would have just taken Operating Systems. In addition, even though the professor gives 20 late days, the standard due date for homeworks is within 3-4 days, so it's not that big of a helping hand. I thought the HW in the later half of the course would be similar to the difficulty in the first half, and got screwed having to write those algorithms with limited time.

Midterm was filled with questions on highly specific concepts that were covered once in class. Average on Part 2 of the midterm was <50%. This midterm was also supposed to be taken closed note, but on the honor system. Any student who cheated probably gained a major advantage due to the specific nature of the questions.

Avoid CMSC424 online with Deshpande at all costs. This class singlehandedly made me switch out of Data Science into the Machine Learning track, and probably killed any interest I would have in Data Science at all, which was a shame since I really enjoyed CMSC320 and CMSC422.",240

As many other reviewers have noted, there's a definite disconnect between the lecture/slides/textbook and the homework at times. Most coding assignments are fairly easy, but worksheets can be very vague and often require office hours for clarification. Projects/worksheets take up about 75% of your overall grade and there is probably a minimum of a solid 8 hours of homework each week. It seems like the curve will be fairly generous and I believe this class is pretty hard to fail, but it's also far from a piece of cake.

Also, there's simply way too much material involved in this course. You jump from topic to topic week after week while it feels like you're really just skimming the surface.",240
deshpande,4,A-,CMSC424,"I believe this class is necessary for all computer science majors to take because it gives you an in depth overview about databases and the theories/concepts behind them. However, the real world will probably cover 20% of what you actually learn. Since it was the covid online semester, I appreciate Amol for having a synchronous call once a week to cover the panoptos for the week, but if you didn't watch the videos or have any questions the lecture is useless. There was a homework worksheet on gradescope and mini coding project due every week which did seem tough to finish at times (especially at the end of the semester) but he was lenient and gave us 20 late days for the whole semester while dropping some assignments. The midterms were very hard and the averages of them were on the low side, but the curve was extremely generous (80% is an A). He is responsive to concerns and was one of the more understanding CS professors that I have had. The only comment that I have is that there are so many topics that you feel you are zooming without really learning it in depth. But it is kinda impossible to fail this class since the curve is generous and if you show effort within each assignment, you are guaranteed to pass.",240
deshpande,2,,CMSC424,"I took this class when it was online during covid. It was a terrible format for the insane amount of information they expected to teach. The pre-recorded lectures were decent (towards the end it started getting to be too much), but the once a week live classes were just simplified re-iterations of the pre-recorded lectures and did not add much value except for the few classes the professor created polls to practice application of the material.

The professor tried to answer questions during class but often ran out of time because he was spending most of the time re-iterating the material. There was no clear guidance to use the textbook, but sometimes he would answer a student question by just saying to read the textbook.

Homeworks were way too long and sometimes vague in expectations. Exams were also too long to finish for the average person. There was an overall curve at the end that helped take into account the difficulty and effort required to complete all the assignments.

I think a lot of the material in the class is useful to know, but since there is SO much information, it's hard to take all of it in and pick out which specific things you should know for homeworks or exams. A good word to describe this class is ""overwhelming,"" but if you're prepared to consume an insane amount of information (with a decent amount of self study), then you could get a lot out of this class.",240

I have made some pretty poor mistakes on my tests and there are certain things I deserved. But also, I did get partial credit when I deserved it. I liked the tests since there were no multiple choice questions. Just four 25 point questions. The wording of the question may catch you off guard, BUT if you read very carefully, they are really not that hard to understand. You need to think outside of the box since they are not straight questions from your textbook, but she DOES cover the concepts in class. She lectures mostly by writing on the chalkboard and there aren't powerpoints for you. I think it's easier for her to draw and solve stuff on the board, then to give you a powerpoint of notes, but by writing on the board, she takes a little time to erase the stuff, which makes it seem as if there isn't enough time to cover all the material.

She goes into too much detail refering to higher levels of chemistry that is not needed, nor understood, for Gen Chem 1. OR, she doesnt go into enough detail. She tells us she wants us to understand the concepts, and be able to apply them in a challenging way--in other words, she words all her exams in the most difficult manner, and all other professors' exams are way easier. 

If you must take her, rely on the book. Its a fantastic source for CHEM131 and explains everything so well....and hope you get a fantastic TA like our class did. ",241
espindola,4,A-,BSCI103,really really sweet and so passionate about biology! she really wants you to learn about biology. She's very spunky and tries to make the class interesting. I will say though that she is a bit of a tough grader on the in-class worksheets which can actually hurt your grade and the questions on the test seem pretty arbitrary sometimes. Overall I liked her and I think she is a very very nice person who cares about her students.,242
espindola,3,B+,BSCI103,"Prof Espindola clearly cares about what she's lecturing, but her teaching style is ineffective. Additionally, the harshness of grading was surprising for an intro-level course for non-majors.",242
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM135,"Vedernikov is the BEST.

He's a nice guy and dealt with our obnoxious class. His exams are almost exactly like his old ones, so use those to study. He actually cares about his students so don't be scared of him. ",244
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM401,"Dr. Vedernikov is a very nice guy and a good professor. An 83% is an A. Just study his slides and go to class and you will do fine. Their is Homework due every 2 weeks. Questions very similiar to the homework problems and the old exams are on the exams. If you every need help understanding Inorganic Chemistry Dr. Vedernikov is very open to helping you be successful, just go to his office.",244
vedernikov,3,A,CHEM135,"His accent is kind of hard to understand, but if you pay close enough attention (don't sit in the back and browse facebook and actually pay attention), I'm sure you'll learn enough. I chose to not pay attention and just read the textbook. I found the textbook to be very helpful, and Verdernikov's slides are right from the book and pretty useful (though I still recommend reading). His tests are very easy, and if you read the book, you'll be fine. The curve (85%+ is an A) is very generous and shouldn't be hard to pass.",244
vedernikov,4,A,CHEM135,"Yes he has an accent, but you get used to it. I can't comment much on how good his lectures were since I didn't pay attention. However, he does explain anything you need to know well if you go to office hours. His old exams are also almost identical to his newer exams, so study those and you should be fine.",244
vedernikov,4,A,CHEM135,"His accent was my favorite part of this class. 
Dr. Vedernikov was definitely accessible, he had office hours every day, and always ended his classes with an invitation for students with questions to come up to him and ask. 
It was hard to stay focused in lecture sometimes - we would cover a lot of material and then he would sometimes have to rush through the last few slides.
The last five minutes of class were always characterized by loud shuffling noises from the 300 or so people all packing up their stuff while the professor was still lecturing, making it impossible to hear. 
We covered a ton of material for the third exam, which had a silver lining in preparing us for the final the next week. ",244
vedernikov,4,A,CHEM401,"Dr. Vedernikov is straight up awesome.

The first part of this class was centered around quantum mechanics and group theory, but he tries to make it as interesting as possible. From there, the class shifted into organometallic chemistry and catalysis, which is his area of research so he brings in a lot of modern day applications. 

Although his accent is a little tough at first you get used to it after the first week. And he's always willing to help if he was unclear about something. 
Exams are very fair, as in they never cover something you've never encountered in lecture or the homeworks - so go to class, do your work and you'll be just fine (oh, and the cutoff for an A is an 80%, which is good too). ",244
vedernikov,3,B,CHEM135,"For those complaining about the clicker questions, just make a friend, give them your clicker, and switch off going to class. The homework on MasteringChem was easy (most of the answers are on yahoo answers) and if you get enough correct, you can get over 100%. The tests were okay, and I didn't pay attention AT ALL in class, just self-studied from the textbook/his powerpoints. For not paying attention in class and being sick and absent for three weeks, I thought a B was pretty good. This class is MUCH easier than Dixon's class, I always felt bad when my friends in her class were studying and I was doing nothing. 
I took AP chem in high school, and that class was much harder than this one (might be just my school) but I didn't remember much and still did well.
Oh also his office is impossible to find. But he was really nice when I had to make-up an exam.

tl;dr: Homework answers can be googled, you can self-study and do okay, if you actually pay attention in class an A is pretty easy, MUCH MUCH easier than Dixon.",244
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM135,"He seems like a nice guy. Never really paid attention in his class but the workload is very light. He gives so much opportunities for extra credit like in homework which is masteringchemistry gives 13 but only counts 10 and in clicker points where he gives 50 but only counts 40. Most of the material I learned myself since I tend to fall asleep in his class since I don't keep up. He posts past exams and the final which is very similar to the tests that he gives out. Overall, just take him if you're not doing anything chemistry related in engineering. Easy A for you.",244
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM135,"Vedernikov was a fabulous teacher.  Aside from the accent, which you can understand relatively quickly and easily, and his ""g"" looking like a ""p"" there is nothing really to complain about him.  He utilizes both powerpoints and blackboard.  The powerpoints will have definitions, pictures, and examples, but then elaborates on those things by writing more definitions on the board, explaining things with his own drawings, and doing more examples on the boards. All of that is really helpful in better understanding the material.  However, despite his good notes, you do need to actually read and take notes on your own (I know, it's a shocker) because it will give you a better understanding of everything and if you do it before the lectures you will be prepare to actually sit and listen rather than just sloppily copy down notes.  Overall, he has been my favorite professor so far, even though this is my first semester here, so the lesson to be learned is; pay attention in class, and do work on your own outside of class, namely take your own notes, and then you can easily get an A in the class.",244
vedernikov,2,C,CHEM135,"I took CHEM135 because I need it for engineering.  Vedernikov sucked.  I took AP Chemistry last year as a Senior in high school, and I ended up getting a B+ in the class but only a 3 on the AP exam.  I came in expecting for the class to be an easy A because I was told it was basically going to be a review of AP Chem.  The first thing I noticed about Vedernikov is that he has a thick Russian accent and that he speaks quietly, even with the microphone it's hard to hear his if you are any further back than a third of the way from the front.  He has all the material on the powerpoints he does in class and he posts them on ELMS after (or sometimes before) class.  He has at least 1 clicker question in class and about halfway through the semester he started to do a clicker question at the beginning AND end of class, so you have to stay for all of class to answer all the clicker questions.  You really cannot afford to miss any (or many) lectures, though what a friend of mine and I did towards the end of the semester was one person would take both clickers each day and the other person could relax and not go to class.  I must say though, I do like his grading scale.  I got a 77, 71, and 53 on my tests (in order of test 1, 2 and 3.  I admit I could have gotten better if I studied and paid more attention) but I ended up getting a 105.7 out of 100 on my homeworks, so that helped balance out my grade b/c he has a points system (best 40 clicker questions counted at a point each per right answer, .5 points per wrong answer, lowest three homeworks dropped out of 13 homeworks (counted at out of 100 points) and 100 points each for the three tests.  that plus the 200 point final adds up to 640 points).  His grade range is pretty nice too, 85%+ for an A, 75%+ for a B, etc. and he said he curved max two points up on the final grade.  Overall, I would not recommend him for Chem135.",244
vedernikov,3,B,CHEM135,"I ended up with a B because I didn't study. It is not difficult to get an A in his class. Vedernikov posts his old exams on ELMS and if you study and understand them, then you'll do fine on his tests. He does have an accent, but by the end of the first week you'll understand him just fine. He has clicker questions, which means you have to attend class. His class is also extremely boring, but he does allow the use of laptops in class, so you can get other work done. He is an easier teacher than Dixon, so if you don't really care about learning chem and just want a good grade, then take his class.",244
vedernikov,1,,CHEM135,"My ""OurUM"" account is dedicated to the famous Mr. Vedernikov. 
AKA worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. 
Has he been fired yet?",244
vedernikov,2,C,CHEM135,"Vedernikov has many problems as a professor.  He gives practice exams which are great to study from for each exam, but when you get the actual test there are questions that are not featured on the practice.  Its not that problems were different, the whole concept was missing.  He just does a poor job of preparing students for tests.  The accent depends on the person because sometimes I could understand him and other times I couldn't.  If you take CHEM 135 with Vedernikov be prepared for grueling exams and terrible lectures",244
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM131,"Prof. Vedernikov is a pleasant professor who cares about his students. He responds to emails quickly. Don't worry about his accent; it's completely understandable. 
The exams are extremely do-able since they are nearly identical to the previous years' exams (which he posts on Blackboard). The online homeworks aren't too bad. It isn't too hard to get an A (85% and above) or a B (75% and above).",244
vedernikov,4,B,CHEM131,"The class overall isn't that hard. If you took high school chem it's about the same material. When I had him an A>85, B>75.. and so forth. It's a pretty fair class; you get what you put in. 
But if you have him for an 8am its brutal. He talks with an accent and has a monotone voice so you have to be somewhat alert.
If you can avoid taking him at 8 do it. But overall he isn't a bad professor.",244
vedernikov,2,c,CHEM131,He had an accent so I was not always able to understand him.  His handwriting was horrible so if you didnt understand what he said would would also not understand what he writes on the board. My TA was great and did a wonderful job of explaining the concepts.,244
vedernikov,5,A,CHEM131,"I didnt find that his accent was much of a problem, tho he does tend to talk a bit softly, so do sit near the front. His exams were EXACTLY like those of past years, just with different numbers. The curve is also quite generous. Homework was a bit annoying, but easy. As some have said, sometimes his explanations are not the best, but hopefully you will have a good TA, mine last semester was great. Most of the time, though, stuff was pretty clear, and discussion was unnecessary. The professor himself was very approachable, and was just very sweet and uber helpful. I most def recommend him.",244
vedernikov,4,B,CHEM131,"Like most other reviews have said, Vedernikov is a pretty decent teacher.  His accent isn't too bad, and his practice exams are really helpful to prepare for the real ones.  However, if you aren't really a science/math person, this class might be somewhat challenging.  I put a lot of work into the course and maintained a B.  And also I almost never took notes in lecture because he tends to go all over the place; I took notes from the book (following the topics covered in the syllabus lecture schedule).",244
vedernikov,4,B,CHEM131,"Like others have said, his accent is slightly distracting and his handwriting can be difficult to read at times. However, his exams are extremely easy, his class is graded on a curve, and 3 of the lowest hw grades, 10 clicker questions are dropped.  ",244
vedernikov,4,B,CHEM131,"Really nice guy, pretty good professor. His lectures/notes are kind of disorganized; also his handwriting can be kind of difficult to read. His accent, for me at least, took some getting used to. Sit near the front and you'll do better understanding him and reading his writing. An 85 is an A and a 75 is a B which is nice. He drops the 3 lowest of 13 homeworks. The homework isn't usually too hard, just annoying to do. I don't really feel like I understand chemistry all that well after his class, but it really doesn't matter because I'm a business major. Partly it's probably because I didn't put in all that much effort. He posts a practice exam online before each exam, and it's basically the same as the exam, just with different problems. My only issue was that I felt after each test that I had done really well and then I usually found that I had scored ~10 pts lower than I thought, for whatever reason. Go to every lecture--there's clicker questions. I often slept through my 8 am class and missed the CQs, bringing my grade down.",244
vedernikov,3,A-,CHEM131,"Professor Vedernikov is a good professor. He is friendly towards his students. But, his lectures are a little disorganized. The notes he writes on the blackboards are sometimes all over the place, so sometimes it is hard to follow what he is writing or saying. Usually, he likes to use a lot of examples to explain what certain terms mean, but I wish he would give us the definitions first rather than going straight to examples to make it more understandable. 

The exams are fairly easy as long as you review the sample exams because they are very similar. There's a 5 point bonus question at the end of every exam. 

Clicker questions at the start of class every morning are easy because he explains what they are going to be before we actually answer them. They are based on what we learned at the last lecture.

The online homework is tedious, and he drops the lowest 3 out of 13 total. ",244
vedernikov,4,A,CHEM131,"Vedernikov is a really nice professor, he really seems to care about his students, and he answers emails very quickly. The class doesn't have a curve, however that's only because an A=85% and above and a B=75% and above. The tests are easy, and are exactly the same as the practice exam that he posts. The only problem is lectures. His accent is totally understandable, there are no problems there, however you have to go to every lecture because he gives clicker questions every single class. So I usually go and then fall asleep. The homeworks are easy, just use your textbook, the answers are like directly in there. If you want a A take Vedernikov.",244
vedernikov,4,,CHEM131,"Even though Vedernikov may not be the best lecturer, he gets concepts across to the students.

vedernikov,3,A,CHEM131,"Overall, the class wasn't too hard. There were three midterms, online homework, clicker questions, and a final. I didn't ever take notes in class, I just read the book.

The only good thing about his class is that his tests are fairly easy, but the class doesn't have much of a curve compared to other professor's classes and since he doesn't teach the material well, having easier tests doesn't go too far...",244

so you can listen to the students with the  expected grade A that say hes awesome. or you can listen to the failing student complain about the work... point is He's a good teacher if you pay attention and take notes. the homeworks can be really hard and the exams are pretty easy. if you have a 85% thats' an A. if u have a 75% thats a B..  etc. hope this helped.

vedernikov,1,,CHEM131,"He does not explain concepts very well. It would best if you can take your own notes, and practice problems at the end of each chapter.

I have also found that this year's exam are much much harder than last years.",244
vedernikov,4,A,CHEM131,"I agree with most of what LHaggerty said. He sometimes strays during the lecture onto somewhat related tangents which eat up valuable lecture time. On the positive side, he makes sure to explain difficult concepts in different ways to clarify things. His accent becomes easy to understand after about 10 minutes, so do not let a foreign accent discourage you. He was fair and friendly in dealing with me when I missed an exam.

It is annoying to have to purchase a 40$ clicker and OWL access to do the graded assignments. He grades attendance and the homeworks can be long and tedious. 

I would recommend, as it can be an easy A.",244
vedernikov,3,A,CHEM131,"Approachable and friendly, I found him relatively easy to understand despite his accent.  Gives online homework assignments that help a lot when test time comes around and it's easy to score well on these if you put in the time.  Tests are very reasonable if you take advantage of the practice tests he posts.  Participation points are earned by attending lectures and answering a clicker question at the beginning of class.  Lectures are not particularly clear, so it's best to take your own notes and go to lecture as review of your notes and to pick up extras not in the book.",244

He puts our arbitrary project specs without public/release tests and then tests them in a very specific way, causing many students to get zeros for things such as putting a space in the wrong place in the output. He said he would fix this, but I still have no idea what grade I have in this class.",247
marsh_michael,1,,CMSC414,He is the worst professor. Just reads off the slides and gives like 4 15 minutes excercises in class. Doesn’t give answers to these exercises.

He doesn’t have time for his students. 1 hour of office hours per week and that too for 414 and 417 combined.i am not sure what grade i have in this class. Extremely unorganized professor.

>He is bad at communicating
>His project descriptions are borderline unfollowable
>He only holds one office hour a week that is shared between 417 and 414
>His test grades are almost always wrong and you have to ask him for points back every time
>His grading is completely opaque unless you bug him for his inputs
>He forces you to use elms discussion boards and does not respond to any student questions posted to elms
>His lectures do not cover exam topics, they just give general, high level explanations of things
>He does not understand the math behind cryptography but tries to teach it anyway
>If you take him, you will learn everything on your own DURING the test
>He gives assignments that take much longer to complete than he says they will (his catch phrase is ""30 minutes of coding per problem"")

marsh_michael,1,B,CMSC414,"Worst computer science professor I've ever had at UMD. He puts this university to shame, and the worst part is - he's a pretty nice guy (it's so frustrating).

- lectures are downright impossible to follow
- he gives high-level explanations and then tests on low-level code implementation
- his take home exams require the use of libraries/tools that have bad documentation
- his take home exams are heavily biased towards students who have already taken cmsc417/cmsc456
- warning: if he gives take homes, prepare to devote 20-30 hours of work to it and watch the average be a 40-60%
- his grading scripts are terrible and you always need regrades
- he uses elms discussion boards instead of piazza
- he's stubborn, unhelpful, and oblivious in general

marsh_michael,1,F,CMSC414,I agree with everyone else,247
marsh_michael,1,,CMSC417,"Such a terrible teacher for 417. Exams and projects are so vaguely worded. You need to make several assumptions on exam questions, but if your implementation doesn't match his you get a 0. When we asked for clarifications, he would sometimes give us misleading answers. He never gave us sample input/output even though we asked before every project and exam. Half way through the semester he just gave up on doing slides. Grading felt like it was arbitrary, but he told us not to worry about it because he promised a substantial curve. He ended up setting 39 as the cutoff for a C-, but an 85 was still a B, so he might as well have not curved. He also gives out minuses but not pluses.",247
marsh_michael,1,,CMSC414,"Project grades are always off by at least 20% because he trusts his ""scripts"". Exams are tough, hard to study for. And everything else is as other reviews described. Terrible professor.",247
marsh_michael,5,A,CMSC417,"Marsh for 417 was great. He took a systems approach to the whole class which I really liked. If you didn't like 216 then you'll have a rough time, but projects are easy as long as you can read manpages and use Wireshark. It's impossible to fail his class if you submit even a half-assed attempt on all the projects. All exams including the final were take-home. If you don't get an A in the class it's on you",247
marsh_michael,4,A-,CMSC417,"Overall Professor Marsh was a much better professor than I think most of these reviews suggest. He has made changes based on what I hear on here. He no longer does take home exams which seemed to have been a major issue in past semesters based on past reviews and reddit threads. He is well prepared for lectures, and genuinely seems to care about students' success. He offers a survey active all semester for students to voice their opinions of the course, and he even sent individual messages to the students who did really well on each exam congratulating them on their success which was a nice way to show he actually cares about students doing well, which is really rare among professors here in my opinion. His grading scripts can be frustrating and his lack of public tests is something that I think could be improved, but overall he is not a bad professor. Class is pretty hard, but you learn a lot about how the internet works which is pretty cool.",247
marsh_michael,5,A-,CMSC417,"Based on past reviews, I was extremely weary to take Marsh for this class, but after going through it I’m glad I did. He has improved a ton and takes constructive criticism in stride to actually improve the class (the only cs prof I’ve seen do this). Many complain his test scripts are still broken, but these were due to tests that are more in depth than other courses, which I believe is a great thing. You can also tell he loves the subject. His lectures can be a little tough to follow at times as his examples aren’t always the clearest, but he is willing to reexplain anything that may have been ambiguous. Overall, the most useful class I’ve taken at UMD and no regrets on Marsh. ",247
marsh_michael,4,B,CMSC414,"Marsh was fine (clearly knowledgeable, willing to take feedback, friendly in office hours), but he insisted on spending the entire class reading from his slides from behind the podium, almost totally still.  The room tended to be dim, and his voice was steady and soothing. . .

Overall, I'm not going out of my way to take Marsh again, but he's not a dealbreaker.",247
marsh_michael,5,A+,CMSC420,I think his previous reviews were when he was a very new professor. He has definitely improved a lot since then. He is one of the best CS professors I have had at Maryland.,247

He was truly nice and understanding. Responded quickly and helpfully to questions. I also had read that he used to live and die by his automatic grading system. That is no longer the case and is more than willing to go in manually and re-grade something, even if it was your fault for misformatting some output.",247

It would take great effort or supreme procrastination for one to do poorly in Marsh's CMSC420 section. Highly reccomend. ,247
marsh_michael,5,A,CMSC420,Really responsive and well prepared for online lecture,247
marsh_michael,4,B,CMSC420,"Really good professor, but he uses Jason's projects and he hasn't read the src code so you won't ever know how your code gets tested. He'll review your code from a theory pov, however his mini-exams every week and his lecture videos are perfect.",247
marsh_michael,1,,CMSC414,"Does not help you prepare for exams whatsoever. What's the point of showing us previous exams with no answers?

marsh_michael,4,B,CMSC414,"Dr. Marsh was a pretty solid professor.  He was really accommodating during the pandemic and tried to make things as easy for us to understand given the circumstances.  While I had some complaints about the tests and the format of the material, he was helpful in clarifying any confusion and was really open to hearing suggestions for how to teach the course virtually in the future.  The projects for 414 were really fun and interesting, but also challenging and really made you think about the code rather than just mindlessly typing.  He also was flexible with regrade requests on projects and exams, which probably saved my grade when I realized later on that something was wrong.  ",247
marsh_michael,2,B+,CMSC414,"Although Dr. Marsh was nice and a lenient regrader, I found his lectures and in-class exercises to be very boring and unintuitive.  All content lectures were pre-recorded, and during our actual class time, we would ask him questions and watch him do exercises.  He explains concepts in high level terms that make it difficult to understand as a student who is learning about cybersecurity for the first time.  I would ask him questions about certain topics so that I could better understand them, but it became a chore as the semester went on.  He is very smart and knows a lot about the concepts that he teaches, however I was able to better understand these concepts by watching youtube videos that covered them.  Homeworks and exercises, while intellectually challenging, taught me more about how to navigate unix systems and find bugs than about computer and net security.",247
marsh_michael,5,B+,CMSC420,"I had Professor Marsh for CMSC420. Previously, I had him for CMSC414 and did not have a great experience. This time I thought that he did a much better job in how he taught the material and the assignments that were given in class. The projects and exams were very reasonable and it was one of the better upper level computer science classes that I have taken so far. ",247
marsh_michael,5,A,CMSC420,His recorded lectures are easy to understand and go over. His exams aren't too bad. Projects can be tricky given how much he tests on edge cases. Overall a pretty good professor and really understanding.,247

In 414 he gave us previous exams but would straight up refuse to answer or ignore us if we asked what the answer was. Rushes thru slides and expects us to know every single small detail about a topic, but at the same time will assign homeworks and projects that barely have anything to do with what he tests you on. Also in 420 he made exams super long for no reason, you wouldn't have finished unless you used other resources or asked your friends for help or saw the exam beforehand.

 Avoid him, you and your GPA will thank me later.",247
skuja,1,B,PHYS161,"Horrible professor. He seems like a nice dude, but he is the worst lecturer I have ever seen. Has no idea how to teach properly. He just does problems and mumbles about while trying to solve them. He doesn't explain well at all. If you didn't take AP physics in high school, you'll be totally lost. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",248
skuja,1,A,PHYS161,"Bad teacher. You will most likely not do well if you did not take AP Physics in high school. 

Even having taken AP Physics in high school, I had to put in a lot of work to pull off an A. His exam questions are basically taken directly out of the book. My strategy was that if I did most of the problems in the book, I would be prepared when I saw the same question on the exam. This strategy seemed to work, and I recommend it. 

Btw, the final exam is insanely difficult. You will feel like you failed, but there is some ridiculous 20 point curve because everyone fails it. ",248
skuja,1,AB,PHYS161,Pretty bad teacher. Not much homework. The materials not impossible to learn on ur own.You'll learn nothing in lecture.,248
skuja,1,C,PHYS161,"THE WORST PROFESSOR EVER. You sit in lecture, and think ""why the eff am I here?"" The examples he gives in class are ridiculously easy and he spends too much time going over them. The exam problems, then, are NOTHING like ANYTHING he goes over in lecture. I stopped going to class because I wasn't getting anything out of them.

I'm pretty sure I would have gotten a worse grade in the class if I had actually gone. Instead, during lecture times I self-studied or did the Mastering Physics. Seriously, skuja is a horrible teacher, do anything you can not to take his class. 

Honestly, he's probably a smart guy with a lot of knowledge, but he does not know how to teach at all. Avoid at all costs. ",248
skuja,1,C-,PHYS161,"Terrible Professor. He basically screwed up on the first exam because the average was a 90, and now he's going to compensate for it by normalizing the grades. Going to class is useless and exams (other than the first) are so obscure and ridiculous. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",248
skuja,1,,PHYS161,He is a nice guy but not very good at teaching. Out of 300 of people in the class maybe 50 go to class. You really need to teach yourself in order to do well in the class.

skuja,4,,PHYS103,"This is the lab class for PHYS102, but the lab and the lecture have little to nothing in common. The ExpertTA was decent but sometimes had typos in it that resulted in losing points on questions. For example: ""Question 1: What's the lowest frequency the ear can hear?"" Chose the correct answer. ""Question 1: What's the lowest frequency the ear can hear?"" Chose the same answer as before (because it was the same question) and eventually find after losing all possible points that Q2 was meant to ask about the highest frequency. The TA (not Skuja, was Clayton Ristow) was helpful during the class. Labs were sometimes too abstract and didn't have enough background available to make them make a lot of sense. ",248
skuja,1,,PHYS260,Avoid at all costs! Lectures were absolutely useless but you still had to go to them every week because he gave us two quizzes every single week. We had two lectures and one discussion per week and in two of those we had a quiz. We didn’t have time to learn anything new before being quizzed and getting the same things wrong again and again. ,248
o'brien_tammatha,5,A+,BSCI222,"Dr. O'Brien is very kind and wants to make sure you understand the material. Her exams are very conceptual, try to understand the bigger picture when studying, and then focus on the smaller details. She has past exams uploaded, they are very helpful and gives you a sense of what to expect for the exam. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Lab practicals are also very conceptual. Make sure you understand how different systems connect, and you will get an A!",250
o'brien_tammatha,5,,HESP305,"Wonderful lecturer - very intelligent and has interesting things to add about the lecture. She is super nice about grading and permitted students to turn in homework a little after it was due. 

I wish there was a better way to take notes in this class. She asks you to print out each lecture's PPTs, which feels expensive and wasteful, and typing on the PDF is simply less effective for note taking. I wrote the slide page number in the margins of my notebooks and took notes per slide, but that was cumbersome. Perhaps 2 PPTs, 1 super in depth and 1 more basic, would be good. However, this does stop you from needing to buy the textbook! I wish she had said in the syllabus or at the first lecture that we didn't NEED it so I could have saved money but it's really nice that she does that. 

I liked the group project (group of 4-5, short presentation) and the muscle quizzes (8 of them, do them on your own time, 5 attempts per) but did not love the Tuesday quizzes. They were sometimes a little too hard or very specific even though she lets you have a 3x5 card for each quiz. 

You're allowed an 8.5x11 in sheet of paper (front and back, handwritten) for each exam. Exams vary - you need to have the big picture of concepts. Know vocab, even the stuff she didn't really emphasize in class. ",250
o'brien_tammatha,4,A+,BSCI447,"Dr. O'Brien is very entertaining and outgoing. It's an easy class to participate in and she's very easy to talk to. This makes it really easy to get a letter of rec as long as you go to her office hours and participate she'll write you one. 
I personally did not see her intelligence come through in this class. Everything was prepared in advance and the material was repetitive to a fault. She doesn't give any info outside of the slides which makes paying attention in class difficult. There was very minimal critical thinking in this class and I found myself on cruise control for majority of it. But the material was interesting and it's easy to do well.",250
o'brien_tammatha,4,B,HESP305,"The lecture videos were very fast paced and a lot of information gets covered in each so I had to watch them more than once which took up a lot of extra time. All of the info for the quizzes comes straight from the textbook so unfortunately it was a necessary purchase. A lot of study time was required to do well on the exams even though they are open note because of the time limit. If you're a HESP major, you have to take this class so just get through it. ",250
o'brien_tammatha,2,,BSCI222,"Good lecturer. One thing that really made me not rate her higher was her lack of empathy. Taking an online exam I accidentally hit the ""submit"" button instead of the ""next page"" button and she would not allow me to reopen the exam. Ended up losing out on like 30 points from an exam and she could not have cared less. Totally ruined my grade for the class. I understand that its a large class and that catering to every student may be difficult, however it still sucks that the one time I needed to ask her a question all year, she blatantly disregarded me and refused to help.",250
plane_jandelyn,5,A,CMSC131,"I have no idea why people are saying she's a bad teacher. If you aren't a bright person you aren't gonna do well in computer science, the material isn't easy to comprehend.

That being said, I had never programmed going into college and got a 100 on every single project.  Jan hooks it up in office hours and bumped my grade when I was borderline.

Make sure you practice writing code on paper or it will hurt you come exam time, which is the only reason I needed a bump.  jan is a great lecturer, teacher and person.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,B-,CMSC131,"She's nice, but her examples in lecture are terrible. If you're obsessed with cats you'll love her because every single example she gives in class deals with cats. The projects are also very different from what she teaches, if you expect her examples to help you on projects you're wrong, and the lectures aren't very helpful towards teaching the concepts of the class. If you go to discussion, though, the TAs are actually really helpful and teach in a much simpler way than Jan.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,A,CMSC122,"She is very nice and tried very hard (saw her a couple times at office hours), but just didn't teach the stuff well. One problem is the class doesn't really have homework. She expects us to create situations that we would use the code. In a normal comp. sci class that could fly, but this is an intro class! Anyway the material wasn't that hard, but I had to teach myself everything, which made it harder. A+ for my TA though (I don't know if shell be there next semester)",251
plane_jandelyn,2,B+,CMSC122,"The class itself is not hard. Unlike what the person below me had said, I had no problems when it came to midterms (92.2% avg), projects (99% avg), or the labs that I had done at home with very little difficulty. I have previous programming experience in MATLAB from PHYS165 so most of aspects of the class were already familiar to me and I had no difficulty adapting to slightly different terms and methods. If you know MATLAB, you should be fine.
However, you should be aware of the fact that many of the students with 0 experience had a very hard time. Some did not do well on exams, needed help on projects, and were continually relying on the TAs to dig them out of holes.
With that said, Plane is completely unresponsive to student concerns. In one case, i had an issue that I had contacted her about. She replied very promptly and I thought we had resolved it, but she took no action. So I contacted her again. And again. And again. No reply, no action taken. Because of her lack of activity and willingness to help, I'll be getting an entire letter grade lower because the issue at hand was worth about 8% of the total point breakdown. If this doesn't convince you that she doesn't care about your concerns, I don't know what else to tell you.
If you have a definite need to take this class with Plane, I suppose you don't have a choice... However, if you get another professor, you're probably in better hands.",251
plane_jandelyn,2,C,CMSC122,"I am currently taking this course with Plane, and I would like to say that she is a very kind woman and really does want to see her students succeed, however wanting to help them succeed and actually doing it are two different things. You will struggle in this course if you have no prior Computer Science experience, which is why I took the class. As others have said before, in her  other computer science courses her lectures are so basic that when it comes time for quizzes and tests you have no idea what to do. Not to mention she only gives 10 minutes to do these quizzes which are too complicated for a class at this level. The tests were equally as difficult and on more than one occasion almost the entire class did not finish on time.

As soon as you get to JavaScript you better hope that you don't fall behind or else your grade will be ruined. Don't expect your TAs to help you either because they don't speak English.

As for projects they are also extraordinarily complicated for what you learn in the class. There is no way you can do these without help and I recommend starting them as soon as they are assigned. There are weekly ""In class labs"" that are supposed to help you do these projects and understand the material better, but after the first week of class she leaves you to do them on your own with no help.

She is a very nice woman but do not take this class if you want an elective and are new to Computer Science, you will most certainly regret it. You can learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your own for free without being so brutally penalized.",251
plane_jandelyn,5,,CMSC250,"I know this is late but I had her for 250 over the summer. I was a little scared because I've heard crazy mixed reviews, but there is nothing to be afraid of. She is very kind and helpful but most importantly she wants her students to succeed. She knows that the material can be confusing so she goes over it and makes sure the class understands before moving onto the next unit. 

What I really love about her is how approachable she is. She had set office hours but I sometimes showed up at her office randomly and she still was happy to help. 

She is really helpful about exam grading too. She will explain to you why you got the grade you did and will negotiate with you if you don't think you deserved it. There was one time I misread a question and would have lost a lot of points but I explained that to her and she let me rewrite my answer.

She is overall a very understanding and caring professor. She made 250 a fun class (like we were doing puzzles rather than long boring proofs). I recommend her not only as a professor but also an adviser (you can ask her about anything!)  ",251
plane_jandelyn,1,C,CMSC131,"This course was absolutely horrid. This was my first time learning to program and I made a mistake taking it with Plane. She is extremely confusing, boring, and her voice just makes me want to tune her out. Her examples and analogies don't make any sense, either, which causes me to become even more confused.

The lectures were such basic material that when it came time for the quizzes/projects, I struggled. Quizzes are given every week and for the little amount of time given, the concepts were so much more difficult compared to the labs and the lecture examples. She cannot expect us to understand something at a higher level if she cannot even teach us the basic examples, especially for a beginner Java class (where most students in my lecture had no prior programming experience). The projects were also substantially more difficult than any of the examples ever given in class. Even those with prior programming experience found them to be a little difficult. 

My TA was also horrible. She was so snappy and anything she wrote on the board could not even be seen .. GET BETTER MARKERS PLEASE. She never spoke loud enough for me to hear and was snappy whenever a student asked a question.

However, those with previous programming experience had no trouble in this course. J. Plane basically catered to those who already knew Java ..

I am a CompSci major and this bad experience has caused me to reevaluate my choice of major. Hopefully 132 with Fawzi will change my mind.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH J. PLANE IF YOU HAVE NEVER PROGRAMMED BEFORE. ",251
plane_jandelyn,2,,CMSC131,"Sorry to say this, but I feel like this course would be more appropriately titled ""introductory minutia of Java syntax."" I greatly enjoyed all of the programming assignments, but to be honest, I found the course material extremely frustrating and unenlightening because there was an overwhelming focus on Java's syntactical conventions, rather than the conceptual basis for the object-oriented programming paradigm. All in all, this wasn't a bad course, but I think the content could be a lot better. 

Unfortunately, Jan also took a rather parental tone towards her students in this class. I'm sorry, I tried, but was unable to find her explanatory metaphors very compelling :( ",251
plane_jandelyn,5,A+,CMSC131,"At first I wasn't sure what I thought of Jan. I've definitely never had a professor with her style of teaching and communication. That being said, I thought she did a great job teaching 131. Here's why:

1) She is VERY approachable outside of class and is really good at clarifying stuff 1 on 1. If you don't understand a lecture she could probably explain it all to you in a matter of 10 minutes if you're bright.

2) She explains stuff and demonstrates what she's talking about by coding in front of you in lecture. It necessarily make the material easy, per se, but it definitely makes it a lot easier to visualize and understand.

3) She has a PhD in both Comp Sci AND Education so she knows what she's doing.

4) She curved both of her midterms this semester.

Honestly, she's probably one of the best professors I've had at Maryland yet. Here's the rub, however, with CMSC131:

If you're not logically inclined (and honestly not exceptionally bright...there's no point in lying to yourself) you're going to really struggle with this class. That being said, Jan is definitely your best option because of her approachability outside of class.

Regardless of that fact, I thought Jan was a great professor and I would highly recommend her for CMSC131.",251
plane_jandelyn,5,A,CMSC131,"I had taken computer science classes in high school, but hadn't learned some of the material taught in the 2nd half of the course. 

I thought Jan was a great teacher. If you came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about java, then I can see how this class could be very difficult. I know a lot of people got C/Ds on the quizzes. 

Anyway, the use of projecting Eclipse onto a large screen really helped. Unlike some reviewers mentioned from past years, she only used a few pointpoints near the end of the course. And Piazza was great for communication.

I came in dreading this class b/c of these bad reviews, but I thought it was pretty bearable. ",251
plane_jandelyn,4,A,CMSC216,"I thought that Jan was a good professor who did an excellent job explaining confusing concepts in Lecture.  All lecture slides are available online, and she also posts many coding examples that make life a lot easier when it comes to doing the projects and studying for the exams.  In office hours she is friendly and willing to help.  
The class definitely is a lot of work, but just avoid procrastinating and you should do fine.  For many of the projects extra credit is offered if you pass all of the public tests by a certain day, so definitely start early and take advantage of this option. There were also office hours from 10-6 every weekday, so if you are stuck on project just go to the TAs and they will usually clear up the problem for you.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,,CMSC216,"Jan is a very nice and knowledgeable professor. Because of the nature of the course, she has to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time so blanking out for even a minute will leave you lost for the rest of lecture.

She's not one to care if you're messing around on the internet during lecture (as long as you're not disruptive to the rest of the class) but I highly suggest you pay attention. One of the most efficient ways to study for this class is to attend and understand the lectures - and this is only a quarter of the work.

This class is curved around an average of 75, despite what she might say about only ever curving 2-3% ... this is a lie.

Quizzes - She says ""you are always to expect a quiz in discussion"" but she really only gives them about once a week or every 10 days. The topics are never announced but you can bet that it will be on slides covered about 2-3 lectures ago. If you use those topics as a guide and prod around, Jan can't lie, so I suggest you straight up ask her if, say the quiz will have 'Assembly' coding on it. If she says 'maybe', or does a slight nod, it's probably a yes. Use your best judgement.

Labs - you can tell that no one put any effort into these as my labs were titled with the previous semester with the wrong directory name. We spend the first third of the class trying to locate the file, the 2nd third trying to figure out what the directions were asking and the rest trying to follow the confusing instructions. Put out your best effort and hopefully your grader isn't a dick and gives you a 2/2. Highly suggest consulting the people around you.

Projects - start early. Try to talk to Jan/TA(/friends). Use Piazza. They are hard and you never know what the Secret Tests are looking for. If you think you're done, you're not done yet.

Exams/Final - You'll be able to pick up clues on what's to be test in lecture and if your TA is nice, in discussion. Give yourself code to write and run them on your computer before you have to spit it out on paper. If you've had to do it on a project, expect to do a simplified and different version on an exam/final.

TA - possibly one of the worst TAs I've ever had. Thought he was too smart for anyone else and just sat in the front of the class not answering any questions. Complained about now being paid enough ... -__-



Overall, if you're not a CS genius, work your ass off if you expect to even pass.",251
plane_jandelyn,4,,CMSC216,"Alright, so this class is gonna suck, regardless of who you chose for 216. 216 is a fast-paced course by nature and on the way you'll likely be learning two new languages - C and assembly. If you barely passed 131/132 or had trouble on some of the assignments I HIGHLY recommend you work on projects early. These are not the kinds of projects you just sit down and burn through in a few hours like in 132, and I took the honors version.

Anyways, Plane is a decent 216 professor, she uses the same slides as all of the other professors use and she remains fairly engaging at 9 in the morning, so that's good. She does a good deal of coding examples in lecture which helps you understand topics. I would recommend you go to lecture and work a bit on your projects while she teaches, and pay attention during the more important bits of the lecture.

There are six projects in this class, each with about two weeks to do. The spec for each one is drawn out and boring to read, but make sure you do, as there are a lot of hidden tricks and requirements hidden in the text. Gone are the days of private tests - 10 percent of your grade is public tests, and 75 is secret tests. You don't get to see what your project grade is when you submit - you wait a week and you get a magic score. Again, start these early. If you finish early, great, you can relax for a week and you are prepared for the quizzes. Again, this is NOT like 132. Secret tests often test a bunch of odd things (malformed input, large sample size, etc) and since you can't see the results until it is graded you can't just spam submits like in 132 until you get that perfect submission.

Quizzes are slightly tough. If you haven't started the project most likely the material on the quiz will be brand new to you, and considering you are given 15 minutes to do a few concept questions and a programming assignment, you need to know the subject matter going into the quiz.

Labs are the same as quizzes - if you have started the project, you should know what you are doing because the labs are a derivative of the project material of stuff that has gone on in lecture.

Tests are fairly hard, alot of programming questions, and the graders seem to love taking points off on things like syntax (I always found that rather stupid - a compiler will catch syntax errors, not logic errors). All you really need to do is look over all of the slides (posted online) before each test and refresh yourself. If you do well on the quizzes, labs, and projects up to the test, you should do fine.

I learned so much from this class - and that's because the class moves insanely fast. You'll be doing C projects while learning assembly, then going back to learning C and doing assembly projects. If you are not up to date with the latest 131 and 132 concepts (recursion, structures, blah blah) you will get your ass handed to you in this class. I aced 132H and this class was much more time-intensive.",251
plane_jandelyn,4,B,CMSC216,"I'm going to start off by saying that this class was hard. Really hard. Probably the hardest class I've ever taken. I breezed though 132 and pulled an A easily, but 216 kept me stressed almost the whole semester and especially during the last two weeks of the course.

This is the review of the course:
-From what I've heard from friends the books are useless, don't buy them. (I didn't)
-The entire course is in a Linux environment, through GRACE. If you're already familiar with Unix commands and such, you're in luck. Unfortunately I wasn't, and this made the first few weeks using it very, very confusing. Even at the end of the course I still felt weak with Unix.
-You use Emacs to code in which is OK. The debugger is complicated and I never bothered leaning how to use it. I just debugged using print statements and other little tricks.
-The major topics for the course were as follows: Learning basic C, Arrays in C, Structures, Pointers and pointer arithmetic, Makefiles, Dynamic Memory, Assembly, Process Control, Function pointers, Threads, and some misc.
-Both Midterms and the Final were good. They were challenging but definitely not unreasonable and tested fair material.
-The quizzes, on the other hand, were plain rude. The difficulty was unreasonable, they tested stupid material, they were graded harshly, and everyone failed the shit out of them. I failed every quiz except for 2.
-Lab exercises were really hard for me, and I felt like everyone knew what they were doing except me. I would recommend trying to study the material that the lab is on beforehand. It's hard to ask questions when you're completely lost.
-There were 6 projects, each of them took around 10-18 hrs to complete. Projects for this class were hard and stressful (a recurring theme). I didn't need office hours at all in 132 but I went for 4/6 projects for 216. The difficulty of the projects went up for each one. Even though the projects were extremely challenging, I thought they were all semi-reasonable as long as you started early. Except for the last one. 
-(Mini rant) The last fucking project. Assigned literally 10 days before the final, it was easily the hardest and longest project of the year. Project 6 stressed me out so much that I felt like I was going to vomit in the coming days before it was due. (Right before the final remember) You have to pass 75% of the public tests for each project to pass the course, and I couldn't pass any of them until the day before the project was due. I tried to go to office hours all 3 days before it was due, and each day office hours had at least a 20 person waiting-list for 1 TA. I have NO IDEA what Jan was thinking. How difficult was the project to complete? Fuck if I know, I didn't even try to implement threading because I needed to study for my two hardest finals that were the first day of finals week. 
-Overall the course was VERY fast paced. Looking back I definitely learned a ton from the course, but I didn't really have time to get a thorough understanding of all the topics.

This is the review of Jan:
-I'm giving Jan 4 stars mainly because I think her current rating of 2 is too low. 
-Jan is a very nice person and a pretty good lecturer. She has a good grasp on all the material and knows what she's talking about. It's not too hard to pay attention in class, there is just so much material that it's easy to instantly forget a lot of it.
-The format of the class is a bit boring. Powerpoint lectures.
-Some of the powerpoints are not well done and confusing. You really need to pay attention in lecture to figure out what's going on. Especially the powerpoint on Assembly, which I thought explained Memory very poorly.

Advice:
-Go to class, study before the Lab Exercises and quizzes.
-Start the projects as early as you can. I wish I hadn't procrastinated some of them.
-Make a couple friends and talk about the projects together. Yeah it's technically against the rules, but it will keep you from going insane when working on the projects.

plane_jandelyn,4,B+,CMSC131,"She is a really nice professor. She cares about her students but does not mind that most of them are not paying attention to her. She gets really annoying with her cat analogies, but she is a good teacher.

She describes concepts well and exams are not that hard. Quizzes are also pretty easy. The bad thing is that the last project she assigned were almost impossible. They were way beyond our level of programming and I just feel she did not prepare us well for CMSC132",251
plane_jandelyn,4,A,CMSC131,"Jan is a decent professor.  She does a good job teaching the material, but if you have any programing knowledge you'll find the class slow and boring.  Since this is an intro to java course and aimed at people who never programmed before.  
Projects and exams are the same with any teacher and aren't very hard.  
Contrary to what others say I found the quizzes to be quite easy, some of the quizzes on inheritance were pretty hard and I failed maybe 2 the entire semester but each quiz counts for very little of your grade.  Just do well on your projects and exams and you'll do fine.

You will breeze though the class if you have prior programming knowledge.  If you don't have prior programming knowledge this class isn't impossible you'll just have to work a little harder and go to office hours or ask a friend to explain it to you.",251

Her lectures were to the point and covered most of the important exceptions that help. Quizzes and tests were a breeze, as was the final. Labs are very simple and take only a few minutes.

Projects sometimes do not overlap with the material being taught, and often take a bit of extra effort, but they are generally not difficult to finish, as long as you start on time. The last project is a bit tricky, though.

Overall, a pretty good teacher. I found her lectures helpful, although she does tend to be rather repetitive since this class is geared more towards people without programming experience. Some of her metaphors are quite helpful, I found quite a few of them enlightening, although I can kind of understand being put off by them.

Don't listen too much to the other reviews; as long as you actually attend classes and vaguely pay attention, it's definitely a softball class.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,A-,CMSC131,"Pros: Jan cares a lot about the progress of her students. I went in to her office hours a few times, and she was a huge help. She's very thorough with her explanations.

Cons: I found it extremely difficult to pay attention in lectures, and I stopped going after a few weeks. Don't be deceived by the lecture slides posted online, because they don't always cover everything that Jan covers in class.

Also, if you're like me and you prefer to learn everything the night before an exam, don't expect to do well. Weekly quizzes are given to ensure you're keeping up with the material.

Bottom line: This class wasn't exactly a nightmare for me, but it wasn't all that fun either.",251
plane_jandelyn,1,,CMSC131,"Jan Plane is a horrible teacher!  She actually does try, but she just makes no sense to me.  About half way through the course I started going to lectures by the other instructor -- Fawzi Emad -- and it is 1000% better.  Mr. Emad explains things in a way that anybody can understand.  If you have a choice, take the class with Emad not Plane.",251
plane_jandelyn,2,A,CMSC131,"I got an A in this class but I cannot imagine how hard it is if you have no programming experience.

My programming experience is very limited but it definitely helped a lot.

She tries to use metaphors but she doesn't understand that metaphors are suppose to be something that students can easily relate to to make things more clear. So when she teaches she just makes things confusing as hell.

She responds to her emails at ridiculous speeds and is very friendly and approachable outside of class.

The quizzes in the class are INSANE. They are so hard and purposely made to hurt your grade. My TA sucked but some of the others were awesome.

Exams are hard to finish on time (except for the final)",251
plane_jandelyn,2,B,CMSC131,"I consider my  self to be a pretty computer savvy guy, but this was my first programming experience... Lectures were boring, didn't really cover everything I felt was needed for the projects.. Jan did offer help on projects and pretty much does them for you if you go to here office hours or email her constantly.. Thus I received high As on every project.. QUIZZES were IMPOSSIBLE.. I have a D average for quizzes. EXAMSSS.. are rediculous like everyone below me said they are beyond impossible to finish on time and extremely hard.. look to make most of ur points in projects. if you do Well on projects you might just get a B

plane_jandelyn,1,C,CMSC131,"This class with this teacher is ridiculous.  Not only is she incredibly boring, but she makes things that could be easily understood incredibly hard to understand.  She also LOVES cats and makes every analogy incredibly confusing.

Projects are extremely unclear and confusing.

Exams are idiotic.  She gives a study guide and study questions, and guess what, very few of them have anything to do what showed up on the exam.  SOME of them are based on what she says during lecture but who can understand her?  To top it off, you get very little time needed to complete the exam.  Even the people who have prior CMSC knowledge are struggle to finish on time.

Do NOT take this professor, you WILL regret it, especially if you have no prior CMSC knowledge.",251
plane_jandelyn,2,A,CMSC131,"I took 2 years of Java during high school, but chose not to do the AP Comp Sci test, so I had to sit through this class, which was essentially my 2 years of high school Java condensed into one semester. Didn't fall asleep in class, but didn't pay close attention, either. I did most of my learning through the projects. Quizzes were similar to others' experiences. I'm still kicking myself that I didn't take Fawzi.",251
plane_jandelyn,1,C,CMSC131,"This class is beyond horrible, but she was the ONLY teacher available for CMSC131 at this time.  Only those who have prior knowledge in programming will do well.

The first week or two were okay as it was relatively simple and therefore easy to understand, but after that, it gets boring, at least, with this professor.

Teacher: She is a really nice lady, she tries to help you as much as she can and is approachable outside of class. However, she cannot teach at all.  She is incredibly confusing, boring, and only she tends to know what she is talking about.  She makes things that could be easily understood even harder to understand.  She makes a lot analogies, which are freaking horrible as they only confuse you further.  (She uses lecture slides and refers to examples she puts up on screen.)

TA: My TA was pretty nice, but she follows the instructions of the professor when it comes to how to grade or what to do, so it doesn't really matter how nice she is.

Projects/Homework: You get a project/homework once every 1-2 weeks, since it takes a while to do.  You get a guideline on what you have to do and you have to use what you have learned from lecture.  This isn't so bad because you have a long time to do it, so you can get help from TAs, the teacher, or friends(sometimes).

Quizzes/Exams: WOW, these things are beyond RIDICULOUS.  For someone who does not have prior programming knowledge, you will NOT finish on time.  In my class, only 1-2 people, who DID have prior programming knowledge, were about to finish in time.  Everyone else did not.  Not only are they badly timed, they are HARD.

Like I said earlier, she was the only teacher available for CMSC131, but if you can avoid her, DO SO WITHOUT HESISTATION.  If you aren't a major in computer science, AVOID.  If you can't avoid, you will need to invest an incredulous amount of time if you want an A.  Make sure you get a lot of rest before you enter her class, because she goes through a lot of stuff and she will bore you to sleep.  Her poor speaking skills and habits do not help her either.  It was hard for me to stay interested and awake.",251
plane_jandelyn,2,C,CMSC131,"Other reviews pretty much hit it on the head, so I'm going to let you know that they were right.  At first, she's alright, tolerable, the material is interesting.  And then, just after 'if then' statements, her lectures are off the mark completely.  She zips right through incredibly valuable material with some occasional examples, but nothing near what your then supposed to be able to...code... in your own project.  I emailed her several times with the most unhelpful condensed reply I've ever seen, as if I was wasting her time.  If you haven't had background experience, she is brutal.  She puts questions on the exams that are a harder evolution of an unexplained example in class.
Oh, and yes, ""Office Hours"" IS a 'barrage of chaos', 50 kids to one TA.  A real shame to have this class the first experience that CS majors get.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,A,CMSC131,"This being my first computer science class, at Maryland or anywhere, I didn't come in with any idea of what a computer science class would be like. I thought overall Jan Plane was a successful professor - I learned a lot, and got a lot of good practice for programming. The lectures started off interesting, but as time passed they became less and less, but make sure you keep paying attention, because otherwise you'll suddenly have a ton of information to catch up on without much to draw from, other than going to the TAs for help. 
She has a lot of metaphors for the programming, and the usefulness of those vs. the amount they might just confuse you is definitely up in the air.
The tests weren't too bad at all, but like I said if there's a topic you don't really feel that comfortable with writing code on, make sure you fix that because chances are there'll be a test problem that has you writing code on that.
For the projects she was very helpful, always willing to look through your code to see what the problem was, which was immensely helpful, but make sure you start the projects early or you'll find yourself having to put hours and hours in the few days before it's due. ",251
plane_jandelyn,2,A,CMSC131,"She is simply not a good teacher. The projects are the majority of the grade, but the examples she provides in class are inadequate. Therefore I've had to rely heavily on my programming experience from high school. The last few projects are a little hard even for me, so imagine how hard it must be for someone with no previous experience. If you have never programmed before, don't expect to pass her class unless you're prepared to invest a truly incredible portion of your time into it.  ",251
plane_jandelyn,2,B,CMSC131,"At the start, this class was quite simple to understand, all the concepts were basic and taught at a steady pace that was optimal for understanding the material.  A few weeks in, however, I, being the very-limited-knowledge-in-computer-science person that I am, was overwhelmed.  Seemingly infinite material is provided in a matter of a few weeks, and if you're not extremely diligent and nearly obsessive about learning the material, you'll most likely have trouble here.  

Lectures rarely helped where they needed to (projects, quizzes, etc.)
Quizzes were harder than you could imagine, rarely would anyone pass them (besides the ones that have been programming for 5+ years...).
Projects were just as frustrating - and when you try to go in for help, you're met with this barrage of chaos, stuck in a void where the TAs only meet with you for less than five minutes.  Really, you could learn more about computer programming from the textbook, or any other equally equipped textbook.  

If you're not a Computer Science major or don't have an extremely high interest in Computer Science, save yourself the trouble, money, and credits and don't take this course.  If you do...you've been forewarned.",251
plane_jandelyn,2,C,,"Did not have a great experience with her.  Lectures were boring, quizzes were ridiculously hard and stressed trivial points, and exams were too long and unfinishable.  Her projects were pretty straightforward though, and I learned a lot from them.  She was also very friendly and approachble outside of class.",251
plane_jandelyn,3,,CMSC131,"not a bad lecturer, but not great either. this was my first programing course ever, so i was in the deep end early. she explains every thing, but if you zone out, even for a minute, you are gonna be lost for the next half hour. if you already know about programing, than you probably dont even need to go, as the slides are online",251

I took both HACS100 and HACS101 with her -- the classes themselves weren't my favorite, but Jan is great.",251
murphy_thomas,5,A+,ENEE205,"Dr. Murphy is the best professor I have had here at UMD. The other reviews have it just right; he is quite literally the ideal professor.

He put in a tremendous amount of effort into the class. He created weekly screencasts of the material in an extremely clear and informative manner. He was exceptional at teaching in class, and in office hours. He is so good at teaching that the averages were quite high (despite medium difficulty tests) simply because people learned very well from him.

He is extremely approachable in office hours, regardless of whether you need help in the class or just advice in general. He *wants* students to go to office hours. He truly cares about his students' success.

I wish I could take another class with Murphy, but it's unlikely given he only teaches ENEEE205 now it seems. If you have the opportunity to take him; TAKE HIM!",252
murphy_thomas,5,,ENEE205,"One of the best professors in the ECE department. Lectures are actually interesting, with a good amount of focus on examples. There are homeworks every week which take a good amount of time, but they help to learn the material. Quizzes about every other week but those are created by the TFs and usually not too hard. Labs, on the other hand, are annoying and vague, and lab reports are due weekly. They aren't worth too much, though. There is absolutely no curve in the class, which sounds terrible, but test averages are usually in the mid 80s because everyone more or less understands the material. Tests are fair and similar to samples he posts online. Take him for 205. ",252
murphy_thomas,5,B,,"Great professor and very approachable during office hours. He will literally go out of his way until you understand the concepts. Very dedicated to teaching students the fundamentals of circuit methods.

Homeworks were worth 16% and were indeed difficult, so go to the TA for help. Quizzes are expected once a week, and there were 11 total (the lowest one dropped) and worth 10% total. The first midterm was pathetically easy and worth 20%, the 2nd midterm was a tad bit more difficult and worth 24%. The final was fair game and was actually cumulative and worth 30%.

Final verdict: attend EVERY single lecture because if you fall behind even one class it will be hard to catch up. Make use of all possible office hours and DO NOT PURCHASE the required textbook written by Lawson because it does not help and Murphy's lectures are more helpful.

Note: No curve. At all. Whatsoever. 
But you probably learn more from him than any other professor who gives out ridiculous 10-15% curves.",252
murphy_thomas,5,B,,"I can't say enough good things about him.  He is very good at responding to emails if you cannot make office hours. The homework is doable if you pay attention in class.  Gives you plenty of practice for the exam, and does everything he can to get you to understand and to do well. He is just a great professor.  I highly recommend him.",252
murphy_thomas,5,A,,"BY FAR the best professor I have ever had throughout my entire college career. Extremely intelligent, but more importantly extremely approachable (for office hours) and an extremely effective communicator. Walks you through how to solve problems step-by-step, then gives similar problems on the exams. Problem sets were very instructive. I would take Murphy for any class he offers.",252
murphy_thomas,5,B,ENEE205,Best professor for 205. Take him above everyone. All the other reviews are excellent. Only reason I'm reviewing is so people know that even in 2018 his teaching ability is still the best lol.,252
murphy_thomas,5,A,ENEE205,"Great guy, when I first learned about circuits in Physics 260, I was worried about my major Electrical Engineering because it's all about circuits, but as soon as I was Prof Murphy's class learning about circuits and how to solve them, everything made sense, I had gained more confidence and was sure this major is right for me. Amazing guy, it's crazy how much of a difference a good professor can make. There's weekly problem sets, which are meant to me hard and great practice of the materials, fair exams - prof provides a lot of practice exams, no curve but you won't need it because you will do well. Just practice and ask him for help if needed. ",252
murphy_thomas,5,B+,ENEE205,"I took Murphy's 205 over a year ago and I can easily say he has been one of the best professors I have ever had. He is an excellent instructor, whose exams, homework's, and overall class difficulty are perfectly refined. He won best teacher for a reason.",252

holmes,4,A+,ENGL101,"Stand up guy. He accommodated students well during the pandemic, was easy to communicate with, fast response time, all that. The course load was sometimes overwhelming and it felt like we barely had any time. But besides that, he was super nice and made it manageable. ",255
mamat,3,C,CMSC330,"I had cmsc330 with Anwar and between him and Hicks/Foster, he's probably the worst professor to take for this class. Anwar is a cool dude, but his lectures were terrible and he moves at a pace that was too fast for most students to catch everything. His explanations are less than clear, and I soon ended up watching Hick's online lectures to try and get the rest of the material.

There were two midterms, fairly tricky but not too bad. Both of them were pretty long, and took the full 75 mins right up to the line - they really pack the exams. Definitely study the exams from previous semesters and drill ocaml/prolog programming if you want to do well on these.

Otherwise, it's actually an awesome class and the material is really interesting despite the workload. I felt pretty solid in my standing as a software eng. after this class, because a lot of concepts across different languages kinda clicked for me. Get Cameron Moy as your TA if you can :) Good luck!",260
mamat,3,B+,CMSC330,"Mamat is a very accommodating professor, but his lectures are completely worthless. On more than one occasion, he would explain the material in the first 45 minutes while barely moving through the slides, and then rapidly go through them, only doing quizzes AND SOMETIMES SKIPPING IMPORTANT THINGS ALTOGETHER! 
Fortunately, if Foster/another professor posts their lectures online, the class will be a breeze. Also, the project descriptions are very easy to understand, and the public tests are usually pretty robust, which is great especially if you're used to Nelson's ""figure it out if you can"" approach.
I like the guy, but I didn't attend lecture after the first month and still got an A on the final just by reading slides and doing projects. That pretty much sums up how important his lectures are right there. ",260
mamat,3,A,CMSC330,"The lectures were way too fast and not engaging. By the end of the semester, I was skipping class and watching Foster’s lectures online. The tests and projects were fair, although we were left to just figure out basic SQL on the last one, which was annoying. The class itself is an interesting one, and old tests are provided for study. It’s certainly not the end of the world or anything if you have Mamat, you’ll still learn things, just probably not as much as if you had Foster.",260
mamat,2,,CMSC330,what the heck is wrong with this dude. He goes over his lectures really fast. Cannot take notes and cannot understand anything. ,260

mamat,4,B,CMSC330,He is extremely engaging and I honestly understood the material so well after. He goes fast but the slides are online so you can just note what he says. I'm a visual learner and he's the best at explaining through code examples that he writes on the spot. I would say he is definitely a better professor to have for 330. ,260
mamat,4,A,CMSC433,I like anwar and he keeps class fun but the material is just kinda boring so it is hard to pay attention sometimes. The class feels like just memorizing a bunch of java libraries used for multi threading. Easy Class though and projects are not too bad.,260
mamat,1,B+,CMSC132,"He is a horrible lecturer. Do not take him unless you are willing to basically learn all the material on your own outside of class. To make matters worse, he has tons of clicker questions to penalize you for not going to his pointless lectures. And he doesn't allow laptops in class for students who actually want to learn while he's ""teaching."" The one good thing about his classes is that the grading structure is fair, and the class is organized, but he just has no idea how to communicate the material. He doesn't seem to understand that coding in front of the class in a ridiculously small font while providing little explanation as to what he's doing is not the best way to teach computer science. Going from him one semester to an actually competent lecturer like Eastman the next was a night and day difference.",260
mamat,4,A+,CMSC132,Anwar is a good choice. You will have to learn some things on your own as he doesn't go through everything fully. The amount of notes he provides for students is AWESOME. His tangents are funny but were less appreciated when we had to speed through topics at the end of the semester.,260
mamat,5,A,CMSC330,"Anwar is a pretty good lecturer and incredibly funny. His exams are fair, the average my semester was an 80% on the nose. The only valid gripe people have with him is the pacing of his lectures. He does tend to fly through some of the material on the slides, but if you try to pay attention, you'll be fine. Even moreso, all of his lectures are online, and his lectures are recorded and put online in case you missed them, so you should be fine. The projects will be more challenging than the ones you have had so far in 132 and 216 because you will be forced to navigate through different languages and different concepts, but for the most part, you will survive. 

People have gripes with him for having clicker questions that force you to come to lecture, but that really isn't criticism, because you should come to lecture anyway and he's giving you easy points that'll bump your grade at the end of the semester. 

All around a nice professor and person, and I definitely recommend you take 330 with Anwar. I've never had Eastman, but I hear he's ok too. ",260
mamat,3,B+,CMSC433,"Funny stories, nice guy.  Class grades are pretty fair.
Projects are kinda butt, and clicker questions suck, lectures are mediocre.  I also hate slide trivia exams (which is what he gives)",260

He tells a lot of stories and goes on a lot of tangents, which would be fine if it didn't mean rushing through challenging topics. I often felt like I didn't learn much by going to lecture and wished I didn't need to go, but there are clicker questions in order to enforce attendance. The material itself is very cool and the TAs for 330 are phenomenal. Also, Hicks is supposedly incredible, so if he's an option, take him. Otherwise, you'll be OK with Anwar, you just might need to put in a little extra time and effort.",260

Exams are also pretty easy. I usually finish with 20 minutes left and use the rest of the time to check my answers. I also dislike the MC section, which make up a fair portion of the exams, because they're just memorization and can be kind of tricky. Projects are hard to implement, but the project tests aren't hard to pass. I think I got a 100 on most of my projects. When I took it, projects were 40% of the grade, which should make the class an easy A. ",260

mamat,5,A+,CMSC330,"Anwar flies through the material very quickly, but that's just because there's a lot of stuff to cover.

Clicker questions are not the worst and his slides are very comprehensive, the projects are fairly reasonable to do (better than 216's for sure) and the exams were fair too.

First Exam- 15%
Second Exam- 15%
Third Exam- 15%
Lab Reports (free points) -10%
Final Exam- 25%

I learned from reading the book doing the homework. The quizzes are straightfoward, and easy if you study. For each exam, you get a notecard, but its pretty much filled with formulas. Exams are variations on homework problems. If you know how to use the formulas, you're set for the most part. ",262
upadhyaya,5,A,PHYS174,She's a really nice lady and will pretty much tell you what to do. Also a pretty easy grader. She'll also hold a review session before the practical where you can pretty much go and write down notes on how to do everything on the practical. ,262

agrawala,1,,CMSC417,"I straight up thought this class was an embarrassment to UMD (a top 10 CS school) and Agrawala and his TA Andrew were 100% to blame for it. I strongly advise to wait a semester or two and take this with a different professor.

I'm not writing this post as sour grapes either I performed pretty well in the class, I just started the semester really excited about learning about networks and in the end it all got sucked out of me.

The worst part of the class, the professor, and the TAs is that they create an environment where it feels like they genuinely want you to fail. If you ask about what content will be on exams (you will have no idea what will be covered) the only answer you will get is ""read the chapter and do the problems."" FYI chapters are 1-200 pages of thick, technical textbook with 40+ questions each and exams cover 2-3 chapters. 

I get that college is a lot about being able to teach yourself material, but you shouldn't have to teach yourself an entire class, especially a class as complex as Networks. 

Projects:
- the first two projects were completely useless busy work that consisted of making simple client-server model. At no point in the class do they help you or show you how you would create such a connection (they just go over it on a high level, much different to actual C function calls), you literally just have to figure it out yourself. Not to mention, you have to use CORE, which is a nightmare within itself that even after the class I still have no idea how to use it. The second project is more about ""can you parse in C"" than it is about networks... Idk about you, but I didn't take 417 so I could waste my time tediously using strtok()
- The final project is actually pretty cool - you implement some real deal stuff and you will learn a lot as a result. I wish they had you do practical things in Ruby all along as opposed to just at the end. Also a bonus that you get to work with a partner

All in all, you WILL learn a lot if you take this class, only because you literally have to memorize a textbook to pass. I did not come to college and pay tuition money to memorize a textbook, however. Professors should make it easier, not harder, to understand material and they should genuinely care about your success - Agrawala is neither.

Again, I did well in this class and I am not writing this because I am sour - i genuinely want you to either not take this class with Agrawala for your own good. If you do, I just hope he has magically improved and changed since.  All things considered, there is no doubt Agrawala is brilliant, he's just not approachable and not a good teacher. Twice I went to office hours with course content questions and for advice and twice I got the answer ""read the textbook""... not very helpful. 

Craziest thing is, if Agrawala changed a few things the course wouldn't be so miserable for everyone.

1. Provide some kind of study guides for the tests so we know of the hundreds of protocols what to focus on
2. Provide suggested book questions for each chapter so we don't waste our time doing 40+ problems. There is no reason why he can't give 10 questions per chapter or something like that. ""if it's not on the slides don't worry about it"" doesn't help at all
3. Hold some kind of seminar at the beginning of the semester outside of class that introduces students to CORE and how to get set up properly
4. Stretch the last project to be semester long and have students complete it in useful increments (maybe even add a bit to it)
5. Act genuinely interested in the success and well being of the students as opposed to creating an environment where we feel like Agrawala wants us to fail",264
agrawala,4,A-,CMSC417,"I think the professor was actually a good teacher. He asked questions to get us to think and to understand why things were the way they are. I will say that the lectures were sort of dry, especially if you read the book. But the point was to get us to learn the basic concepts, and then we would study the details ourselves.

I'll admit that the projects weren't entirely connected with the material in the lecture. But to say they were entirely irrelevant is false. I think the previous poster didn't really understand the point of the projects (considering they stated how it was just locate the standard library function and do it in this way, because that wasn't the point). It was to help us to understand how protocols work, and in that sense, it was connected to the material in lecture. But the final project was the most important. It really showed how hard network programming is, because you have to account for so many things, so it's much harder than say, Operating Systems. The final project was meant to help us understand that every decision in networking has some sort of reason behind it. And it does have real world use. So that gives me the sense of accomplishment. It was meant to simulate a real-life project as well, as it took a lot of coding and testing, and you had to work with your group members. I had a group member who only wrote ~200 lines of code or so, but the reason I didn't say anything was because the fact is that we do have other classes, despite this being like a real-life job.

I will agree that the lack of study material or review for exams was disappointing, but there is a reason for that. It's hard to make questions that students can solve in a reasonable amount of time that adequately test student knowledge, thus questions are reused. I'd just recommend studying the questions at the back of the book. It is a vast amount of information to cover, but that's how a lot of courses are.

One thing I do agree is that it would've been better to add a reading schedule. It would have helped a lot.

Overall, I would say I learned a lot from this course. I learned that understanding networking means understanding communication in general. I learned that there is a reason for every decision in a RFC. The professor also taught us that what we needed to learn is how to learn, because this information will soon be obsolete, and that's something important for CS majors in general.",264
agrawala,1,A,CMSC417,"Agrawala was a horrible professor, and 417 was a horrible class.

This was possibly the worst computer science course I've taken yet at this university.

Unlike most other 400-level CS classes, that teach relevant and useful technology, this course seems to be mostly based on obsolete material. The projects don't convey any meaningful skills, and while in other classes I typically can look back on the projects and feel a sense of accomplishment, in this class, I felt like I jumped through hoops. (I got 100% or 90% on all the projects, so this isn't sour grapes -- the projects were just bad.

Further, the projects and lectures seemed entirely disconnected. I felt as if I was taking two different classes where two entirely different things were being taught. Lectures didn't prepare us for projects in any sense. As such, the projects weren't challenging, because they had to be easy enough for us to teach ourselves how to do. This meant that the projects consisted entirely of ""locate the standard library function to do this thing, and invoke it in the right way.""

The lectures were almost entirely taken from the textbook. If any reading had been assigned, this would mean that people who did the reading would get nothing out of lectures. The lectures were presented in an extremely dry and boring way. The lecturer would occasionally ask either extremely simple factual questions or incredibly complicated questions. Nobody was willing to venture an answer, because there was obviously a right answer (which the students didn't want to get wrong in front of the class), and in the simple case it seemed like the instructor was asking a trick question, while in the complicated case the students weren't sure of themselves. The instructor would, after doing this, chide the class for not participating. Further, the instructor would never revisit old or important material.

The exams were entirely disjoint from the lecture or projects. The two midterms focused almost entirely on concepts that appeared on one or two days of lecture. Further, the instructors refused to give students any information about what would be on the exam. This forced students to study huge amounts of information, including large parts of the textbook (which was tested on the exam, even though no readings had actually been assigned and there was no reading schedule for the course). Most students probably gave up; those that didn't were equally unprepared, because the exams were, rather than general, incredibly specific. The only way to get a good grade on the exam would have been to study in huge detail every aspect of the course. Typically, courses that require this have clear focus and direction, but this course had neither. It was like taking a survey of 1990's networking concepts and technology.

Overall, taking this class was a vastly unpleasant experience. I had hoped that something as basic and vital to a computer scientists skillset as *networking* would be treated better at a major university. ",264
agrawala,3,B,CMSC417,"Good professor. Difficult to understand at times because of the accent. He asks a lot of rhetorical questions and goes on and on during lectures; therefore, they seem boring. Also, he just lectures from the slides and he posts his lecture videos and slides online, discouraging many from attending class. By the third week only a handful of people still went (I definitely did not attend), but this could be partly attributed to the class starting at 8am. His exams are almost entirely based on questions from the end of the chapters, and the remaining few questions are based on general terminology/ definitions of bolded words throughout the chapter. The projects in this class were very fair and interesting in comparison to previous year projects. The class is a lot of work because it feels like a programming class in addition to a theory of networking class (it is known as the 2nd hardest CMSC class). If you can keep yourself motivated and attend most lectures this is a very manageable class. Agrawala is a decent professor, but I feel he could be more interactive and give more examples/ real life problems. I would recommend him as a professor",264
bezejouh,3,B,MATH010,"Hes a decent professor overall, but there are a number of things that are very annoying. For one, his accent is very hard to understand initially, so it might take a while to be able to easily understand him. He sometimes makes mistakes while teaching which the class would correct him on, but hes only human so that can be forgiven. But he also assigns points to problems on his quizzes and tests seemingly arbitrarily. For example, he would make one problem on one test worth 12 points but a very similar one would be worth 6 or 8 points. But this wouldnt be so bad if he was even somewhat forgiving when it came to partial credit, which he shows a poor track record of doing. For example, in a 2-part problem, I got 1/2 off because I rounded to hundredths, not tenths. That was the only thing wrong and I lost 4 points for that. He also emphasizes a lot on word problems, so if you are not good at word problems, you are in big trouble. 
",267
bezejouh,1,D+,MATH120,"He is very poor when it comes to explaining concepts and often times is unwilling to answer questions.  The few times he does answer, the response is brief and doesn't even resolve the problem.  I took math 120 with him and found that it was much more of a review class due to his poor teaching skills and since I had not taken math 120 previously, I found myself struggling to understand the material.  Do not take the class with him there are many other better professors.",267
bezejouh,3,,MATH120,"overall nice professor, but when it comes to giving feedback on quizzes, or tests, or asking to further explain what you got wrong he won't give help. exams throughout the semester are weighted as more to your grade than the final. more preparation before hand in class would be preferred to ace the exams",267
bezejouh,2,A,MATH115,"I do not recommend taking a class with this professor. He is very unresponsive to questions and does not clarify concepts that he is teaching at all. He often blames students for not being able to understand the work when he is at fault for poorly teaching concepts. He is also very passive-aggressive when you speak to him or ask for clarification on questions. The final exam was ridiculously difficult, did not have a curve, and caused many students to fail the class. Most of the time he teaches from the textbook and I sometimes think that he forgets he is teaching to a class. A positive I do have is that if you truly show that you are trying in the class and that you are a good student, he may give you a bump. Although it is possible to get an A, prepare to go through a tough semester to get it.",267

She doesn't curve and she grades you like this: 89.998 is a B. There is no hustling for that 0.002% to get an A. Also, the TA during the summer is a gift from bio lab heaven.

parent,5,,CPSP218L,"I'm in Scholars so I had Dr. Parent for both semesters of freshman Colloquium and for first semester Scholars Colloquium. This will pertain to sophomore colloquium, CPSP218L, taken Fall 2019. 

This was a half semester course, meeting once a week, for seven weeks. Workload was super reasonable - we read a book with 12 chapters, each on a different disease that changed the world, and each group of 2-3 students gave a 30 minute presentation on their chapter/disease. After presentations there were short write-ups on the presentations or discussions. 

Presentation was graded more than reasonably and was not overly difficult. Being one of the earlier groups to present made the workload heavy because we had little time to prepare, but we made that choice ourselves (we chose presenting on an early chapter). My advice would be to do the same - it's a lot of work for a week but then you have no/minimal work for the rest of the semester and the assignment is not hanging over your head. Besides, you don't have a lot of work in the first week of classes anyway. The write-ups were easy points and she asked decently interesting questions. You should get an easy and interesting A out of this class. 

She is strict on phones: asked us to put them away and told us we'd lose a lot of points if she saw them. Was serious about it. She was also serious about being on time, since the class met so few times. She's good about answering emails. 
FYI, read the syllabus, it's worth it. ",269

kent,5,A,BSCI207,"I took Dr. Kent's BSCI207 course with Dr. Haag this Spring 2012. It was an extremely interesting course, with a large focus on macrobiological concepts like physiology and biochemistry. It is a great introduction to upper level biology courses. When I first signed up, I was a little apprehensive because I heard a lot of bad things about BSCI207, about how it was hard and uninteresting. But in actuality, it is very relevant to anyone who wants to pursue a degree in Biology. The main thing is to GO TO LECTURE. You will not do well on the exams if you don't go to lecture!! The slides contain minimal amounts of information. All the tested material were things that Dr. Kent/Dr. Haag explained in lecture. The exams are fair. They're not easy, you actually have to study a lot for them. Dr. Kent is an outstanding lecturer and takes the time to drive home important points of the topic. Tough, but enjoyable class.",272
kent,2,C+,BSCI207,"I really didn't want to take this class but I had to because it is a requirement for my major. Unfortunately, I was stuck with Dr. Kent and Dr. Haag for Spring 2012. By far one of the WORST bio classes I have taken at this university. All the material is random BS which makes you want to pull your hair out. They test you on the most pointless topics (3 exams, lowest dropped, weekly quizzes -10 total). Final exam is cumulative with a strong emphasis on the most recent material. All the exams are about 30 true false, 10 multiple choice and short answer. 

Although Kent is very passionate about the subject material, he is a very difficult person to deal with. He really wants to fail his students (which he has expressed he doesn't mind doing). Just an old and cranky old man who does nothing but sip his coffee while lecturing you.

Overall: boring professor, difficult, passionate about bio.

Bottomline: Avoid this professor if you can. Otherwise, good luck...",272
kent,4,B,BSCI207,"I took him with Higgins last Spring. Kent was pretty good. You can tell he enjoyed the material since he was very enthusiastic during lectures. His enthusiasm made it easier to pay attention. His tests were hard, but that's only because BSCI207 is designed to filter people out. He, like Higgins, pointed out specific concepts that were definitely going to be on exams so the class generally knew what to focus on. Overall, I enjoyed his teaching. If you decide to take him or Higgins, go to lecture! Most of the exam material stemmed from his words and NOT the powerpoint slides.",272

He posts his lectures online and they are helpful outlines to study from, but you MUST go to class.  There is a ton of information that is not in the PowerPoint and sometimes he'll even hint as to what will be on the final exam.  His tests are pretty tough (16 multiple-multiple questions and 2 short answers) but there are two group reconstructions that will boost your grade.  If you truly care about the subject, pay attention and study a moderate amount you should get an A.  If you skip class a lot and don't study much you will be lucky to get a B.

He will tell us not to worry about specifics and not to memorize certain information then test us on exactly that. The exams consist of 10 vague short answer questions in a 50 minute window that forces students to write until their fingers fall off because the questions are so vague they don't actually know what he expects in the answers.

kent,1,A,HLSC207,"*class was fully online due to covid*
He doesn't teach. That's it. I didn't hear his voice after the first day of class. His idea of a lesson is releasing an annotated powerpoint and having his students read through it to basically learn the material themselves. I paid $2000 to download powerpoints off the internet, for an honors class. That's just insulting.
Also, he decided to assign group papers called “explorations”. Group projects are already bad before it's impossible to actually meet with your group in person, and group papers are the worst type of group project. The papers were supposed to make us engage with the new material, but he did that by forcing us to research some obscure topic ourselves, then turning around and teaching it to us the following week. Or rather, releasing his research the following week and making us teach ourselves, because again, he doesn't teach.
The final was optional though, so that's kind of cool.
For anyone reading this who's considering joining ILS- the honors college is great. This professor isn't. It was his first year teaching the class, and I hope it will be his last.

He uses pre-made lecture videos which are very short and cover only a tiny fraction of the material that appears on quizzes and exams. This way he doesn’t have to actually interact with the class in any way or teach anything. Also there are no TAs and no office hours. 

Every week you are assigned roughly 60 or so pages of reading mostly from an extremely dense textbook filled with complicated equations. You are then supposed to retain all this material in order to take a 5 question quiz every week based on this text where you only get 1 minute per question and when you finish 1 problem, you can’t go back later and change an answer. Ridiculous. 

It seems he is immensely lazy and doesn’t want to actually teach the subject, which is incredibly discouraging considering this class is a very interesting subject. I have had straight A’s all the way up into my junior year but I have a strong feeling this class is going to change that.

delwiche,4,A+,BSCI207,"I took this class in fall 2011 with Delwiche AND Schultz, so I am reviewing both of them together (and cross-posting this to Schultz's page).

I have to disagree with most of the other reviews on this page. I think people here are just bitter that the class was difficult and covered a large volume of information. I think it acts as a weed-out course for a lot of prospective bio majors. Grades also tended to be low percentage-wise, which can be discouraging, but letter grades are assigned according to class rank and people in my class only needed about a 76 to get an A. There is also a drop-one policy for midterm exams and quizzes, which can help quite a bit

Delwiche and Schultz are both knowledgeable and enthusiastic professors (Schultz especially is a funny dude). Contrary to what they say, however, you DO need to memorize some specific information and diagrams (evolutionary processes of certain body parts and organisms, phylogenetic tree, etc.) in addition to understanding overarching concepts. I highly recommend reading the textbook chapters before each lecture and attending every class, but that's the exact same advice I give for most courses. Make sure to pay attention and write down any diagrams or explanations that aren't on the slides. Also be sure to review BSCI105 and 106 information on their review guide at the beginning of the semester since there is a full-length preliminary exam very early in the semester. It's scaled to be worth only 10 points, but it helps to start the semester with a good grade and a solid foundation in gen bio.

Bottom line: it is possible to do well in this class if you're willing to put the time and work in.",281
delwiche,2,A,BSCI207,"i don't even know where to begin with this! there were just so many things that bothered me about bsci207 with delwiche and shultz. definitely not the best introduction to college classes, that's for sure. As you will find out, bsci207 is the bane of an intro bio majors existence, especially with delwiche and shultz who teach off of a whim. they essentially tailor their class to whatever they want to teach, so it ends up sbeing a disorganized mess of random, miniscule facts and large concepts. This semester with 207, delwiche and shultz decided to hand out eleven pop quizzes, and while only five points each, proved to be major stressors. Delwiche is big on thinking about a concept and making inferences based on the information given (mixed in with a few completely random facts here and there of course). Shultz is very big on memorize these random details here, some equations there. this made it difficult to figure out what would be on quizzes and exams, which by the way were very stressful. typically i did not work in this class, at all, except for the week before exams. there were only two exams and the final, and thank goodness one midterm is dropped. I would cram a bunch of information in my head the week before a midterm with the full intention of forgetting it right after, because of how useless it was. to do well without cramming would mean paying attention to delwiche and shultz's monotonous voices for an hour and fifteen minutes. i went to lecture for the quizzes but never, ever paid attention, which isn't really their fault as much as my sheer inability to pay attention to people talking about algae and biomechanics for so long. while i'm sure they are cool people to talk to out of class, I just had a bad experience with this class. I think I got an A because of the humongous curve (75 and up was an A). The TA's weren't much help either, although they were very nice. Avoid taking delwiche and shultz if you have trouble paying attention in lecture, or never learned how to think about biology. at least it's a good way to bond with friends, bsci207 has become a running join between my friends and me. ",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,"This was my first bio class coming into college. I initially thought that bio would be my easiest class, since it was purely memorization. I was so wrong though. BSCI207 with Delwiche and Schultz turned out to be my most difficult class. They emphasized so much in the beginning of the semester that ""memorizing everything will not help you"" and that instead you must ""focus on the broad concepts."" I took their words too literally, and didn't review much of the material for the first midterm. After taking that exam, I realized they expect you to memorize EVERYTHING they say in LECTURE. Basically, Delwiche and Schultz orient the class on their own interests, with Delwiche lecturing on plants and botany, while Schultz takes over every few weeks lecturing on a totally unrelated topic of biomechanics. To me, these topics ambiguously fell under the class topic of ""organismal biology"" and it was very frustrating that they did very little to show the relationship of the topics we learned (we started with plants, jumped to viruses, then random bio-astronomy, back to plants, then metazoa [took students forever to realize metazoans are organisms--Shultz should have just straight up told us], to plants againnnn, then the biomechanics of an muscle, finishing with numerous other random topics I cannot remember). 

To do well in this course, pay attention in lecture. If you can't focus for the full hour 15 minutes, record the lecture and review it with the powerpoints they post on BB. If you don't have lecture recordings to go with it, the powerpoints are rather useless. Also, do all the past exams they post. And most importantly, memorize everything. ",281
delwiche,3,,BSCI207,This class sucked. Its a combo of 105 and 106 but more in depth and viewing information a different way and if you're really not interested in evolution and phylogenies then get ready to be pissed after every exam! Delwiche was an okay lecturer but he kinda acts like a jerk.. and Schultz is a worse lecturer but really nice (at times). The exams are ridiculously hard with MC choices like (2 of the above) and (none of the above) so that sucked. And the pop quizzes... what college course has pop quizzes?! Lol anyway avoid these 2 professors if you can...,281
delwiche,3,,BSCI207,"This is more of a review for the entire course of BSCI207 with Delwiche AND Shultz...

So...snidely insulting a student's intelligence after he asked a question during lecture in front of the whole class made me lose a ton of respect for professor Shultz, though he is the more effective lecturer. I admit, it was kinda funny, but totally inappropriate and unprofessional in that setting. It made him seem a lot less approachable, at least to me. Delwiche seems like the more approachable professor for students who have questions or concerns.

Shultz's lecture slides conveyed the course material better than Delwiche's lecture slides. And at times, I did not entirely understand the main points of Delwiche's lectures because it was not that explicit (though the plant unit slides were fine).

The tests were okay, and showed that one must know a lot more than just rote memorization of facts in order to be successful. You must be able to logically synthesize the information presented to you, and this is indeed an important skill that they emphasized during the course. 

I honestly didn't open the print textbook that much for this course, though I used the online textbook, and did the chapter outline quizzes, etc but that's just my style. 

For the ""pop"" quizzes, you must know the little details covered in the recent lecture. Even if you wrote it down, always review your notes after lecture or right before lecture, because you probably forgot what you wrote down! Happened to me a lot, frustrating.

This was my 1st biology course taken at UMD, so I don't know who/what to compare this to in terms of biology professors/lecturers/courses. They seemed just alright, and the tests seemed fairly difficult I guess. I think an average student (who goes to all the lectures and takes some notes) can pass with a mid to low B.",281
delwiche,3,A,BSCI207,"I read most of the reviews on here and I just think most of it is really biased. So I will be as unbiased as possible when I am rating Dr.Delwiche and Dr.Shultz. 

BSCI207 is a really tough class. The entire class is about the evolutionary past, so you can't really apply the knowledge you learned until you get the present organisms (which also explains why it's 3 credits because you can't really have a lab about evolution).

Dr.Delwiche and Dr.Shultz taught this class. Dr.Delwiche taught plants and microorganisms while Dr.Shultz taught metazoans. They are mediocre instructors. They aren't the greatest, but they aren't bad so you can't really complain that they are bad teachers. 

The reason why I think the ratings on this page are biased is because of the difficulty of the class. It doesn't matter what professor you take BSCI207 with because either way it will be very difficult. I don't know how other professors does it but Delwiche and Shultz base your grade on a class ranking system. The top of the class gets A's while the bottom part of the class fails. There are pros and cons behind this. Pros are that students are able to get good grades. The exams are very difficult...so it will almost be impossible to get an A by total percentage wise (assuming 90% is an A). The exams are so difficult that 76%+ = A, 70% - 76% = B, 62-70% = C, etc. The cons are that some students are bound to fail. 

If you are good at biology and have a lot of confidence that you can do well in this course, then Delwiche/Shultz is for you because of the class ranking system. If you are not confident, I would recommend taking with a professor that uses the percent-grading system.

I really believe that the bad ratings on this page are because of the ranking system. I can see why the ranking system can frustrate a lot of people. However, if this class used the percentage system, no one would get A's. 

In conclusion:
-Delwiche and Shultz are decent instructors
-This class is really really hard
-The grade you get is based on your rank # in the class
-The textbook doesn't really help, but you might as well get it because it's $5-$10 online
-DON'T purchase MasteringBiology with the textbook because it's useless (it's a complete waste of money)
-Delwiche and Shultz are good people, personality wise
-Exams are really really difficult, you need to study a lot for it, probably more than any of your other classes
-The exams require you to think and apply everything you learned about biology
-BSCI207 doesn't ask you ""what"" questions, they only ask you ""why"" and ""how"" questions so you REALLY have to know the concepts by heart
-This class is PURE concept, not memorization
-Biology application is this entire course",281
delwiche,4,A,BSCI207,"Took BSCI207 with Dr. Delwiche in Fall 2010 - it was my second time taking it. I'm a senior with a 3.6 GPA so I'm telling you honestly that this is a difficult course.

Don't blame the professors. I took it the first time with Dr. Cooke and Dr. Jensen because I've heard so many good things about Dr. Jensen, but the material was exactly the same and presented in exactly the same way (hell, some of the lecture slides were even identical!). 

Dr. Delwiche is a great guy, always fun to talk to and willing to help you. He's really intelligent, also. One of the more interesting ""plant"" guys that I've met.",281
delwiche,1,B,BSCI207,"Delwiche is the devil. He comes in a pleasant disguise, but don't be fooled by his excitement about algae. He will try to fail you just as well. Delwiche and Schultz co-taught this class and neither one of them knew what they were talking about. Both Delwiche and Schultz are obsessed with their research and they don't know how to explain anything other than that. Schultz introduced himself by talking about spider penises and how they give ""nuptial gifts"" to the females. This was the only lecture that I ever understood from the class. Seriously, if you need to take this class don't EVER try taking it with either Delwiche or Schultz. They ended up using a bell curve, so in order to get a B in the class you needed higher than an 80%. They were not sympathetic at all. They would give no points back on tests, even if you provided a perfect explanation on essay questions. They were the worst!!! ",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,"ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS CLASS! You will learn almost nothing that you will ever use again, while sitting through the most uninteresting lectures of your entire life. Professors are indifferent towards students and are very self absorbed into their research and weird stuff that they are interested in (Shultz was also the teacher for this class). Put random side notes on exams - speaking of their exams they are ridiculous.  You will study for days and still fail.  Don't waste your time, and if this class is required for your major TAKE IT WITH A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR or you will regret it.  ",281
delwiche,5,A,BSCI207,"Dr. Delwiche is honestly one of the most caring and dedicated people (not just professors) that I have ever met.  Take heed, this is not an easy course, but in terms making himself available to students and doing everything he can to help them, he is unmatched.  If you introduce yourself to him, at all, he WILL remember you, not only by face but by name.  If you ever wander up to his office looking for help, as I did on only a few occasions, he'll set aside whatever he is working on and meet with you, and answer any questions you may have.  He is passionate about his research, and his lectures are engaging.  I can't stress enough, if you are having trouble in the class:
-A) download the lecture slides, and read the corresponding sections of the book as you go through them.  They will provide a much more detailed description than one can reasonably fit on a lecture slide.
-B) If you're having problems in the class, talk to Delwiche.  He is more than reasonable and will do everything in his power to help you.

In conclusion: hard class? yes.
Great professor? that too",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,I just took the second exam for this god forsaking class. Have not studied like this for so long only to get an exam with questions that weren't remotely close to the study guide. Please please please do your self a favor and DO NOT take this class with them!,281
delwiche,1,I,BSCI207,"I hate 207. It isn't nothing like my advanced plasemint biology at High School or at the community colleges I been too. It seem like you have to take notes and read the book and even that won't mean you will do good on the exam. The lectures are so boring I would fall asleep, but I like talking to the guy next to me who feels the same way and we get through it somehow. The lectures don't entertain me enough; I need lots of sounds, colors, motion and stuff to keep my interest. All these guys do is like stand and talk and talk and show slides of stuff that nobody care about. What's so great about plants and bugs and stuff anyway? What a waste of my time. If you like me, don't take this course!",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,"One of the most ridiculous classes I’ve ever taken. Be prepared to take extremely detailed notes (and that’s not going to be enough- put in A LOT of extra study time). I would suggest probably recording the lectures (I didn’t do this but thinking back, it may have helped). This class was co-taught (partly by Prof. Delwiche and Prof. Jeffrey Shultz). Their teaching styles are different- Prof. Shultz’s lectures come straight out of the book, are monotonous, and boring. You will be tempted to fall asleep (during either one’s lectures). At times, the material we learned didn’t seem to connect (it seemed like we were jumping around). Exams are random, ridiculous, and (most often) unfair. There are 4 undergrad TAs and 1 grad school TA. This time around, they were absolutely no help and tended to contradict each other. They’ve either forgotten the material or just don’t know it. There is no discussion section for this class; the TAs hold review sessions throughout the week. Random topics that were never fully discussed in class ALWAYS come up on the exams and are worth a lot of points. Reading the textbook thoroughly will help but does not guarantee in any way that you will do well on the exams. 

This class will be horrible no matter who you take it with, but please, take another professor. Occasionally these two have condescending attitudes when you ask them questions. At times, you wonder whether they really want their students to do well.
",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,"Well. You won't expect a good review from me. Dr. Delwiche starts off in the beginning of the semester taking pictures of his class. He is more of a photographer than a professor. His powerpoints are absolutely trash. They are just pictures with little or no text. You literally have to record his lectures because there is no way in hell that you write that fast. His exams are irrelevant. It is like a giant tank water with thousand of balls with words on it, and he has manatees swimming around in it and push the balls into an opening. In that opening, the balls falls in a lottery type machine and the words form a sentence. That's what a typical Delwiche exam question looks like. ",281
delwiche,2,B+,BSCI207,"This class was just crazy. Everything that one would expect to be on the exam, the kind of stuff that you should come away with from a class like this was not there. Instead, look forward to memorizing every random fact that comes up in lecture. As tempted as you may be DO NOT FALL ASLEEP! Whatever little fact you may miss in that 5 minute nap may  very well make a free response worth hefty points on the exam. Also, work on writing a lot in only a few minutes. Most of the exam is free response, and sometimes even what seems like the most comprehensive explanation to you may not get you full points on the question. The only other  graded work beyond the exam was a museum assignment, which was actually graded pretty harshly, so do it well. Take very copious notes during class, or record lectures, since the PowerPoints, tho available, are not ever good enough to study from as they are simply pictures. Wikipedia becomes a good friend to look up stuff like formulas that are not fully explained in class, but that WILL COME UP IN THE EXAM, you can count on it. Nothing against the professors personally, since they both seemed very knowledgeable, but class was pretty boring, and the exam was ridiculous. ",281
delwiche,3,B+,BSCI207,"First off let me say TAKE ANOTHER PROFESSOR!!! Delwiche is very very interesting and he clearly knows his stuff. He is excited about plant biology and he makes it interesting to learn about. However, the tests are impossible, and he picks random nonsense that he's interested in for the essay questions and the fill in the blank (no word bank). You better be prepared to read the book if you really want to fully understand whats going on. As for Schultz (the guy that he tag teams with) he is TERRIBLE. His lectures are the most boring ever and i definitely fell asleep multiple times. His lectures jump around and are NOT sequential at all. You learn random crap about muscles and then half way through the lecture we're learning about water and electrolyte balance. 
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE ANOTHER PROFESSOR UNLESS YOU WANT A TON OF READING TO DO IN ORDER TO SCRAPE BY WITH A ""B"". ",281
delwiche,1,D,BSCI207,"PROF IS THE WORST PROFESSOR AT UMD. avoid him at all costs. honestly, i have never done so badly in a class that i study so much for. his exams are a joke, pulling questions out of the blue, testing you on a senseless amount of material. he is obnoxious and arrogant, and his lectures are pointless. 
this class ruined my GPA.",281
delwiche,5,A,BSCI207,"Dr. Delwiche is an amazing professor. His class is hard, but as long as you pay attention in class and take good notes you should be fine. It also helps to have a vast knowledge of introductory biology. Dr. Delwiche is really friendly and willing to help his students. His expertise of microogranisms is evident during he lectures. I would highly recommend him to anyone. ",281
delwiche,1,,BSCI207,"He is an awful awful professor.  I regret taking his class more than anything I've done all of college.  He is arrogant, his exams are ridiculous and have no focus and it is impossible to study for them.  He doesn't teach, and his slides are just dozens of pictures that have no relevance to the subject matter.  If you have to take him, the only thing I can recommend is to make sure you read the book.  It's not a guarantee for a good grade, mainly because his exams are ridiculous and don't make sense.  But it is the only concrete way to study.  Since the lecture slides have virtually no information on them, taking notes while he speaks is very important, something I didn't realize until it was too late.  However, regardless, it is impossible to write down everything he says because he speaks faster than you can write, and the topics he goes over are so random that it's hard to know what's important and what's not.  
As an example of how ridiculous the exams are, we had an essay question asking us to describe how a bird's digestive system works in detail, when nothing like that was ever mentioned in the book or in lecture.  We learned about bird RESPIRATORY systems, but not digestive systems.  The first thing that occurred to me when I read that question was that he got mixed up and in his infinite wisdom mixed up digestive and respiratory systems.  I still don't know what the answer to that question was...",281
delwiche,3,B+,BSCI207,"This is a review from someone who had this professor this past semester. I must say, he is a smart, approachable, and kwirky person, but, he is very intense at the same time. What do I mean by that? His lectures are very intense, his tests are even more intense and his powers of observation even more so. Let me tell you something: Be prepared to work hard. There are no freebies in this class; even a museum assignment that would seem simple required a lot of work to be done. He keeps track of who actually comes to lecture and whatnot, so keep that in mind if you want a good grade in this class. Although our test averages were horrifying at times, there was a curve in this class, and he drops one test- take note however, this doesnt mean that you should flunk any one test. Somehow even after dropping a test and curving, MANY people got Cs and even Ds. That might have somethign to do with one of the final questions, which was worth close to 15% of the entire exam: Describe the origin of life, draw the phylogenetic tree and explain how life evolved. Basically, it asked you to summarize the whole course in one question-in 8 minutes. I was happy to get the grade I got. One more thing: Avoid this class if you can, especially if you arent too fond of plants and/or fossils.
And, please show up to class.",281

If you have to take it with him, attend all lectures (although you learn nothing from them). MEMORIZE EVERYTHING. including chapter and lecture notes.  Not only do the exams have extremely unclear and confusing questions and you have to write paragraphs for each question, the TAs are also strange graders.

levermore,3,,MATH246,"Pros: Very intelligent, clearly knows what he is talking about, seems really nice and friendly, and doesn't give you busywork (except for Matlab, which sucks, but that isn't on him. His grading policy is also specifically designed to give you as fair a grade as possible, and to not screw you if you mess up occasionally. His website is also a tremendous resource. I personally didn't find his notes too helpful, but many did, and his online exams and quizzes are incredibly valuable.

Cons: His intelligence gets in the way of his teaching, and he makes things that should be easy in application seem very complicated. I would often read through his notes trying to understand what the heck was going on, then watch a youtube video on it and understand it very clearly, and think ""why didn't he just say that?"". He understands things on a different level than most students, and that is the level he teaches on, because that is how his mind works. Pure mathematics is not a strength of mine, so this caused me difficulties. He also does cover a lot more material than other people do in general for diff eq, so this makes it harder to find supplementary resources on it. This inability to lecture or explain things clearly has caused big problems for me and many people I know.

Synopsis: if you have an easy schedule or were really good at calc2 and calc3, then take him, because you'll get the highest grade from him. Just be prepared to teach yourself, because odds are you'll have a hard time learning from him. If you thought those classes were hard, or you are taking a heavy class load (i'm taking 19 right now and i'm slowly but surely drowning), take someone else who's a better lecturer, or put diff eq off until you have the time to dedicate to it, because, especially with him, it's a ton to digest and master.",283

His website is AMAZING and you can find old exams as well as class notes on his webpage as well, which is extremely helpful.

As people have mentioned his website is a great resource. There are old quizzes and exams to study from which are extremely helpful. His notes are also quite helpful. A lot of the time though I usually did not understand the theory that he explained before he went into examples which there are plenty of. I usually went to his notes rather than the textbook which is an okay secondary resource.

His lectures were okay. I usually felt pretty confused. He is obviously a really smart guy but sometimes his explanations were not the greatest. I also felt like I memorized a lot methods rather than understanding differential equations but who cares.

levermore,4,,MATH246,"Levermore

THE GOOD: Levermore is a good professor. He really limits the proofs he does on the class, which is good for engineering students. He is also very dedicated to teaching diffeq. His website is really well designed. It’s obvious he spent a lot of time on his class notes and sample problems for exams (he uses the same ones every year).  Exams questions were predictable since he uses a similar format every year.

THE BAD: Personally, I found differential equations difficult. This is a class where the curve can work against you if you make lots of careless mistakes. Some of his “shortcut” methods (especially partial fractions and linear algebra stuff) are somewhat cryptic and hard to understand. 

OVERALL: Good professor, hard exams. If you are looking for an easier A, then take someone else.

And, as a bonus, it was really easy for me to picture him as a super villain who spends his nights punishing students who don't know math. This served as a great incentive to learn diff eq.",283
levermore,3,A,MATH246,"Levermore taught us fairly well, but it seems like he taught us more how to do the problems in the class and less how to do differential equations in general. It doesn't seem like there are a whole lot of good diff eq professors in general, but I would recommend Levermore over others.",283
levermore,5,A,MATH220,"Levermore is a good guy. His lectures are not great, in fact they're quite boring. However, at times he will clarify questions if asked and he seems like he genuinely cares. Go to his office hours and he is more than happy to help. He also has a very generous grading policy. I stopped going to lecture and taught myself out of the book. Easy A.",283
levermore,5,A,MATH246,"Levermore is a pro at teaching differential equations. He really knows who the class is made of - primarily scientists and engineers, not mathematicians. His online notes are then particularly useful because he takes the time to write out general formulas that can actually be applied to real-world problems. I am saving his notes for life.",283
levermore,5,A,MATH246,"Great professor and nice guy. He is very reasonable with grades as his policies suggest. Drops a quiz and matlab, replaces quiz grades if you do well on the test and curves generously if you perform well on the final. I probably had around an 85 going into the final but he curved me up to an A since I did well on the final. Most importantly, his website is amazing. I literally went to class for 10 minutes a week just so I could take my quiz and learned everything off class notes and previous quizzes/tests. If you read his online notes intently, you will get an A in the class. He is better than the other teachers from what I have heard and a great choice for differential equations.",283
levermore,4,A,MATH246,"Lecture:
Levermore was not the greatest lecturer, but from what my friends experienced in other 246 classes he is probably your best bet.  Definitely helps to be a math major and know many different math terms and symbols.  Handwriting was subpar.  You really only need to go to lecture for the last three weeks or so because that is when he goes over phase portraits and right before the second exam when he goes over spring forces because theses are not on his online notes. (He has great online notes that he posts)

Website:
Seriously best website ever, take him because of his website.

MATLAB: 
Is difficult I can't really grade him for it though, he just assigns it and we have to figure it out (buy the MATLAB book, it does a pretty good job)

Grading:
3 Midterms (100points each)
6 MATLAB's one dropped (20 points each)
11 Quizzes (almost every Tuesday during lecture 10 points each)
Final (200 points)

He also has some crazy grading systems which you can look up here:
http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~lvrmr/2010-2011-S/Classes/MATH246/Quizzes.html

Hint: look over the past couple years quizzes to study for each quiz (he keeps the answers posted too). And do the practice tests.",283
levermore,5,A,MATH246,"Just finished taking him. Probably the best teacher you could ask for for a class like 246. Very engaging, handwriting sometimes hard to read but bearable.

Best part: His amazing website. All pertinent announcements go on there, grades averages and distributions, awesome sample problems, and best of all: Online notes! His online notes are great; they could easily be a substitute for going to class, but keep in mind there is a weekly quiz.

Exams aren't difficult at all, just look at old exams and the samples problems and you can easily ace the class.",283
levermore,4,A,MATH220,"It's true that Levermore's lectures are difficult to follow and often he will go on tangents in which little will be added to our knowledge of calculus. That having been said, Levermore has a great grading policy, one that is more than fair. I get the impression that he really is not trying to make the students' lives difficult. He seems like a good guy and although he threw out one very difficult test this past semester, that was largely to weed out those who were performing poorly. You will have to teach yourself a considerable amount out of the book if you do not have a calculus background. However, if you have taken calc, this is your guy: no homework and he drops 5 quizzes. ",283
levermore,2,B,MATH220,"First of all most of his lectures are introducing formulas...so pointless to go to them. He gives examples with variables(he is very hard to follow). A couple of his exams had  ridiculous problems that were much harder than the quizzes (he did have an 8 point curve on one unfair problem).

 Although I loved the no homework(webassign) it was hard to discipline myself to actually teach myself from the textbook. I managed and ended up with a B. 

If you have taken calculus before and dont mind teaching yourself from a book this is the class because he has an awesome grading policy. He drops lowest 5 quizes out of 15 and he drops lowest exam if and only if it is 2 letter grades below all the other exams including the final (aka if you get a D on one exam and As and Bs on the rest..he drops the D b/c it is 2 letter grades below the As and Bs). If you dont remember shit or have never taking it then get another teacher and one that can actually teach you!",283
levermore,2,,MATH220,"Levermore is a bad teacher. His tests are confusing, and he likes to trick his students. He does not teach the material well, and his tests are much harder than the other 220 sections. I took calculus before, and still cant manage to figure out this course. Take math220 with a different teacher!
he even laughed in my friends face and told her to do better next time when she expressed that she was nervous about her test grade.",283
levermore,2,A,MATH401,"The class is supposed to be Applications of Linear Algebra, but we haven't learned a single one other than polynomial interpolation for what that is worth. The lectures are useless, the books sucks, and there isn't even a syllabus for the class. It took ten weeks to get the first exam back. The second exam wasn't too difficult but most of the class managed to do poorly since everyone has to learn from the book. The final was pretty easy. Most of the problems came from old tests.

The homework for this class is beyond annoying. Although he assigns only 15-16 problems per week, some of these have up to ""s"" parts, meaning one problem is actually 19 problems. To make matters worse, the matrices increase from size as you go from a to s. Even with a calculator, the homework takes forever. I didn't even bother to do the last problem set since it effectively amounted to 85 problems. 

I wouldn't advise taking Levermore for this class. He can teach differential equations, but he fails when it comes to teaching Linear Algebra.",283
levermore,5,A+,MATH246,"Levermore has no accent and very effectively presents what you need to know - you can't ask for more than that. But, he also has a website with all his old exams and quizzes. He does reviews for exams and the actual exams are nearly identical in format to his practice ones, you can't go wrong if you study. Matlab will take up time but that is just the course not him. Between Levermore and my TA, I managed an A+ which is a pretty big turn around from a D I got when I first took Math246. ",283
levermore,2,B,MATH246,"Ok professor, however just like every other math course at UMD, the structure is terrible. His lectures would leave you left in the dust, got most of my help from the TA during office hours. 

Not impressed with the way this class is set up. Your grade in this class solely depends on what TA you get. They grade all of the quizes and exams. For the last exam, my TA was not given a solution manual and had to make up her own solutions to the exam and then graded my exam. Don't expect to get any partial credit, it's either right or wrong with this class.  I'm so glad that I pay so much in tuition to have my TA teach and grade me. 

",283
levermore,5,A,MATH246,"At first, I hated this guy.
However, once you get used to his teaching method and the extensive information he throws at you at once, he is a really good professor. He has his own methods of teaching things (KEY IDENTITY is his method) and it is by far easier than the other methods. He is the best Differential Equations professor UMD has to offer.
His exams are EXACTLY like his sample tests he posts on his website with only slight variations. Do those and you'll be fine.
Quizes every tuesday sucks, but if you get a higher grade in an exam, he replaces all the quizes leading up to that exam with your exam grade. This is the reason why I got an A in the class.",283
levermore,1,,MATH246,"Not a great professor. He tries to make class entertaining with his jokes and such, but it doesn't compensate for his lack of teaching ability. Don't even bother going to class unless there is a quiz or an exam, you won't learn anything at all. He just writes a bunch of greek symbols and nasty algorithms. Get past exams and quizzes and study those. Also read the book. ",283
levermore,4,,MATH246,"I think he was a good professor. Slightly humorous. His class webpage is possibly the best in terms of utility I have seen from a professor. The exam dates, notes, homeworks, and solutions to quizzes, etc are posted in a very organized, clear fashion.",283
levermore,4,,MATH246,"So-So.

His lectures often left you saying ""WTF?"" He will force you into learning the greek alphabet if you do not know it yet along with drawing some other random symbols. Not too many examples in the lecture however.

The homeworks, old quizzes, and practice test will make sure you are ready to get an A or B in the class as the material really isn't hard for the most part. Easier than Calc 2 for sure. 

Go to his office hours and he does a slightly better job of explaining things to you that he went over in lecture. He is also very approachable and does not have a accent you can't understand",283
levermore,2,C,MATH246,"He can't teach. He spends 75 minutes writing gibberish on the board that no one can understand.  Even the book does a better job of explaining the material than he does. At some point during the semester you realize that you can't learn from him and you might as well skip his class and go to lunch instead.

",283
levermore,4,B,MATH246,"I was expecting to get a B in the class but was pleased to find out that I got an A-.  Although he isn't the greatest teacher in the world, the only advice i can give is to do his sample questions for his exams and the final.  They are EXACTLY like his exams just with different numbers.  Also, for any math class, when preparing for a final exam, go to UMD's testbank and do past exams.  There was a question that was taken verbatim off last years test.  Do his sample questions and past exams and you will have no problem getting at least a B",283
levermore,3,,MATH246,"he was so-so as a professor. I personally found him to be very confusing at times and not very clear. however, the book for the class was awful, and for someone like me who uses textbooks as references, this made the class even harder for me.",283
levermore,1,B,MATH246,One of the worst professors I have ever had.  Rarely uses examples to explain and lectures get confusing with the vast number of symbols and variables he uses.  My TA's were excellent and more effectively explained 2 lectures worth of material in 50 minutes that he was able to do.  Avoid taking his Math246 class.,283
levermore,3,B,MATH246,"He is difficult to understand and tends to strictly teach theory rather than doing examples. Also, his lectures get rather confusing due to the abstract variables, bold letters etc. His tests can be too long vs the time that is given to take them.",283
levermore,5,,MATH246,His lecture is clear and great! You have to par attention though because sometimes he teaches his own methods which are easier than the stuff in the textbook.,283
levermore,1,C,MATH246,"worst professor ever. he is a genius, thats for sure, but he can not teach at all. i have not taken calc 3 yet which is supposed to make it easier but either way... he teaches class like he is reading from a book, which book, i havent a clue, because it sure isnt the one that is assigned to us. he has his own methods for solving things which are not in the book (or any others for that matter) which are not at all intuitive and effectively take up class time, as they are all useless. (to me at the very least). he rarely does examples to illustrate the concepts that he presents to us, and the examples he does use are not very good and are only of the simplest cases. his hand writing is very difficult to read, and his board is very rarely cleaned making it even harder to read the notes. finally, he refuses to accept any excuse for missing an exam. even if your mom dies, he does not care. ",283
levermore,5,A-,MATH410,"He knows the topic really well. Lectures follow the class notes very closely, and homeworks are helpful for learning the material. One piece of advice for taking this class: the tests are similar from year to year. He has old tests posted on his website, so you should definitely use those to study.",283
levermore,4,A+,MATH410,"LECTURES: Very organized, engaging, and useful lectures. He often goes into the history of math during the class, but does so in a beneficial way such that it completely integrated with the course content. He often expects class participation from people (not explicitly graded, but ""factored into the final grade""), but is really good about getting students to ""think like a mathematician."" The class often proved many of the largest theorems in calculus together, which helped with learning the material.

I'd give a subscore of 5/5. Truly the best lecturer I had the semester I took the course.

ASSIGNMENTS: Levermore makes his assignments incredibly difficult in general. I normally spent ~8-12 hours each week on homework for this class (partially since I didn't know how to prove non-trivial problems before this course), but in general, they were very useful at building confidence before an exam. Levermore is very much a ""give hard homeworks, make the test easier"" kind of professor, but at the same time, some assignments were just so much harder than any of the tests we took that it was demoralizing at times. Thankfully, the assignments are not worth a large part of the grade overall, so it's alway spossible to half-ass an assignment and have it not do massive damage to your grade. (The 4 lowest homeworks get dropped at the end of the semester)

I give a subscore of 4/5 -- Assignments were sometimes just too hard to be useful, and often took too long.

EXAMS: Levermore gives 3 exams for his 410 class--two midterms and a final. The exams are largely easy since he recycles most of the questions on the exams from previous homework problems and previous exams in different years. This means that just with proper studying/memorizing, it's possible to get ~80% without understanding the material just by copying answers from previous exams. However, the logistics of exams is frustrating. Our first exam was returned in 3 weeks, which was a bit slow, but our second exam was a different story. We took that exam halfway through the semester, and got the grades back the night before the final, nearly 1.5 months after the test. While the logistics of regular homework assignments was well done (usually given back within a week), the exams were graded directly by Prof. Levermore, which caused significant problems.

Subsection score: 3/5 -- For really bad logistical errors made with grading

OVERALL THOUGHTS: Definitely one of the hardest, yet most rewarding math classes I've taken here. I'd recommend taking MATH410 with him if you're interested in a challenge, and willing to put large amounts of time understanding the material.",283
levermore,3,,MATH246,"Honestly horrible lecturer. Seriously, don't even bother going to class. His online notes are almost in a different language, they extremely complicate fairly trivial topics... but eventually you will get the hang of them and how to decipher them. Still though, horrible class to take, only plus side is that his tests are all fairly similar to past years exams. Literally the only plus to taking diffeq with him",283
levermore,2,B-,MATH246,"Literally horrible lecturer, like horrendous. His online notes are extremely difficult to decipher, and you dont learn anything in discussion because he has you doing graded groupwork. Eventually, you'll learn how to decipher his notes, but in all honesty, what a horrible class. The only perk to his class is that he has past exams and quizzes online so you have a pretty good idea of whats going to be thrown your way. Still though, its a shame that the university lets such horrible teachers teach diffeq, a fairly useful class",283
levermore,3,,MATH246,"What a strange, strange man he is...

He presents the content of this course in a very theoretical manner, so if you do not work through practice problems or if you do not generally understand a string of just theory, you may encounter problems. The practice problems on his website are sometimes unclear as to how he reaches his final answer and you'll have to kinda go through it several times to notice which steps he has omitted. 

Regarding my first comment, he ""speaks in fonts."" If you don't know what that means then oh boy you're in for an experience. He also frequently used the phrase ""licking your chops"" when referring to types of ODEs, then proceeded to make some ungodly schlurpschlupschschlurp sounds. He will ask for volunteers that serve literally no purpose. Just an all around odd experience, but certainly something you should endure if nothing else then as a rite of passage into your big boy classes",283
levermore,3,A,MATH416,"Levermore is cool - as long as you can endure his snarky attitude. His lecture is fine, but I find the pace a bit slow. That said, this man should be banned from teaching new courses. He couldn't finish writing the homework on time for most of the time of the semester, so we had 5 psets for spring break and 4 psets for final's week. That was just not very reasonable. The exams were take-homes because of the pandemic. While the first exam was long and easy (the format was similar to the hw with the workload doubled), the second one was really tedious (he picked the hardest + longest problem from each hw and compiled them together). That was one of the instances when I look at my solution and wonder how on earth would the instructor have the mental power to read through my solution. He graded things very leniently at the end, I'm not sure if it was because he felt sorry for the way he bombarded us with giant hw packages or he's just lenient. Anyway.. the material is very interesting, I recommend learning some harmonic analysis on your own if you get a chance. The text used was Wickerhauser - alright but not the best for self-study (<- so you can't learn everything by reading the book and not attending lectures).",283
levermore,2,A-,MATH246,"Yeah, reading the other reviews, and given my previous success in math courses, I thought 246 with Levermore would be tricky, but doable. My god was I wrong. I do not know how his grade data is as good as it is, I worked so damn hard on this class to get the grades I did but I can not imagine so many people going as insane as I did. I probably sound a bit pretentious by now but anyway if you can take this course over the summer with Justin- DO IT.

Here's what made this course so frustrating:
He teaches more content and some of it he ~customizes~ so if you can't comprehend his lectures or notes, you're basically fucked. I remember googling a term from class and the top results were all his notes. You can learn the basics from Justin's awesome notes, but you will need to learn Levermore's custom/proprietary stuff. The grading policy is pretty good though. I don't think my grievances with this class are due to it being online though. All of the other reviews mention his shitty teaching method of reading through slides/notes. It's terrible.

I can't imagine how bad the other prof's are if he's the least of the evils, but if you can take this during the summer or at a different college, do it. 

I really though I would be fine in this class in spite of the other reviews below, but I was so wrong. ",283
levermore,4,A+,MATH410,"Very knowledgeable in the field. He breaks up his very math heavy lecture with interesting historical anecdote that puts into perspective the depth of the work well. His homeworks are quite difficult and tedious, but he lectures well and is very available for help.",283
levermore,5,,MATH410,"Great professor. I’d definitely recommend taking 410 with him, it really improved my ability to do proofs. Levermore knows a lot about math and its history which makes lectures interesting. He also provides super detailed notes. He is very helpful in office hours.",283

(the online book is basically a compilation of PDFs and practice problems) Make sure to do the best you can on quizzes and other graded assignments throughout the course because the Midterms are killer.

Lectures are interesting, well-paced, and very thorough. Dr. Jarzynski chooses to go through derivations students can already understand (only calc 2 + partial derivatives required) and continually asks questions to make sure anyone who is paying attention can keep up. He takes even the dumbest questions seriously and is always friendly and respectful.

Dr. Jarzynski will make the class seem very easy, but do not be misled. This is thermodynamics after all. For me, homework and weekly studying was very time consuming (minimum 10 hours/week). Tests are difficult to do well on, potentially soul-crushing if you're not fully prepared. Despite this, pchem with Dr. Jarzynski is one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken. ",288

lobb,5,A,PHYS273H,"Dr. Lobb is the best Professor I've had so far and I wouldn't be surprised if it stayed that way.

in terms of teaching, he did a very good job, spending more time on the difficult concepts so students could catch on. Also, in class he would emphasize the important things to learn and used the important equations or techniques over and over again so that he would be sure we understood.
His class was always interesting because he's got a great sense of humor and if per chance the class starts to lull he gives everyone a 10 min break.

His exams are hard--basically applications of the things you've learned--but he is very reasonable and if you make the effort outside of class to get help he is happy to account for that. 

Like another reviewer wrote--he goes out of his way to make sure his students understand and succeed. I would highly recommend him.",289
lobb,5,A,PHYS273H,"Where to begin? Previous reviewer mentions the poor choice of textbook, which was unfortunate. That said, Lobb is one of my favorite professors and one of my favorite people as a whole. His toughness was surprising, given the feeling of trustworthiness he gave off, and as a result he felt like a real mentor, as well as a teacher. I highly recommend him for any course.",289
lobb,5,B,PHYS273H,"Excellent. Very humble, has a great sense of humor, has a great respect for his students, and a brilliant and accomplished scientist. On top of that, even with a poor choice of the textbook (Waves and Vibrations, by H.J. Pain, should have picked book by French), he was an extremely effective teacher. His ability to convey material more htna made up for the textbook. Despite not covering all the material we had hoped to cover (maybe the snowstorm in Feb. had something to do with that), he drilled the material into us well, and I learned so much in this class. Yes, the book sucked, but the notes I took in class from Lobb were very clear and conveyed the information crystal clear. Strived to help students in any way he could, gave extensions of homework assignments, extended office hours, and he is a really understanding professor. Knows that students lead busy lives as well. He really went out of his way to see his students succeed. As he said in the beginning, he does not believe in 'casualties.'

Tests (2 of them) were difficult, but if you knew the material and actually made a strong effort on the homework assignments (9 of them), then they were not bad at all. The homeworks were long and tough, but intellectually challenging, and I enjoyed them very much. If anyone did poorly in this class, it was certainly not Lobb's fault. Likewise the most effective and best professor I have seen in the physics department. If Lobb is teaching PHYS273, TAKE IT. I am not even a physics major, but I learned so much from him. Enough said.

lobb,5,B,PHYS273,"Great guy. Nothing can go wrong taking him, so maybe I should say something about this class.

First I am a math student. This was the first physics class I've taken since high school (did physics c in hs, didn't learn anything), so I was clueless from the beginning. It turned out that I could manage derivations pretty well, and the concepts were very sensible. But whenever there were formula based and plug in chug type of questions I would get totally lost because of my lack of familiarity with those stuffs (and apparently reluctance to memorize them). Not all homework problems were graded, so it was sometimes a pain depending on whether if I correctly solved the graded ones. Also never did too well on the quizzes (bunch of zeros, ouch), but the tests were fine since there were a lot of guided derivations, which I liked. My raw grade on elms was appalling (less than 65%) but I ended up with a B (my tests were all a bit above average). Lobb is strict about material-wise grading (quizzes, tests) but is very lenient when it comes to the final grade. I would say don't worry about grades too much, but focus on the understanding of the material and that feel of doing physics. Last remark, I much prefer French's book to Pain's, especially French's treatment of Fourier series (honestly I didn't read either of them).",289

jacobson_theodore,2,B,,This was a miserable course.  The material is hard and Jacobson is terrible at teaching the material.  He often writes equations or notes on the board without explaining anything.  He did curve a lot on the first exam but the average was still a B after the curve (because everybody did so poorly).  The TA who grades the homework grades very hard so it is hard to do well on the homework as a grade boost.  Do not take this class if you want an A,292
jacobson_theodore,4,B,PHYS411,"This was a really hard class. The material was very difficult. I'd like to say that this class was like a vector calculus boot camp. Problems commonly included partial differential equations, integrations in spherical/cylindrical coordinates, Legendre polynomials, Fourier analysis, and alot of other fancy stuff. The homework problems (from Griffiths) were long and tough, and Jacobson also created his own supplementary problems to add to the fun. They were actually sometimes easier than Griffiths'. 

Overall, Jacobson is a good lecturer. He presents the material quite well, and is very sharp when answering student qustions. If he can't properly address a student's question in class, he'll email the class later on explaining a concept. He is very nice and respectful of student concerns. Instead of just re-writing notes on the board, he actually interacts with student questions. He answers emails quickly. He does alot of interesting demos. His grading scheme is nice; grade is broken into 4 pieces: homework, midterm 1, midterm 2, and final exam (NOT cumulative). Your two best each count 35%, two worst are 15%. Very fair grading scheme. My only comment is that his final was really difficult, and I probably got like a 15% on it. Luckily, he seems to curve exams ...

Overall, very fair professor. I may take PHYS410 this fall with him if I can fit it into my schedule. I'd recommend him. ",292
jacobson_theodore,3,A,,"Okay professor, honestly pretty boring. But if you need to take for a CORE take this class! Its an easy A with Jacobson, you can miss quite a few classes and still get an A. He curves A LOT and puts a lot of weight on homework. Go to the weekly homework sessions, they are one hour and the TA literally just gives you the answers and you will get an A.",292
jacobson_theodore,3,B+,,"Nice guy and interesting class, although it is fairly time consuming if you want to do well and aren't scientifically inclined. He curves, since the whole class averages in the D range, prior to the curve, but we had a few obvious physics majors in the class who blew the curve since he averages the class to a B. Grades are 3 exams and weekly homework - my advice is to do put in the time to do well early with the home work and first few exams because the material gets harder. Fairly easy to get a B in the class, but it's hard to get an A.",292
jacobson_theodore,1,A,,"He's a nice guy and very reasonable, but honestly not the best professor. He's goes into much greater depth than he tests you on, and ends up confusing you in the process. You probably wont get an A.",292
jacobson_theodore,2,B,,"really boring class
does mainly demonstrations
but you can fall asleep very easily

kruskal,4,,CMSC451,"I strongly felt the particular content of this course is best (and easiest) learned through his whiteboard style rather than by book.  Clyde covers a TON of ground in one lecture's time, especially when compared to professors who just read off a watered-down powerpoint from the book for their entire class ""lecture"".  

The big caveat is if you have a lot of trouble following (at least roughly) what he's doing, it won't be much fun for you and you will feel lost all lecture.  Either way you need to write down literally everything he does.  The material can be hard to grasp, but Clyde is really great at walking through an algorithm.  If you take good notes and review them (possibly with another classmate/TA) you will eventually understand it.

The other most important thing to do in this class is to ask questions when something isn't clear.  In each class there's usually 2-6 little insights he forgets to mention, if you can catch those omissions and get him to explain them, you are a hero and it will be tremendously insightful for you and for every other student in the room.  Although if you still don't get his explanation, you may need to just let it go- and if you took good notes, you should eventually understand it when you are reviewing them later.

",293
kruskal,4,,CMSC351,"Clyde is actually very intelligent, and I found it fun to learn from him. While lectures aren't extremely helpful at the time of the lecture, going over the notes and understanding the semantics of every afterwards algorithm helps. Clyde will handwave some things in what he teaches because to him it's trivial. However if you go through the algorithms step by step, you can learn a lot and do well in the class. Overall the material was difficult, but the exams could be manageable given the right type of studying. ",293
kruskal,4,A,CMSC250,"Lecture:
Kruskal seemed to be a little out of his element this semester (Spring 2012). He supposedly never uses power point, but was forced to because Meesh said her class and his class had to keep up with each other. I didn't really learn much from the power point slides, most of the interesting tricks came when Kruskal would steer away and do one of his 'fun' problems. 
He was disorganized and late to every class. I honestly don't know how I learned during lecture, but I did. So I would suggest going to lecture (no pop quizzes or anything like that though). 

Homework:
Assigned weekly, and very hard. I took MATH310 and MATH406 (A+ in both) already, and I thought this homework was very difficult. 

Quizzes:
On Monday's during discussion. Usually pretty easy, just look over the slides.

Exams:
the midterms were long, I kind of finished them, but I didn't really get to check my answers.

Final:
He randomly gave us 2 hours and 7 minutes to finish the final. When I asked him why he just said ""I have my reasons"" which is the response he gives to just about everything...
The exam itself was not that bad, I got a 90% but the class average was a 60%. It was only a little bit longer than the midterms, but it was harder. 

**Finally I would like to say that I considered testing out of this class, since I was a math major I could have probably passed the placement exam. But I wanted the free 4 credit A. Turns out this class is not a free 4 credit A no matter how much math you know. Kruskal makes the homeworks too hard for that. That being said I think that you should take this class rather than test out of it, I learned a lot of stuff (especially Induction stuff, which isn't covered very well by the math dept. but Kruskal did a extensive covering of induction).

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
I also had Kruskal for 351:

He did a much better job in 351 than he did in 250. I think he just wasn't really into the 250 stuff. In 351 his exams and HW were very hard, but he curves like crazy so don't worry about it (like a 60% = B for our class). This seems weird, but it is done because it is hard to test algorithms. 

The only thing I didn't like was that there was one midterm that was 40% of my grade, the final was 50% and homeworks were 1% each.

On exams if you are asked to make-up an algorithm on the spot just make one that works and disregard efficiency, you get a lot of points for one that works. Efficiency will get you more points, but just move onto the next question and try for efficiency if you have more time at the end of the exam.",293
kruskal,2,A+,CMSC351,"Dr. Kruskal is a terrible professor. For algorithms, he did not teach nearly as much as any other professor. Looking at material from other semester, he did not cover as much material NOR covered it as deeply. He would refuse to do proofs under the mindset that they were not instructive. Even when he did attempt them, the proofs were so terrible I didn't even bother writing them down. He would always be minutes late, and would often spend the last chunk of classes doing unrelated material further wasting time.

This being said, our semester also had many terribly harsh graders for TA's. The class up to the final was pretty straight forward. The midterm was not too difficult, and the weekly homeworks were usually doable and he accepted resubmissions (and very late submissions). The final exam was incredibly difficult and harshly graded. The mean was a 45, and the final cut offs for passing the course was a 37, and for an A-, a 67.

In the end, going to lectures and doing the homework is still crucial. He does not offer any other manner of learning the little he did go over in the semester, such as online notes, so not going to lecture makes getting a decent grade nearly impossible. I would not recommend him. He makes the class just as difficult as the other professors, but you end up learning less in the end. It might be a little less work with the somewhat small weekly homeworks, but it is not worth it in the end.",293
kruskal,5,A-,CMSC250H,"It's very important to accept that Kruskal simply operates on a different wavelength from the average person. He's a true mathematician in the sense that he experiences life abstractly and disregards some aspects of interaction in favor of maintaining his flow of reasoning.

The honors section was an intimate and fun experience, and I can see how Kruskal might be more difficult in a large lecture, or with students who are less enthusiastic or willing/able to follow the material. So I highly recommend the honors class for the abstract-thinker. The assessments and graded assignments are the same, but you get to spend half the time solving logical puzzles.",293
kruskal,5,B,CMSC451,"Kruskal is great in this course. His policy on homework is great (hand it in whenever, no real due dates). You just have to make sure to keep yourself on top of it so you don't fall behind. HW is good practice of the concepts.

Exams are tough, but that's to be expected for this type of course. The questions are fair.

Most importantly, Kruskal makes the course very interesting by motivating the topics very well. He is also very good at explaining stuff, but you have to make sure to ASK him questions. Otherwise, he will breeze through the material and you won't understand anything. He is decent for help in office hours too.

My only complaint would be that he seems a little disorganized (just try visiting his office for example). However, he never lost any of my work, so this is not a big issue.",293
kruskal,3,B,CMSC250,"You have to work your butt off in this class because it is a hard class to begin with. But, to top it off, the professor doesn't teach well. Hopefully you have a good TA",293
kruskal,1,A+,CMSC351,"If you're not into math, STAY FAR FAR AWAY. The lectures are incredibly hard to follow, but attendance is still imperative to have any chance of success. The homework is quite difficult and extremely time-consuming; expect to spend 8 hours per assignment and to get a low grade. There is no indication of what to expect or how to prepare for the exams, but fortunately they were tempered significantly to make them fit into the allotted time. They're not easy, but they're not impossible either, which is all-important since the two exams are 90% of the grade.",293
kruskal,5,A,CMSC451,"This course was super fun! Easily my favorite course taken at UMD so far. It's a panorama of cool stuff in algorithms- I was continually surprised with intuitive tricks that are simple to explain but probably took months each to develop. They're priceless drips of distilled knowledge that you can't afford to miss if you're a CS major who plans to stop at your bachelor's degree. 

Kruskal communicates the course content clearly and with a refined taste for what's interesting. He seemed to care less about grades than most other professors, and gave a ridiculous curve. His marking is merciless though- if you do something wrong on a problem then you can expect a 0 or 50% grade for that problem.

The tests were hard, especially the final which was very hard. He puts heavy emphasis on proofs. ",293
kruskal,3,A,CMSC451,"My only real complaint about Kruskal is that he's probably too smart for his own good. Unfortunately, that impacts his teaching significantly. It's frustrating when he insists on only proving things a specific way, and this is the only class I've ever taken in which I really felt like I had to ask questions.

The exams were worth most of the grade which made it a little scary. But if you really do all of the homework on your own and study well, you should do well on the exams (at least relative to other people, which is what matters in this course with regards to your grade). Definitely go over all of the homework questions before taking the exams, and maybe do a few questions from the book.

Kruskal is very accommodating and cares a lot about his students. He clearly wants to see them do well. I definitely learned a lot in this course and was adequately rewarded for my efforts. It just takes a lot of getting used to his teaching style, and several hours doing and reviewing problems to prepare for the exams.",293
kruskal,3,B,CMSC451,"Class is hard so do not skip any lectures. There were only 4 homeworks but they were challenging and were used on the exams.

Midterm was 40%, homeworks 10%, final 50% of grade.

Many people drop this class because of his no-regard-for-human-life grading style.

I thought I'd fail with a 55 average on the midterm and final exam, but with his curve that was a B.",293
kruskal,2,A,CMSC351,"Kruskal comes from a long line of brilliant mathematicians and he is no exception. However, he forgets that not everyone, especially undergraduates, are not as brilliant as he is. His homework assignments were vague and sometimes his lectures would go off on vague tangents.

His midterm and final were very difficult. Average for both was about a 50. Granted, his curve is mean + std. deviation is the B/A line which is nice,  but still hard and stressful.

If he's your only option, you'll live. If you have other options, take them instead.",293
kruskal,3,A-,CMSC351,"The previous two reviews are probably accurate in the Clyde was frequently late, unprepared, and probably didn't care tremendously about the class. I won't lie. I hated the class while I was taking it. Didn't study enough for the midterm and did awful on it. Did really well on the final and ended up with an A-.

Look. He is clearly passionate about the material and he is actually decent at explaining it. As much as I hate to admit it, both tests were fair. You got a certain amount of points if you understood the homework and you could figure out the other problems on the fly if you generally understood the material.

Also, do yourselves a favor. Don't spout out that CLRS is a useless book too loud. It really isn't.",293
kruskal,1,,CMSC351,"No syllabus.
The book is useless.
He scribbles random gibberish on the board. Those are your notes for the class. 
His office is a mess, to say the least.
He doesnt give a damn. ",293
kruskal,1,C,CMSC351,"Kruskal is a terrible teacher. He never showed up to teach on time, always being five to ten minutes late. He was even late to the final exam. He didn't post the chapters that went along with the material he taught in class, so your class notes were your only study source. I approached him about this and asked if there was any material in the book I could use, and he replied that nothing he taught was in the book. On several occasions he taught the wrong material. The class had no structure, either a student would remind him where he left off the class before, or he would just start in a seemingly random place. The average on the midterm was a 50%, with the standard deviation being 25%. This meant that the grades were so scattered, that a 75 was an A, a 50 was a B, 25 was a C, and 0 was a D. He was such a bad teacher he made it impossible to get an F in his class.

TL;DR Kruskal is a scatterbrained, unorganized mess of a professor, and you should avoid him at all costs.",293
kruskal,4,A,CMSC451,"Kruskal is a great guy. I have had couple of classes with him, and I think he is definitely one of the better professors in the department. His class is entertaining and educational at the same time. Mind you, 451 is a hard class. You learn many complex classes of algorithms, and their mastery can only happen over time. The good thing is Kruskal understands this. His tests aren't super hard if you go through and understand his lectures well. He doesn't give very organized notes (mostly writing on board). Also, there were couple of times when he stumbled a bit solving some problem. But on the whole, I would recommend taking this any/all algorithms classes with him. Also has a decent grade curve. But go into this class prepared to see some really hard problems.",293
kruskal,4,A,CMSC351,"Professor Kruskal was a good teacher for this class. Especially when you consider that Prof. Golub is the other option. Kruskal taught pretty well. I think an average student should have been able to understand most of the topics we covered. Though his tests are not easy. They are between average and hard. He curves grades like most comp sci classes. For this class, make sure you do his homeworks and the practice exams. Though tests may not be very similar to them, but they do help you build a strong foundation for the test. 
He does show off his intelligence at times and can be slightly rude, but if you don't ask questions, you won't get much out of him any way. But he wants you to learn. Definitely recommended for CMSC351. He is after all related to the guy who came up with the famous Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. :).",293
kruskal,5,A,CMSC250H,"Dr. Kruskal is awesome. He is an excellent instructor and he presents the material in his own way (which many people may not like). He is a mathematician and he loves math. For the most part in 250H we did not cover ANY of the material that we needed to cover (we had to read everything from the book) However, we spent the time doing special projects that were so much fun and interesting that it was worth having to read the book for the actual course material. The projects were not graded but you get to argue with and against Dr. Kruskal and he is so much fun to argue with. Overall, Dr. Kruskal is really passionate about his math and he is very funny. (He is a little bit forgetful and rarely answers to emails, but he's just awesome!)",293
kruskal,3,A,CMSC250,"Heh, what can I say about Kruskal... first off, I had him for both CMSC250 and CMSC351. He seems very averse to doing work, and though he is very smart he rarely imparts this knowledge on students in a way that really impresses people. His lectures can be disjointed (he never has slides) and it can be hard to follow what he is doing, most of the class was not able to learn the material from the lectures.

On the other hand, if he likes the material, I feel like he is able to teach something. And he seems to be really passionate about algorithms. So there is a silver lining - if you understand and follow what he does, you can learn.",293
kruskal,3,B,CMSC351,"This class was one of the toughest algorithms classes I've ever had. Clyde is somewhat of a right of passage for UMD, but that doesn't make the class any easier. The professor is somewhat disorganized and gives bogus explanations for things, but you learn a ton about sorting/selection algorithms and complexities in the worst case for most things.

The first midterm from this semester was brutal (and I heard harder than last semester), and the average was a 56% with a standard dev of about 15 pts. The second better wasn't too bad and had a 68% with standard dev of 15 pts.

I've no idea how the final will be, but I know the class has become more lenient since 2010-2012, so I'm hoping not too bad. They'll apparently test you on MoM, graphs, minimum spanning trees, and np on the final. Good luck to anyone taking this class, and get a study group :)",293
kruskal,1,,CMSC351,"This man is terrible. His lectures are rambling, he is unhelpful, and he just doesn't give a flying fuck about you as a person. ",293
kruskal,4,B-,CMSC351,"Love the guy. He has an eccentric personality but if you get one on one time with him, get to know him and show genuine interest in the material, he is great. I retook this class after not passing over the Summer. Did much better the second time. 

If you have to retake a second time, fear not. Nearly everyone who retakes Kruskal does even better the second time around because he doesnt change a thing. Hes a creature of habit. The addition of a second midterm in the semester has helped the class be more ""pass-able"". Clyde is probably the best option for 351. His exams can be daunting in terms of how hard it makes you think, but it mainly just recycles some home work problems with different numbers and one coding interview question.

After getting a D+ the first time in the summer, I am expecting a  B- the second time around after the curve. It can be done!",293
kruskal,5,A+,CMSC351,"Kruskal is one of the best professors I've ever had. Is he easy? No. But his style, for me, just fits.

Everything he says has a logical purpose in the lecture. He not only explains everything that's done, but he also goes over it again if someone asks. He periodically stops and asks if everyone is following. If you are lost, and you aren't asking questions, that's YOUR fault. Not his.

Kruskal expects you to be intuitive. This may make some students struggle, but to be quite honest, it really comes down to how much work you put in to the class in order to gain that intuition on how to solve a problem.

60% of every exam is basically regurgitated homework problems. As such, if you fail this class, you simply aren't putting in the time to nail down the homeworks to perfection.",293
kruskal,2,,CMSC351,"I'd like to first clarify explicitly that this rating is of *the course itself* and my experience, and not Kruskal personally. ""Clyde,"" as I sometimes hear other students call him (not my style), is friendly, even solicitous, in person; although at times I was very frustrated with him I never had a bad impression of him as a person. 

But almost everything else about the course, including his teaching style, left me unhappy and on-edge. Among other things, at the end of the course I received a grade better than a B - the night before, I had calculated the likely cutoff for a C-, because I was *that* unsure where my not-yet-graded final exam performance left me. A member of my friend-group was dumbstruck to receive a 50% on one exam (exams are far-and-away the bulk of your grade in this course), only to discover that he had been misgraded by about 30% - that is, he actually earned an 80. 

To avoid going over-length with anecdotes, some key complaints/corresponding survival tips:

- TAs are perennially unhelpful (make sure you work with other students)
- Exam questions draw heavily on homeworks, so successfully understanding homework (no matter how vague or slow-grading TAs might be) is important to get done before exams
- Grading is slow and curves aren't specified until the very end (avoid panicking, and monitor where you are with respect to the average; for reference, 75% earned you an A in my semester)
- Make sure you understand the rudiments of calculus (how integrals are approximated with sums, for example) and summation-handling, because this knowledge will be largely assumed in derivations
- Our final exam was largely *not* cumulative, and what did show up was more trivia we'd all forgotten than anything substantive (all I can hint here is to take note of ""space complexity"" during the course)
- TAs frequently pull the hardest exam questions from websites like ""geeksforgeeks,"" interview-type questions for professionals; studying at least a few of these will give you a fighting chance of solving the problems in real time
- The textbook is sometimes helpful but always a pain to read; if you anticipate trouble, start reading in advance
- This course often tends towards the frustrating; instead, try to have fun - really the best thing about this course is it encourages on-the-spot facility with making a good algorithm to solve a problem you encounter, which is a cool skill to have

Sadly, I could still say more, but I think I've gone on long enough. Kruskal's course by reputation teaches you more than others - I'd certainly say so - but the stress and the ""on-your-own"" attitude mean that you have to be aggressive about making sure you understand well enough and have enough practice to acquit yourself well on exams. Truthfully, I can't say I recommend Kruskal's 351 - only that it is survivable if you bite down from the start.",293
kruskal,4,A,CMSC351,"Clyde is disorganized, and hard to communicate with for administrative issues.  He also gives the impression that he does not really care about his students.

Despite this, I think he explains the content of the course adequately.",293
kruskal,4,C,CMSC351,"This class is difficult no matter who teaches it. It is obvious Kruskal is an algorithms wizard and it worth taking his class, even if it mean night exams and long homeworks. Office hours are a must for this course but more enjoyable because of Clyde",293
kruskal,1,,CMSC351,"Kruskal is an awful educator, an irresponsible mathematician, and an unapologetic narcissist.
He asks questions in class, which is always a pain. Right before calling on you, he might say something demoralizing like ""I don't think you have the right answer, but go ahead and try."" After you answer, he may say something like ""I knew you had it wrong."" or ""Google will never hire you.""

Kruskal assigns a ton of homework. Be prepared to join a study group and meet multiple times a week and have no social life just to complete his homeworks - which, by the way are really vague sometimes. God forbid you ask him to be more specific with what he means on a question - he will say something like ""it should be clear from the context what I mean"". If you press him further, he will get even more annoyed at you, and never answer your question. The homeworks are vague enough so that a TA in office hours once had to announce to everyone that he instructed people incorrectly on a problem because of misinterpreting what kruskal called ""clear from context.""
A true mathematician is always very clear and specific when defining a problem that they're solving (or asking someone to solve) - it's arguably the most important part in solving a problem. Yet kruskal can't be bothered to specify what he means when his wording could mean two things reasonably and even a TA gets it wrong.
If you ever misinterpret kruskal's meaning from context, he will say you're cheating for not ""answering in the spirit of the question"". He thinks you purposefully misinterpreted the question to make it easier, or something.
Don't expect to be able to make regrade requests on much, either. He said something along the lines of ""don't make a regrade request just because a TA graded you more harshly than someone else. That's just life"". even though that is literally what capricious grading means and there are numerous policies against that and the instructional staff have an obligation to correct any capricious grading like that...

One time, he was working on a really hard problem in class. A student pointed out an error he made, and he said ""oh. i'm lost and confused. so you are all dismissed""
And we just left without the answer, never getting the answer. Kruskal spends all his time spouting nonsense about how students are always wrong yet he can't solve a problem he posed to us himself.

If at all possible, take 351 with someone else who isn't a d0uchebag who likes making his students suffer.",293
kruskal,1,C,CMSC351,Kruskal is genius but he lacks the ability to teach. He thinks we already know everything. I was in the TA room everyday to get my homework done and study for the exams. Phong saved our lives. Without Phong passing this class would have been impossible. He changed the structure of the class to help students. various office hours to get help. 5 starts for Phong.,293
kruskal,3,,CMSC250,"If you can take Jason Filippou instead for CMSC250, you should. Kruskal knows the material and can teach it, but he always complains about his lack of interest in CMSC250 and even when he teaches, skips over steps. He thinks that everyone knows about certain things, so he'll just skip over things, but most people attending the lecture may not know what he is doing. However, he does like to joke around and have some fun, so his lectures can be interesting on occasion. Normally, I attend his lectures and then look at Jason's slides on ELMS, which are more in-depth and have better examples. 

If you have to take Kruskal due to the fit of your schedule, you will be fine, but I hope that he has regained excitement in teaching CMSC250.",293
kruskal,5,A+,CMSC351,One of the better professors I've had at UMD CS.  He knows his stuff and is easy to understand and follow.,293
kruskal,2,A+,CMSC250,"Clyde's class is difficult. His homeworks are the same as Eastman's, but different from Jason's. I found that the ""prep"" and the self-study sheets that Jason would post around midterms or throughout the semester were very helpful if you did all the problems listed. Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.

As an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He'll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don't pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. 

Asking questions in class is good. He won't demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with ""I guess you really don't know anything."" It's objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA's will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.

My tips for surviving the Clyde:

1. I definitely wouldn't have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA's will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that's your thing hey more power to you.
2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn't do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.
3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.
4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that's why it seems like he's only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it's not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he's rambling.
5. Try to keep your cool. Clyde is so frustrating, I can't stress this enough, but if you're taking his class, the best you can do is get your bearings and learn more in-depth on your own time (which honestly can be during lecture).

I hated his class, but I'm taking 351 next semester with him because I'm a freshman and register last so wish me luck.",293
kruskal,3,B+,CMSC351,"Coming into this class, I knew what to expect with Kruskal because I had him for CMSC250. He seems like a great guy and he really knows what he is teaching, but I do not find him to be a good teacher. However, I can see why others would disagree. His lecture style seems to work very well for some and not at all for others. I definitely fall into the second category. 

Although I stopped attending his lectures early on, I was able to do well in the class by taking the homework assignments seriously, watching a lot of YouTube videos, and watching the Panopto recordings from the other professor. I don't mind learning this way and Kruskal's exams are very fair (even if they are hard) because they are based almost solely on the homeworks. But if you are someone who prefers to learn directly from the lectures instead of someone who learns by struggling through homeworks, I would not recommend taking Kruskal.",293

kruskal,3,A,CMSC351,"kruskal may be really tough and all, and sometimes doesn't completely finish the math when he does it on the board, but his tests are more or less an easier version of the homework. if you understand how to do the homeworks, you can get a decent grade on his tests. i'm not an extraordinary smart person but i didn't think this class was impossible, but again don't underestimate the class either, because some of the homework questions he asks can seem really difficult at times.  ",293
kruskal,4,A,CMSC351,"Great lecturer, with in general, fair exams. He doesn't award much if any partial credit, so it is important to be 100% confident in your answers. I thought that the course's logistics were not the best, even if they were done by the TAs and not Kruskal himself. We weren't able to get our homeworks back before the final for example, and the final took ~1 week to grade. The final was particularly brutal, with ~45% average, but the other tests averaged about 61%. The other exams felt very fair, and if you could do the homework, it shouldn't be bad. The final was not fair however, so you're always taking a risk on whether you're getting a reasonable exam or not.",293
kruskal,3,A,CMSC250,"Kruskal made it clear he was not too excited to be teaching 250 this semester. He is a knowledgeable professor but during lecture he would often refuse to answer questions and would sometimes make students feel unintelligent. He was not very responsive to students' concerns and the class was not very well run. If you take him make sure you attend lecture because he purposely does not record lectures and there are often no slides posted (and if they are, all the examples are absent and say ""do in class"").",293
kruskal,3,,CMSC351,"Sometimes he's a good lecturer, and sometimes he just rambles on and on about irrelevant content. Usually he is fairly entertaining when he does that.

A counterpoint to some of the Kruskal yay-sayers is that when you get to the gritty, Kruskal actually is a good lecturer. I honestly disagree, as Kruskal explained several key points terribly throughout the course, including but not limited to the tree method, several explanations about the existence of paths and the correctness of the MST algorithms, and solving optimization problems using decision problems using polynomial overhead (which is something that he stated will be on the final).

He is an average lecturer at best. The homeworks are decently challenging, but they don't help you learn the theory whatsoever. And honestly the theory for this course is extremely meager. To study for the final I made a topics list and it didn't even cover a full page of content.",293
kruskal,1,F,CMSC351,If you have class with Kruskal all I can say is GG,293
kruskal,1,B,CMSC451,Truly garbage. Doesn't teach anything--and what's worse--doesn't seem to care. Terrible organization and complete apathy.,293
kruskal,5,,CMSC351,"The disorganization complaint echoed across this website about 351 stems from a lack of communication between Kruskal and his TA's. There has been a few times where I would get marked off by TA's on homeworks because I did it differently than the grading criteria although I checked in with Kruskal beforehand and made sure my way was correct as well. Although the TA's regraded them, it shows the lack of communication. Also, posts on Piazza regarding how certain problems can be done are usually answered by the TA's with ""defer to Kruskal"". Like, bro, just make up your mind as a teaching panel and tell us, I don't need another side quest to find Kruskal and ask him the same question right now. 

Kruskal himself is a very knowledgable professor (dude has been doing research on this area for god knows how long, he's like a fossil). Some lectures he articulates the concepts very clearly and makes it very easy to understand, other lectures he leaves the class a little confused. When the latter happens, please go to office hours before complaining here. From what he told me, he only gets a few visitors per day (TA's might get more). I don't really understand how people can be blasting Kruskal for being a bad professor while they don't go to office hours for help. 

Unfortunately we can't rate courses, we can only rate professors, and Kruskal is one of the better professors in one of the worst-run courses.",293
kruskal,1,A-,CMSC451,While the content of this course is interesting the organizing and implementation is severely lacking. Professors and TA's should respond to students in a timely manner but in this class there was seldom any communication with the students on basic course information ,293
kruskal,3,P,CMSC351,"Professor Kruskal tries his best to teach the material, and he seems like a nice guy. He has his good moments, and it's in those moments where you can obtain a lot of knowledge about algorithms. However, there are also moments where he rambles a lot, which makes it hard to pay attention to the class. Make sure you try your hardest to understand the course material because it seems fascinating even in a hard class like CMSC 351.",293
kruskal,1,B,CMSC351,"please don't give last year record, really can't hear anything clear about it.",293
kruskal,3,B-,CMSC351,"Ok, so I know that Kruskal gets a lot of hate. His course is definitely disorganized and he does not spend lecture time actually teaching the stuff, rather going over other topics like probability and induction, and getting distracted by telling bad jokes. Homeworks were vague and were graded very late. Some TAs were great, but others were not really knowledgable. 

HOWEVER, I will say him and TAs are responsive on Piazza and gave reasonable extensions. Also, the biggest selling point is that his exam questions are almost always variations of the homeworks, which means you can predict what the exam questions may be like in advance. That is the single reason in my opinion why you'd want to take Kruskal over Teli, because his exams, the biggest part of the grade, are predictable enough to pass the class. ",293
kruskal,3,A,CMSC351,"I think Kruskal only half deserves the reputation he has (or that he and 351 jointly have). 

His lectures are not great. He often implicitly make assumptions in lectures, leaving you very confused if you don't see the implicit assumption yourself, because he will not clarify it unless asked. And even when asked he doesn't answer very well. I truly don't think he's being malicious, he just can't see student's train of thought and see where the reasoning is breaking down.

People who are reasonably ""smart"" (for some definition of intelligence) will probably see these assumptions and be fine in lectures, but people who are not will struggle with this.

I found the exams to be very fair. It might have been because of covid, but our exams did not include a challenge (or ""interview"") question. Instead they were mostly minor variations on homeworks.

Overall, I agree with the vocal majority that the course content is not taught well, but disagree that the exams are unfair.",293
kruskal,1,,CMSC351," If you don't want to fail, then run! No matter how much effort you put in the class is so poorly taught that you end up not learning anything. ",293
kruskal,1,D+,CMSC351,Took him during a pandemic because no other professors were available don't make the same mistake. he uploads pre-recorded lectures from previous years with horrible sound quality and the final was 45% of our grade. ,293
kruskal,4,,CMSC351,"Kruskal is a great person, and he's a really brilliant computer scientist. In terms of explaining material, he's pretty good as well. This semester he uploaded short video lecture videos asynchronously, which are great because they let you rewind whenever you want. His homeworks are like puzzles, but if you can talk them out with your friends you'll do a great job on them. MAKE SURE you find people to work on the homeworks with you! Otherwise, it's 10x harder to pass the class. 

Now for the negative about this class: The exams are fucking bullshit. Yeah, they are heavily based on the homeworks, however, the graders show no mercy on some questions. The format of the questions are in a way such that if you are blanking out on a how to solve the problem, you're pretty much screwed out of 5-10 percent of your final grade in the class. I studied and restudied for the final exam so much, but when it came around, I still met some problems where I understood the concept, but the algorithm for solving it, wasn't coming into my head. Personally, I don't know what more I could have done to prepare for the final, and I still got a pretty low score (I passed though). 

So in summary, clyde is a good professor who gives crazy ass exams. The exams are about 70 percent of your final grade, so make sure you know your shit thoroughly. But at the same time, make sure you are also very well rested before you take the final, or midterm. You want your mind to be on it's A game. 

The material of this class isn't really too hard to grasp and understand either. I thought that it was going to be based off 250, which I wasn't the best at, but it's a lot easier in my opinion. Just watch out for the exam questions!",293
kruskal,3,B,CMSC351,"Had him last semester. Everyone complains because they don't put in the work. I was busy with recruiting last semester so I prioritized that over school. But if you honestly keep up with the work and don't push all the studying until last minute you'll be fine. Everyone complains that the professor is ass but its because the concepts require actually thinking, whereas everyone is used to spoon feeding.

Regarding the TAs, its either a hit or a miss. They tend to grade relatively slowly.",293
kruskal,3,B+,CMSC351,"Class is definitely disorganized and needs a major restructuring. Despite this, I think when Kruskal is actually focused on lecturing, he explains things pretty well (like in his 15-20 minute recordings on specific topics). Exams were very difficult and worth way too much, but were modelled very closely to homeworks. TAs are hit or miss. 
You're likely gonna heavily rely on the 351 Bible (a large set of notes by a former TA that covers nearly every topic), along with some online videos for topics that you are confused about. If you do use these, though, you should be able to pass the class. ",293
kruskal,2,B-,,"Class is disorganized. Lectures with poor audio quality are used for actual class material to learn. Kruskal sometimes spends way too much time talking about jokes or other irrelevant matters. He is a smart guy and is nice, but the class could be run a lot better. Everything that people say about the tests is true. You can't pass this class if you don't put in hard work. ",293

I did take BC Calculus my senior year but after hearing from other students with different math profs, I got really lucky with Schlenoff. He really cares about his students and tries to make class fun (also tries to tell a math joke at the beginning of his class).

Lectures and notes are amazing. He writes out each step of problems and also goes over it again if you are still confused. Every problem he does is what you'll expect on the exams, quizzes, and final. TAKE NOTES IN CLASS.

His weekly homework quizzes are two problems and are easy if you DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS that he assigns optionally. The quiz is just two of those practice problems with different numbers so they should be an easy 10 points. He is also a very lenient grader.

His syllabus is really clear. He drops two of your lowest quiz grades and 3 WebAssign. The lowest of your 4 midterms will be worth half the points.

He responds really quick to emails and is always enthusiastic/approachable to ask questions.

The weekly quizzes are almost always based on the textbook practice problems from the syllabus so it's easy to do well on the quizzes. He doesn't have office hours but he is extremely responsive to email. He is chill and relatable and approachable and really is on the students' side. It's a shame his schedule only allows him to teach FC. Anyway, take Schlenoff.",296

You’d be better off pulling up the lecture slides on your own and working through the examples during class time. ",300
nau_dana,1,,CMSC722,"WARNING: Please avoid taking this course unless you are a RA for Prof. Dana Nau. There are so many great classes in UMD CS but this one is the worst even though Prof. Dana Nau is an AAAI fellow, outstanding researcher in this field, but it does not indicate that he is a great teacher. The reasons are as follows:

1. You can HARDLY learn anything new if you have taken an undergraduate level AI course except for fancy words that defines fancy planning and acting engines & models. You will NOT learn optimization techniques for AI planning but some bad framework that you will NEVER use. 
2. Unfortunately, Prof. Nau and the TA Dr. Vikas Shivashankar READ slides all the time. 
3. The book draft is not consistent from section to section and full of flaws.
4. The grading is a SUBJECTIVE procedure with no room for rebuttal. Worse still, the TA has the power to grade the exams as he wishes.
5. The professor simply IGNORES the students’ questions on Piazza nor email and seldom response in time.
6. The professor once was LATE for over 10 minutes for one Ph.D. student’s preliminary oral exam and everyone waited him.
7. The professor and the TA are MEAN to students and don’t recognize your previous efforts except for the raw subjective score, which is reasonable for undergraduate level class but definitely not for graduate level class. And this class limits A to a score of 93. 
8. The professor’s lecture often EXCEED the time by 15 minutes or less than. 
9. The professor never grades your homework nor explain homework very well.
10. The syllabus and the actual schedule are NOT consistent. 

However, every coin has two sides:

1. Prof. Nau is a famous professor in this field. Taking his class and getting an A will make your resume more remarkable to AI people.
2. You can learn how to formulate things and make ordinary programming style extraordinary using what is learnt in class, which most papers do. 
3. Prof. Nau gives us a good example of teaching lessons.

Homework sets took a bit of time to do, since there was a fair amount of having to review the slides repeatedly and first trying to understand the examples and reverse engineer them. Practice Midterm and Final Exams were given, but were much easier than the actual ones. Nau's justification was that they were all of 'easy' difficulty for him, so he didn't realize ours was harder.

-Grading was not prompt at all, project 2 of 3 was finally graded just a few days before final
-Homework solutions are not posted, and homework is only returned if you go to TA office hours
-Project 3 was based on TensorFlow, which the professor admitted ""I don't know anything about and won't be able to help you. Just read and work through the tutorials""

-Going to lectures isn't a good use of time
-Projects are all group based and project 3 was absurdly difficult with no guidance",300

I really kind of wish that they didn't go over as much First Order Logic in the course but other than that he really paid attention to student concerns, was lenient with deadlines and frequently added extensions. If you had a question in class he would stop everything and made sure you understood the material and would readily go over anything anyone asked to.

The project was pretty fun actually and I've heard a few people talk about how it was nice to have a project that actually demonstrated AI and was something they could show to their non-CS friends.

I would recommend taking this class with Dr. Nau!",300

In addition, expectations on projects and how they would be graded was not communicated well at all. With no semblance of tests to evaluate your performance, you just had to write something and hope whatever arbitrary grading scheme worked in your favor, if not then oh well. For this reason many people ended up with very low scores in the class, despite putting in a lot of effort.

butts,5,,,"I actually enjoyed neurophys with Dr. Butts. He is clearly very passionate and extremely knowledgable about the subject. He's also super nice! 

I can see how this class may be challenging though. The lectures are delivered like scientific talks (a lot of figures and little words) so you must understand and not just memorize everything.

He truly wants every student to do well and his tests are very fair based on what he emphasizes in class. As long as you go to class and show him that you actually care, you'll be totally fine in one of his classes.

falvey,5,A,CHEM241,"Dan Falvey is a legend. If you have the opportunity to take him, TAKE HIM. The guy is amazing for orgo II.

Exam Format: 
-Two pages of straight-up reactions. One is usually not straightforward, the rest are easy.
-Two mechanisms, pulled directly from the practice problems, or very similar to the practice problems. One is usually a simple one that he's shown in class, and the other is usually a complicated one from his practice problems.
-Two syntheses. Pulled straight from the notes or the practice problems. Instead of copying exactly what he gave you in the practice test, he might just include the ""tricks"" in the problem but not the exact same molecule or something.
-A short answer. This is what separates the men from the boys. Half the time, you have no idea what he's going to ask. Look at old tests. He loves asking questions about acidity, and for the second test its almost always about Oxygen18 labeling

The tricks to get an A:
1 Know absolutely EVERYTHING on his practice test he puts online. Seriously, look at other reviews, what they're saying is true. He pulls so much from the practice test, and the rest is variations of the stuff he has on there. There is maybe one question that won't be on his practice tests that are pulled from the book, but if you understand the concepts behind what you're being tested on, you'll be fine and you really don't need to do the book problems unless you want more practice
2 Keep a few separate pieces of paper at the end of your notes dedicated to copying down the synthesis problems he shows you in class. Almost always, at least one will appear on the test (he usually shows about 4 or 5 per exam). 
3 Keep another couple pieces of paper for the mechanisms he shows you in class. He'll probably ask about an easy one that he showed you in class.
4 Make sure you look over the emails he sends out. They're really annoying, but I know in previous years he's pulled short answer problems from the stuff he sent out. This year, he didn't really pull anything from his emails for the tests, but they did make the stuff we were learning seem less dull.

In class, he goes over a LOT of theory that's pretty much unnecessary to do well in the course. Just copy down the syntheses and know the mechanisms of the reactions he goes over. Mainly focus as much as you can on the practice tests, and start reviewing for the tests a week in advance. He usually hosts a review session the Friday or Thursday before his exam, make sure you've attempted all his practice problems before then, so that you can get the answers for the ones you don't know at that time.

^^ Do that stuff, which seems like a lot written out but isn't all that much to do well in an Orgo course, and you'll get an A guaranteed. Clicker questions aren't worth studying for in my opinion, when you can just do the four things listed and get a easy grade. To do well on clickers would require a lot of studying before class and constant review and doing the book problems and staying up to speed in the book with respect to lecture, and its just not worth it. I didn't do any book problems the entire semester. I only used my book to go over mechanisms that he drew kind of confusing in class. I don't recommend studying from the book, you'll go over a lot of material you don't need to know.

So, the man basically gives you everything you need to do well on a silver platter. All you need to do is review the practice sheet about eight times and understand everything on it and you already are guaranteed a high C without the curve. Do everything else and you have an A.

Dan Falvey is the man. He's always joking in class and points people out by name. He teases everyone and makes fun of himself, and is a downright genius when it comes to Orgo. He eats paper and makes sure no one feels stupid. Great teacher, great guy. Take him.",303
falvey,5,A+,CHEM241,"Dr. Falvey is an energetic and knowledgeable teacher. I highly recommend taking Organic Chemistry II with him. He sure makes the topic interesting! Tests consisted of matching structures with names for interesting compounds, identifying reagents/reactants/products, mechanism problems, synthesis, and qualitative problems. To get an A in his class, you have to go to lecture, take good notes, read ahead, and demolish those clicker quizzes. He has a straightforward grading policy and he grades the exams VERY quickly. Dr. Falvey is certainly a good teacher to take if  you have Organic Anxiety and need someone who can make this otherwise tasteless subject somewhat palatable. ",303

He is very funny and entertaining. Very knowledgeable which explains why he will go off on tangents from time to time because he is so passionate about organic chemistry.

You must work hard in this class though. Organic II is not meant to be easy but it is certainly doable. There are 3 midterms (150 pts each), 1 final (300 pts), 1 diagnostic exam (assesses orgo 1 background), and clickers (extra credit). 

Overall, very enthusiastic and caring professor who will do whatever it takes to get you an A or B.",303
falvey,5,,CHEM241,"Awesome!  He is definitely the guy to take Orgo II with.  Great lecturer, really funny and entertaining, and the lectures seem to move a lot faster than with other chem professors'.  
He really cares about his students.  There is both an upside and downside to this.  Be prepared for class, because by that, I mean he goes through the roster on the first day, tries to get to know everyone's name, and in class, he WILL call on you at least once.  It doesn't matter that there are 200 other people in the class.  You will be called on.  ",303
falvey,4,B,CHEM241,"Prof. Falvey is a great professor. He is funny, cares about his students, and extremely knowledgeable. Exams are fair and looking over previous exams really helps. 

The only thing that didnt work for me is the curving system. 10% below the 5th highest score will earn you an A. Unfortunately, the 5th highest score was somewhere around a 94% this semester. That means messing up on one exam will cost you. So Falvey's averages tend to be higher than other classes, but his curve is almost always lower.

Very easy to get a B, the A cutoff will depend on that 5th score...",303
falvey,5,A,CHEM241,"Dr. Falvey is a great professor! He is funny, straight forward and teaches pretty clearly. The only thing is that his hand writing was not too good for me though.

I recommend to read before going to lecture (even though I never did). Since there is not much time, not everything is covered clearly. The book is kinda helpful in explaining stuff that I didn't get in class. The books problems don't really help in my opinion but more practice is better. 

His exams were ok if you study. He gives out practice exams before each exam and about ~50~60% is from the practice exam! And sometimes he gets a bit lazy and steals the problems that our TA Derek(One of the best TAs ever!) made up and  gave us for practice. 

For practice exams, I remember he gives them out 2 weeks before the exam and gives out hints via email. He gives out the answers 2 days or so before the exam. I recommend start doing the practice exams right after and make sure you understand each question instead of looking at the answers the night before. I think it's important to understand and know how to draw the mechanism for every reaction instead of memorizing them. 

I don't really remember the averages but I think they where around 65~70%. For me I got high Bs in all of them, got a A on the final and had a A without the curve.  

For the final, redo all his exams, practice exams, practice sheets that the TA gave. Go over notes and clicker quiz questions. It's a lot of work but as long as you understand all those. You will do fine. 

Dr. Falvey is a really nice professor, although I never went to his office hours (he calls on ppl in class if he remembers you from his office hours so be careful!) The shocking thing about him was once when we were talking about cellulose, he ripped a piece of paper and started chewing O___O",303
falvey,4,,CHEM241,"Coming from someone who is awful at organic, he's a very good professor. He is very nice and extremely enthusiastic He likes to go off tangents, but they normally relate to the topic. His exams are things we've seen before. Half the answers are already in the notes he gave in class. As long as you understand the topic and don't just try to memorize things you should do well. However, I hated his grading system. Top 5 grades gets an A+, next 10% gets an A and so on. Oh yeah, he has clicker questions that are considered extra credit at the end of the semester",303
falvey,4,C+,CHEM241,"Good professor. Very nice, tends to ramble from time to time but gets the message across. Go to office hours, he's very helpful and he puts up old tests to study from. No matter who you take orgo with it's gonna be hard so study for it every day, no joke. Tests are fair.",303
falvey,5,A,CHEM241,"FANTASTIC lecturer. He is Santa Claus. (you'll get this on the first day if you take him). 

He's genuinely a nice person and teaches very well. There's definitely a reason why there was a 40 pt discrepancy in averages between Falvey and Issacs during this semester. Falvey does NOT throw in any low blows on his exam - he tests you on what he teaches and what he asks you to practice.

I highly recommend him for Orgo II!",303
falvey,4,C,CHEM241,"I did not do so well in his class because I completely panicked on the final exam like a punk. Too bad the final exam was everything we had already been tested on. Go to every lecture, every discussion, and study the practice exam problems, synthesis, and mechanisms. He doesn't surprise you on exams, which is great. I would have gotten a B had I been a better student. Overall, he is a great professor!",303
falvey,5,A,CHEM241,"Best orgo professor out there, really just makes the material easy to learn.  Exams are variations of the practice exams, with a few curve balls here and there, but if you follow the logic of the practice problems, and understand them, you'll be fine. Similar to Dixon in that he really enjoys the material and enjoys teaching, unlike some of the other orgo professors here.",303
falvey,5,A,CHEM241,"Phenomenal professor. He's clear, succinct, and extremely engaging. He emphasizes the WHY and the HOW of organic chemistry and less of the WHAT. Memorization in his class only takes you so far. Overall, I can't even count the times I completely lost track of time when listening to him. 

Coming out of the class I REALLY felt I knew organic chemistry. Let's put it this way: by popular standards Dixon is supposed to be a great teacher. She really isn't worth the chalk he writes with. 

His exams are not easy, as shown by the relatively low averages. However, they're very fair and will reward those who study for them. He likes to send out lots of practice problems. They're really not a waste of time, considering he pulls about 60% of the exam material directly from them. 

I really agree with the below review - Falvey actually tests you on what you learn in class. There are no surprises going into the exam. 

I did have one small issue with him - his curving system is really wacky. Basically, 10% below the 5th highest score in the class in an A. You can imagine just how problematic it can get when the 5th highest score is over 90%. 

Overall: I will take any possible class he'll teach in the future. 
",303
falvey,5,A+,CHEM241,"Falvey is a great professor! At times, the work does seem overwhelming, but he explains everything very well. 

As long as you do all the homework and practice problems, you should be fine. About 60% of the exam questions come directly from the practice problems, and the others are slight variations.  Unlike other professors, he actually tests you on what you learn in class, and does not try to trick you. ",303
falvey,3,A,CHEM241,"Very enthusiastic BUT he can be TOO much sometimes and unorganized.

Tests are okay. 
Make sure you study for them.",303
greene_richard,5,B,,"I'd like to preface this review by saying that I'm an english major, and that I can't handle basic math and the concept of physics blows my mind in general.

That being said, Professor Greene made physics one of my easier classes of my semester. He's extremely helpful in class as long as you ask questions (he can't read minds), and even if you don't particularly understand lecture he always does demonstrations of the concepts he's going over which REALLY help, especially like me if you're more of a visual and hands-on learner. 

Homework grades are based on effort rather than whether you're right or wrong (occasionally I wrote a paragraph of straight gibberish because I had no idea what the answer was and still got full credit). 

There's a quiz every week on the homework, but it's only 3 multiple choice questions and you get 1 point for just taking the quiz. He takes the quiz grades for each student and adds them all up at the end of the semester and puts a giant curve on them, so getting a 1/4 doesn't hurt you. The average is usually a 2/4 or so which ends up being around a B at the end of the semester. 

Everyone fails the exams, but some exam questions are the same as the ones he puts on the quizzes so those are free points, plus he has a review session before the exams where he'll hint at things that'll be on the exam that he doesn't mention in class, so go to those. Like the person below me said, the exams get a HUGE curve because as I said everyone fails. The average on our final was a 20/35 which ended up being around an 85% or so.

Basically, if you're going to take any non-lab for CORE, take this class with Greene. It was the only class I didn't skip all semester because I actually enjoyed it.",304
greene_richard,5,A-,,"Great class; great teacher,if you put in 40 minutes a week doing your homework assignment you will get an A. You will need yo attend class 75% of the time. ",304
greene_richard,5,A-,,"Professor Greene is an amazing professor and he really makes the class engaging through his demonstrations. One demonstration I still remember was when he accidentally or purposefully exploded a thick pipe by exposing it to liquid nitrogen. The entire class jumped. Lol. Another one was when he popped a hydrogen balloon.

All in all, this class is pretty easy as long as you attend the discussions, pay attention in class and read the book. The homework were an easy give-away points. He graded those based on completion. Quizzes and exams were tough but he followed it up by giving a massive curve in the class. I don't know how big the curve was but he said that average for exams and quizzes counted as a B+ even though if the average was in 40s or 50s. So, just hope to do better than the class average and you should walk away with an A.

I definitely recommend everyone to take this class with Professor Greene.",304
greene_richard,5,A-,PHYS272,"Amazing professor! He made a hard class easy to understand, and covered topics in a way that kept me constantly engaged. ",304
greene_richard,5,B-,PHYS272,Probably the first teacher to make super complicated ideas seem so simple and then make them really hard on the test again if you do not study properly. Otherwise he is an amazing professor that makes the subject actually interesting!,304
gruner,3,,BSCI361,"This class is not too difficult. A lot of the material is a review from BSCI106, but the material is very interesting. The course consists of two midterms and one final, which is not cumulative. There is also a term paper, which is graded leniently, and weekly online assignments for discussion. You must attend discussion because attendence is part of your grade. It is also important to attend lecture because there are usually clicker questions, which you get credit for answering (right or wrong). However, Gruner's exams were frustrating. He said that in previous years he gave out too many A's in the course, so perhaps he wanted to make it more challening. I did not think that this was very fair. I did well on the exams, but it seemed impossible to get an A on them. The average for my class on exams was a low B. I maintained an A in the course the entire semester, but dropped to a B+ after the final because I only received a low B on it. It was very annoying to do well in a course but then lose out because of the final. Gruner needs to reconsider his letter grading. Other than that, he is a very nice professor and very approachable. ",305
gruner,5,A,BSCI361,"Excellent course on ecology.  Good basis for if you're looking to do something worthwhile with your life and following your passion versus what your parents told you to do.  His exams were fair, and we actually did better on them than he expected (go us!).  Material was straightforward and from the book, nothing too tricky.  I participated because I found the subject interesting, and really wouldn't have cared what grade I got because I left this class feeling like I learned some very valuable information. That's the point of education, no?  I also realize there's no such thing as ""too nice"" but if dr. gruner could have that title, he would. Great guy.  My only complaint was that it was sort of annoying having premed students asking about grades and curves all the time..",305
gruner,2,B+,BSCI361,"AVOID THIS CLASS/AVOID DR. GRUNER. Okay, so granted Dr. Gruner may be a really nice young man, but he just can't teach, he can't write exams, and the class is a mess.  I am a GENB major (pre-med) but unlikely all of my other Bio classes, this one is so heavily filled with weird Ecology/Evolution majors aka tree-huggers. They all know how these Ecology classes work so they did very well on the exams (averages were alwasy 82%+). Hence, there was no curve. Until at the end of the semester when he promised a 4-8% curve. But, he UNDERestimated how the class would do on the final (everyone did so well, not surprising) and so he ""lied,"" he upset many students, ruined people's grades, and ended up curving a mere 1%, hence why I have a B+.  I put a TON of effort into the discussion, you have to read dense/pointless articles, write summaries, and do a term paper. Dr. Judy Che led the discussion and she is so great/energetic, too bad she couldn't teach the course itself. Dr. Gruner put people to sleep, about 15 people showed up to every class sadly. And going to class doesn't help since he is TOO nice, and only puts things on the exam that is IN THE BOOK. I repeat, READ THE BOOK. He's not a good Bio professor, like Dr. Ades (and other seasoned faculty) who test on material mentioned, and on material outside of the book. Dr. Gruner is a straight from th ebook guy, but that doesn't help since the book is poorly written and there is WAY TOO MUCH material per exam. Overall, over this class and avoid Dr. Gruner. HE is a nice guy, but doesn't know the importance of grades for pre-med students. This is completely ridiculous, I got A's in classes like BSCI330, BSCI433, BSCI410, and pulled off a B+ in this supposedly joke class. Good luck folks!",305
gruner,5,A,BSCI361,"I love Dr. Gruner! He is not the most interesting professor all the time, but he is super genuine and really cares about his students success. The class was not too hard and he let us drop up to two of the four exams depending how many projects we did. He is very supportive and has done some really interesting research, and is very passionate about helping students apply the class to real world scenarios. Classes involved readings before coming to lecture and an 8 point quiz, but you can retake the quiz once and everything was open note and open book. ",305

Just don't expect to learn from lectures.",307
gunatilleka,2,B+,MATH240,"Danul is a great person, but as a lecturer isn't very engaging. Most of the semester I have spent learning the course material on my own because I don't get too much out of his lectures. If you have questions for him he is always good with answering them.",307

buehrle,3,A-,PHYS161,"He's terrible at teaching. His lectures are so vague and he never does examples. I give him three stars because his class wasn't too hard.

buehrle,5,A,PHYS132,"Buehrle is your best bet with physics II. We tend to repeat material in class from the class before and after, which helps enforce the topic. The class didn’t seem to be a lot of work besides the lab, which will never not be a pain in the ass, but at least there is no take-home work from lab. Honestly the key to success with either physics for the life sciences (I or II) is to do well on the homework. Find a group of friends and work on it together, and go to office hours with a TA who seems the most competent. And hint hint, the homework get reused usually each semester. Overall I would recommend taking PHYS132 with Buehrle, seems like a pretty chill and nice guy.",308
buehrle,5,A-,PHYS132,Great professor. His motto is: ZERO STRESS. He recycles A LOT of clicker questions on his weekly quizzes and on his exams. Great at answering questions and responding to student concerns. And he doesn't use those annoying white boards from 131 which is awesome! ,308
buehrle,1,A-,PHYS161,"I never leave reviews for professors unless I have a bad time. I had a bad time with this guy.

This guy straight up gives you old AP Physics C problems as exams. Those by themselves are hard. He does not actually teach anything, especially as an introductory Physics class. All he does is derivations on the board. I went to every lecture and it seemed like the time spent in class did not help at all and was a complete waste of time. All in all, bad teacher and really hard exams. Reading the book and watching videos helps a bit.

Weekly quizzes which are usually pretty hard and can rarely be done in the time given. Discussion is utterly useless as all you have time to do is take the quiz then go over the answers to the quiz after it is collected.

Now, after all this there is a pretty big curve. Be aware the final is really hard. I would recommend just doing old AP Physics C Free Responses to prepare for the exams. 

I worked really hard in this class and was able to pull off an A- in his class after the curve but if I had the option to take it with someone else that actually teaches, I would. (Side note: This guy is treats guy and girls completely differently -- to the point where me and several other students in lecture would pick up on the way he would talk to guys as opposed to the way he talked to girls.)",308
buehrle,5,B-,PHYS161,"He is engaging and enthusiastic in his teaching. Grading was fair with the exams being manageable. I'll say the same for quizzes.

It's important to actually do the homework problems and GSS worksheets. If you practice until you can get the answers without error, you will get an A in the class. I became lazy and started googling the homework answers since they are all online. Still managed a B in the class.

I should mention this is my third physics class since I am a biology major and the material in this was a bit different.

Definitely would take a another class with him.",308
buehrle,3,A,PHYS161,"Buehrle was a decently dynamic teacher, but ultimately lectures were superfluous and I rarely went. Having taken AP Physics, I was quite bored by the class and he didn't do enough to change that. This would've been fine, but his mastering physics homeworks were ridiculous. They would often take hours and be significantly harder than anything he had talked about in class. On top of this, his exams were laughably difficult and the averages seemed to generally fall in the 60s. I don't feel like I learned the material well at all. That being said, the curve is definitely in your favor and relative to what I've heard of other teacher's for 161 you could do far worse.",308
buehrle,5,A,PHYS121,Buehrle is a top notch professor. His lectures were very interesting and he is a really nice guy. His tests got progressively more difficult but he is a fairly easy grader. ,308
buehrle,3,B,PHYS161,"First, you are going to have endless amounts of Mastering Physics. It sucks. They take 2-5 hours depending on the week and your Googling ability. They don't match up all that well with the difficulty and style of the problems you get in class.

Second, he does not go over many examples in class, and mostly does formula derivations, which is not very helpful for learning how to actually do the problems.

Third, his exams are really hard. People walk out and say ""I don't know if I got a single point."" They are all curved, usually a lot, so there is no final curve on the class. Many people had already learned the material but the University did not give them AP credit, so that messed up the curve.

Fourth, he is an engaging and energetic lecturer. He likes to bring in demonstrations that are not necessarily helpful, but at least interesting. He lets class out 10-15 minutes early almost every day.",308
buehrle,5,A,PHYS161,"Buehrle is such a nice, straightforward person. He's teaching style is slow but thorough. If you've gone through AP Physics B you'll be fine for most of the course (you can probably skip most lectures and be fine on the exams). If you've never had physics before, he is also a great choice because of how thorough. 

I definitely recommend him.",308
buehrle,5,A,PHYS161,"Buehrle was a very straight forward and easy to understand professor. He explains everything VERY slowly compared to physics professors I've had in the past, which is good when you get into slightly more complicated topics. He's also easy to approach and is probably the least condescending professors I've ever had.

His tests are more difficult and fast paced than his teaching style would suggest, but they are graded leniently. I'm usually decent at predicting my test scores, and I was confident I got a C or B at best on each test, but I actually got all As BEFORE the curve. The curve on each exam was around 10%. The tests did have a lot of questions without numbers, which could be a problem for some people.

I noticed the reviewers that complained were in 121 or 122. I took those classes when I was a biology major, so I'm guessing they are also bio majors. I met a lot of bio majors while getting my microbiology degree at umd, and I hate to generalize, but a large percentage of them are incredibly lazy when it comes to certain classes (mainly pre-meds who want the glory of being a physician, but don't want to put in the work). My point is, don't judge Buehrle by those reviews.

P.S. The last paragraph wasn't meant to offend pre-med students. There are plenty of hard working pre-meds who will be great physicians one day!

buehrle,2,B+,PHYS122,"Ouch this guy is so outta whack. Do your GPA a favor, take someone else. His exams are all over the places. If your physic is semi ok, you'll feel like crap when taking his exams. I don't understand why he doesn't write his own exam that is related to what's teaching in the classroom, but instead he takes some questions from college board website, probably copy and paste and said he wrote them. At the end of the class, I think he curved like 1% or something geez. ",308

buehrle,5,A,PHYS121,I also disagree with the first review of the professor. He is one of the kindest individuals I've ever met and explains the concepts very well. His tests are not too difficult. Physics is one of those subjects you either get or don't. I would say I'm usually one of those students who wouldn't get it...but I truly excelled in this course. If you have taken physics in high school...then you will do absolutely fine. Usually 800+ out of 100 points is an A.,308
buehrle,4,A+,PHYS121,"Buehrle is the king. 

Pros: EXTREMELY nice, presents the material in an understandable, friendly way. Tries to make sure all of his students get a concept before he moves on. He also curves a BOATLOAD apparently. He says an 80 is rounded to a 90, and looking at his stats in our umd he is really generous. Also, his homework is graded on completion and not correctness.

Cons: Dude teaches you AP Physics. Straightup. He uses old AP physics questions for his own exams, and his final. You can google the questions from his key and ap exams from like eight years ago show up. This is a royal pain when you're studying class notes and from the book and he asks you something that you've never come across before, which none of the other current phys professors do. However, there's usually only one or two of those on each test, and other than that they're OK.

IMPORTANT note: Make sure you have the old exams when taking this class. He reuses a lot of his questions, and this is pretty convenient. What I found was the best way to study was to study old exams, notes, old AP physics problems, homeworks. That's listed in order of importance.

I walked away with a decent understanding of basic physics and an excellent grade (I got about 910 points looking at my total grades)

Make sure you do the force and motion survey at the beginning, it's worth like 1.5%",308
buehrle,5,A,PHYS121,"I completely disagree with the above review about this professor.  He explained concepts very thoroughly and made lecture both fun and enjoyable (which is difficult especially for a 2 hour lecture).  He is very responsive to students who do not understand the material, and knows how to teach it better than some of the other professors because he used to teach high school (so he isn't mainly a researcher).  His tests and quizzes were difficult, but fair.  If you did the practice problems he gave you then you would do fine.  Clearly he is not too difficult a grader because his grade distribution is all A's and B's.",308
buehrle,1,C,,"For the record, it should be said that physics is my weakest and least favorite subject and I hope to not come off as bitter in this review. Buehrle is a friendly and funny guy, but when it comes to teaching physics, he is not that good. I tried my best to learn the material from the lectures, but I guess I just don't get it like everyone else does. A lot of the time, it seems like he just talks about the problem but doesn't do them out completely. His exams were pretty challenging and they were both heavily curved. 

Honestly, my only advice is to grind through his class and watching videos like Khan Academy on YouTube and hopefully you'll do better than I did. I regret not taking Hailu Gebremariam because I have heard that his section is having a better time than I am. Also, it should be said that my experience is not representative of everyone else's experience, and best of luck if you take him.",308
buehrle,1,B,PHYS161,"You’re 100% not going to take anything from this class. I would honestly say he is the worst professor I’ve had at this university, and it’s a shame because he’s a nice guy and says funny things and engages the class - all building façade that you might be learning something useful or that those practice problems you just went over or the demo he did will end up being beneficial. The BAM here comes midterm number 1 ready to just bend you over and dilate your orifices until you walk out of the lecture hall physically and emotionally drained, wondering how you got to that point, and whether or not you’ll ever make it as an engineer when you thought you studied and prepared for this exam only to stare at the first problem and then at your formula sheet and realize you didn’t learn a damn thing in this class and it’s only getting worse from here on.

For anyone discouraged after taking this course, PHYS260 is arguably harder in terms of content, but so long as your professor actually teaches you things they test you on, then you’ll be fine. 

Just rely on Buehrle’s curve to pass this class, I’d honestly say it’s impossible otherwise unless you took physics in high school. ",308
buehrle,3,A-,PHYS132,"He is a pretty good lecturer but the class is still difficult. Reuses a lot of questions on clickers, homework, quizzes, and exams. One nice thing is that the exams do not count for a large percentage of the final grade. The exams have way too many questions to get done in the time period allotted. ",308
buehrle,3,A,PHYS161,"The lectures were boring and long, but the homework was easy. However, the exams were tough. He gives a good curve because the average was low, but you still have to put in effort to get a good grade",308

buehrle,3,A-,PHYS161,"He's a funny and nice guy, but with this class, you get what you put in. The lectures are mostly pretty boring and the exams are pretty tough. There is a curve for the exams tho, plus he drops 1 of the 3 exams since the other physics professor only gives 2 exams. ",308
buehrle,5,A-,PHYS161,"Buehrle is a chill professor who makes the occasion physics jokes. The homework is easy, but the exams are usually pretty difficult, but he always curves the average to around 80%",308
buehrle,3,B+,PHYS161,"The first thing people think about Professor Buehrle is that he looks like Mark Hamill. Aside from that, Buerhle is a laid back professor, and teaches similarly to AP Physics C. The notes were not too helpful with homework, but was doable. Exams were difficult, but he always curves to make the average 80%. Since quizzes were online, there was nothing to do in discussions, and therefore were pointless, unless you had a homework question.",308
buehrle,3,B-,PHYS161,"David Buehrle is a pretty nice guy, but his lectures were pretty boring and not too helpful; most of the content was ripped straight out of the textbook (including examples), and he didn't start doing more beneficial examples until halfway through the course. 
His online lectures were about the same as in-person. Homework was fairly straightforward and easy, but it took a lot of time to do. Exams were probably the worst part of the course: they either escalated the difficulty of problems or didn't give enough time to complete everything and check your answers. The raw average scores of most of the exams were in the upper 50's to lower 60's; however, he curved exams by 20-30% (around the average), which was a blessing.

Overall, I didn't learn too much from his course, but I had taken AP Physics (so it wasn't utterly terrible). Since this is a requisite for engineering majors, I wish you the best of luck!",308
buehrle,5,A,PHYS270,Buehrle was great. Online lectures were helpful and frequently ended early. OH were helpful and he was cool. Exams were standardized and on ExpertTA,308
buehrle,4,A-,PHYS131,This class was super chill. The class focused more on theory than doing math (great for me because I suck at math!). The homework and weekly quizzes can be difficult but he repeats very similar questions on his exams. His online lectures were reused from spring and summer sessions. This made me feel disconnected from the class which was hard for me mentally and made it difficult to stay engaged. Online lab was fine because there is no work outside of the lab. You work with your assigned group over zoom through out the semester and everything is done on the computer. You can put in some effort and do fine. ,308
buehrle,4,A-,PHYS161,"As far as the quality of physics lecturers goes, Buehrle's probably up there as one of the better ones. Pretty entertaining guy in-person. His exams were somewhat challenging but he infamously had really generous curves on them. The flipside is this meant he didn't curve final grades, no matter how close you may have been to the next grade cutoff...",308

He gives really fair assignments and will literally explain everything about it if you go see him in office hours. 400 points in total. 100 h/w. 300 pts equally for exam one, 2 and 3. >85% guaranteed an A. Beyond that there's a curve. I mean seriously, what more could you want from a 400 level bchm course really?",310

hawthorne,5,A,BSCI126,"Cares about his students and wants to get to know them, easy to do well with little/no effort, you can learn a lot if you just try a little bit

skim the readings and know what they're about and you'll do fine",311
hawthorne,4,A,BSCI126,"I would not agree with the review below me. While I did receive an A in the class, i wouldn't say it required no effort. It is not the hardest class I have ever taken, but if you put in the effort there is no reason you should not receive an A. 

There were 2 tests during the semester as well as a final project. The project was decently demanding but if you go into professor Hawthorne he will help you. There were also other assignments over the semester that were decently long but not difficult.

In terms of Dr. Hawthorne, he's great. He was nice, approachable, and a great teacher. That being said, with the class being a lecture with at least 80 students, I would definitely recommend making sure he knows who you are- it definitely helps.

All of that being said, the entire and your grade depends very much on your TA. If your TA is hard, I would say that the class would be. Overall good class and great teacher",311
hawthorne,5,,BSCI126,"This class was extremely easy. Literally required almost no effort.

There is 1 exam. The rest of the class you work on a group project. Pick a good group-- you will work with them all semester.

He is also super nice and is responsive to his students concerns. He is super knowledgeable in his field. He clearly loves pollinators and will make you love them too by the end of the class. 

Definitely recommend.

",311
hawthorne,4,B,BSCI126,"Prof. Hawthorne is very knowledgeable and down to earth. He treats you with respect and kindness and values your opinion. He tends to try to make an otherwise boring class interesting and uses powerpoints, TED talk videos, and hand on teaching to make sure you know everything you need to before the final project at the end of the semester. 

About the project specifically, it's a group project involving the people you've worked with all semester in your discussion sections. Basically you just design a hypothetical project to bring pollinators into an urban area and discuss how you would do it and what you would need. He gives you free reign to do whatever you think is best and generally just let's you run with it.

The ONLY downfall I find with this class are the (simple) 5 - 10 point quizzes he gives on the reading from the night before. He calls them BCRs and it reminds me of highschool and kind of annoys me. They're not hard if you read the chapter thoroughly, but they are sometimes on obscure parts of the book. He does let you use your book during them though, so BRING YOUR BOOKS to class.

The exams overall were easier than the quizzes, even though they did ask you to label a diagram in a few of them. For example, labeling the diagram of a flower. You go over it beforehand in discussion though, so just pay attention and you'll do fine.

Otherwise, great professor. I'm a bit sad I'm graduating as he's pretty knowledgeable and chill. Take him if you need a fairly fun class for credit.",311

hawthorne,5,B+,BSCI120,Incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic professor. Very receptive to student concerns and a great guy!,311
hawthorne,5,A,BSCI126,Dr. Hawthorne is a really nice teacher and he cares about his students. Exams are a little demanding because they covered a lot of readings but grading is ok. Overall will take him again.,311
hawthorne,5,A,BSCI126,"BSCI 126 is a class that is interesting and not too hard at the same time. The exams can be difficult but Dr. Hawthorne cares about his students and tries his best to help them do well in the class. In addition, Dr. Hawthorne is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and you can tell that he is passionate about the material based on the energy he has in an 8 AM lecture. If you want to fulfill the DSNS gen-ed requirement, BSCI 126 with Dr. Hawthorne is a good choice to do so.",311
mosser,4,B,BSCI422,"I had him with Frauwirth. He's also a great lecturer. Very engaging. The material was really interesting too and he helped me get excited about immunology. Tests were hard, but reasonable. Would definitely recommend.",312
mount_stephen,3,A,BSCI410,"I took it as a blended learning class, and it turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. There is A LOT of online material, and the in-class lectures once a week were not very helpful. Dr. Mount does not really go into the stuff that he expects us to know for the exams. I did bad on the first two exams, but still ended up with a good grade because I did well on the last exam and the final. The good thing is that he normalizes all the exams to a mean of 80 and drops the worst exam. From personal experience, Mount is understanding and nice, but he is not a very effective at explaining the material. Or maybe, this class is not suitable for blended learning since it is so technical.",313
mount_stephen,5,A,BSCI410,"Prof. Mount himself is not the world's most engaging lecturer. I had the blended learning version so I just had class one day a week and was given video lectures to watch for the other day. You can watch the lectures whenever (or never, though it's a good idea to look them over before exams).

Weekly quizzes that I'd often forget to do until the day after the due date. Oops. Oh well, they're not too difficult anyway. You get a bunch of attempts so you can just brute force your way to a good grade on them.

The material varies from interesting genetic lab techniques to Mendelian genetics on steroids. The latter is far less interesting and often surprisingly complex. The textbook is extremely helpful here. Advanced Genetic Analysis by Meneely is a lifesaver. The Hartwell Genetics book had its moments but I used far less frequently.

Lowest of 3 exams is dropped. Each exam is curved pretty generously as well. 

Not a hard course, but be prepared to study a bit. Look over his old exams he posts on his website because reused questions are common. Fill out the study guides he posts on a Google doc (or print one off that's been completed and learn from that) and you'll probably be okay.",313
mount_stephen,2,,BSCI410,"If he teaches this as a blended learning class again, don't take it. He's not terribly difficult, but he doesn't teach at all! Lectures are rather useless, and the online lectures are poorly constructed (pauses, ums, even audible yawns). I learned more from my peers in the days before exams than from him in any format of lecture. Study guides frequently had questions that covered material that wasn't addressed in quizzes or lectures! He didn't proofread one of our exams and ended up having to add 16 points onto everyone's exam grade before curving them because the questions were impossible to answer with the given information. I don't really feel as if I learned anything new in this class that I didn't know from 222 already, just glancing information about some new genetic analysis techniques.

There are a few positives: he normalizes everything to an 80%, 88% is the A-/B+ line, and he'll either drop your lowest midterm or make the exam only 20% of your final grade (as opposed to 80%). And then he normalizes again at the end of the class so you get the highest grade out of those normalizations (or so he claims).

Overall, not impressed. If you actually want to learn, I hear the other professors are pretty good.",313
mount_stephen,3,B,BSCI410,"do not take this class with mount. i heard this class is much better in the fall with the other 2 professors
mount is a horrible professor but getting a good grade in the class isn't too hard if you do above average and he curves a lot depending on class averages",313
mount_stephen,3,A+,BSCI410,"not a terribly difficult class with the way he curves twice over (once for each assignment, and then overall at the end of the semester). i would say i went to class 1/3 to 1/4 of the time. and when i did go, it was really boring so i never paid any real attention. 

his homeworks took a long time to do. he covers a LOT of material during each lecture so you can expect to look at 80-90 slides per lecture. i did cuss myself out for not going to class right before each exam - a lot of the reason being that his lecture slides are so unorganized and made me want to kill myself. 

if you dont want to go to class...get the book, read the background on the topics, and skim the slides. you may need to know tiny details that are on the slides for his exams - it's very annoying. a lot of the stuff is pulled from the book though, so if you go through that you'll understand the context of almost everything.

exams were reasonable. as the other person said..he did totally change the format of the final on us. it had a lot of open ended which he almost never had before. i felt terrible taking the exam but i guess i did ok in the end - they may have been extra lenient on it because i still got an A on it without a curve somehow?",313
mount_stephen,1,A-,BSCI410,"Fell alseep in his class whenever he lectured. He just didn't make the material very clear and went through the material way too fast. The homeworks are doable but takes a lot of time if you don't follow what he is saying in class.
his lecturing style is very boring making it hard to pay attention to. and even when i tried i couldn't understand the concepts very well. he teaches with facts instead of trying to help you understand the mechanisms... and his final was very unfair. changed the entired format compared with the previous exams...",313
mount_stephen,3,A,BSCI410,"Dr. Mount really knows his molecular genetics. The course consists of very up-to-date information, and was fascinating to learn. Grading is very fair and it's possible for lots of people to get A's. 

However, lectures can consist of over a 100 slides, which makes taking in the information like drinking from a fire hose. He also expects a strong background from BSCI222. Old tests are posted online, but he stresses not to go strictly by them. I suggest going to lecture, reading the book (though it is a lot), and going over the past exams. If you don't understand something on the old exams, make sure you study that concept as well as any related concept, since it's usually a slight variation from previous years that end up appearing on the exam. ",313
mount_stephen,3,A,BSCI410,"The content of the course was disorganized in my opinion. It was really hard to group the second half of the course in a category. He does not follow the order of the chapters in the book.

Mount as a teacher goes real fast in sometimes will not explain things clearly. Eventually the material gets so complicated you just tune out. 

Pros: He normalize all averages to 80% so one time i actually got a 70 and the average was a 66 and my grade ended up being an 84.8. An A ended up being around 83 so just be a little higher than the average. Drops the lowest exam and hw

Cons: His homeworks are extremely hard. You always need to send him emails and go to his office hours just to get slightly closer to solving them. He says they are two notches higher than the hw you get from BSCI222 but its impossible. luckily he curves this impossible to 80% also.",313
mount_stephen,2,,BSCI410,"Not a bad teacher, strong, relevant, up to date genetics information, but he should make tapes for insomniacs - his voice will put you to sleep immediately if you forget your morning coffee. 
He gives you access to slides and internet information before lectures, has a crazy curve and does pretty good study guides before exams. He also posts old exams, which are very similar to current ones.  ",313
mount_stephen,2,A,BSCI410,"Stephen Mount is a mediocre *at-best* professor. While clearly brilliant with regards to his knowledge of genetics and biology as a whole, his poor public speaking/course design abilities severely damage his ability to teach. Content is disorganized; there is not clear architecture to what students are expected to learn and lectures take frequent roundabout tangents that are seemingly unrelated to course material. Ambiguous about grading --> literally does not communicate how he will assign grades. Gave a vague comment about how he matches exam grades to fit a certain standard deviation, but said he assigns letter grades based off how he ""feels the class did as a whole"". Doesn't have office hours and frequently ignores raised hands. Overall, the class is not too difficult, but teaching seems to be far outside of the abilities Stephen Mount has been given as a scientist.",313
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Straney. He's one of the nicest most caring professors I've ever had. His material is so organized, all the questions he asks are very structured and well designed to be easy to learn, but still demonstrate the material in a memorable way. I've had a lot of bio classes where the material is just disorganized, hard to learn, and easy to forget. Dr. Straney's class is exactly the opposite.


He holds extra review sessions and he brings tea and cookies!! Where else are you going to find that. He even brought food to the early morning final. He posts all his past exams, his expectations are reasonable, he offers extra credit that's actually a lot of fun (RNA puzzle game). Genetics is HARD but he makes it fun and interesting. 

I had a summer internship immediately after taking the class where I used exactly what he taught us, it was incredibly helpful. He's my advisor now too and he's just such a great guy, remembers my name and things about me and clearly cares a lot about his students and the subject of genetics. Genuinely could not recommend him more. ",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"Reviews below pretty much sums everything up. Dr. Straney is extremely nice and is a great professor. He tries his best to teach his students by putting up his lectures on Canvas and by having multiple review sessions and office hours. Unfortunately, he got rid of the ""drop the lowest exam grade"" policy this semester, which is unfortunate (since the average for the first exam was extremely low), but it is fine. There was an extra credit opportunity later one that boosted our grades back up. Just a warning. The first exam was by far the hardest exam. It is very long and the entire class had trouble finishing it on time. The average for our first exam in my discussion was a 50%, so make sure you do well on the first exam. If you do well on the first one, then you are pretty much set; the next two exams were much easier. I got a B on the first one, an A+ on the second one, a B+ on the third one and an A- on the final, and got an A in the course. Overall, he is a great professor and I highly recommend taking him.",314
straney,5,B,BSCI222,"Very good class, and what a helpful professor. It's a lot of information, but you will definitely feel like you learned something afterwards.He gives out old exams, answers all quesyions, RECORDS HIS LECTURES, gives out outlines that cut your reading in half.... You name it and he does it. BEWARE of the first exam. You don't have as much time as you think!
BTW, Dr. Straney brought us tea and cookies for our review sessions. TEA AND COOKIES!!",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"Based off these reviews, I registered for Straney thinking that I would wanna like marry him by the end of it cuz I would love him so much or something. (v impt life update: decidedly do not want to marry him)

Basically the reason why Straney is so highly rated isn't because you're gonna remember him being like ""Wow he was that memorable amazing teacher I had in college,"" it's because he basically hands you everything you will ever need on a platter and then says ""here comes the choo choo train"" and spoon-feeds it into your mouth.

He gives you all the material you could ever need:
- Uploaded powerpoint slides for each lecture
- Study guides for each lecture that tells you what you should know
- Outlines for each lecture (he basically already took your notes for you)
- Practice exams with answer keys for exams 1, 2, 3, and the final (6 per test, so a total of 24 practice exams for the entire course)
- Review sessions (where he tells you exactly what's going to be on the exam)
- Lets you take exams for as long as you need (!!!) Seriously this man will stay with you until you are done that exam, even if it takes you 5 hours. AND he lets you start exams late if you want to do last minute cramming.

There are some classes where you're like ""easy class but the teacher sucks"" but this isn't one of them. He is the nicest, most down-to-earth, most approachable teacher on campus. It's so obvious he WANTS to help and wants every student to succeed. You can ask him any question ever and he gives you straight-up answers (and gives you answers for pre-labs if you wanted to double-check your work or are just too lazy to do it). He never treats you like you're stupid.

HE BROUGHT COOKIES EVERY FRIDAY AND EXAM DAY. WHO DOES THAT SERIOUSLY like it's like he's the father of everyone in the class, and everyone is his favorite child that he spoils, it was awesome. Okay and they weren't even like lame cookies, like the day before our final he brought s'more cookies. I didn't even know s'more cookies existed but now I do and omg they were so good.

The #1 thing to do with Straney is do the old practice exams. Straney reuses the same questions over and over so old practice exams show you exactly the answer he's looking for.

There's no curve but half the class got an A (average final grade was a 90) so you shouldn't need it. The only way you could possibly do badly with Straney is if you literally never paid attention and/or didn't do practice exams the night before an exam. Do NOT take Genetics with anyone else or you will be making a huge mistake.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI415,"Dr. Straney is the best professor ever. I cannot say it enough. He really wants his students to do well and is so incredibly patient. This course is composed of 4 lab reports, 6 homework assignments, one midterm quiz, and a final quiz. You do interesting experiments throughout the semester. There are four main experiments you carry through over the course of the semester. It is very interesting to actually apply what you learn in textbooks and lectures. I loved this course. Dr. Straney does not have ""deadlines"" but ""target dates"". He's so understanding. Please don't take advantage of it. He puts in so much time for us and is patient enough to answer all of your questions...even if another student already asked. He genuinely wants you to do well and I believe this is how teaching should be. I definitely learned so much out of this course, especially when putting those lab reports together. If you can take this class, please do.

To be honest, his lectures are a bit boring at times but if you feel like you are not being able to put your full attention in class, it is not at all intimidating to go up to him and ask questions after class or during his office hours. It is very feasible to do well in this class if you keep up with the assignments (that's probably one of the biggest challenges for this class), go to Straney's reviews before exams, and review past exam papers.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"He's a fantastic instructor, the tests are relatively easy to manage and you shouldn't have any issue getting at the least a B+ in his course.

straney,5,A,BSCI222,"Dr Straney is the sweetest professor on campus. He is a semi-boring lecturer but a good one at that. He always provides past exams with smiliar problems he will put on his exam so make sure you do them. Most of the material is straight memorization, but of course you have to understand the processes. Discussion is really boring but it's good easy points to get. Make sure you do the end of the chapter textbook problems - they help you understand the material even better. Keep up with the material since you will learn a lot.
Dr Straney is ALWAYS there for help so make use of him and your TAs!",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"DR. STRANEY IS AMAZING!!!! He is the nicest professor you will ever have and he legitimately cares about each student succeeding.

He gives you an infinite amount of material so that you can succeed (study guides, lectures, outlines, old exams and weekly review sessions). He also is just an extremely caring person, he brings cookies to class sometimes, and for the final we just took, he brought a lot of food and coffee and tea for everyone. He just goes out of his way to make your life easier and does everything he can to make the class and material interesting. 

This class in general is a lot of work, especially the discussion. In order to succeed just make sure you get all the easy points in discussion and review Dr. Straney's old exams. If you know his lecture slides and the old exams really well then the exams should be easy for you since he tests on a lot of the same concepts. If you have extra time going over his study guides and outlines is helpful as well.
All together, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE GENETICS WITH DR. STRANEY BECAUSE YOU WON'T REGRET IT AND YOU WILL LEARN A LOT!!",314

Exams were pretty fair and weren't too bad if you kept up with the material. He's one of those professors who wants everyone to do well so he posts study guides on bb and holds review sessions for the exams. Pretty much gives you ample opportunity to do well.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"This class was the easiest I've taken so far. I skipped lecture, went to discussion, and read the book. Dr. Straney provides tons of resources including lecture powerpoints, lecture outlines, and old exams. If you have a basic understanding of genetics, you shouldn't have to put too much work into this class. Exams were fair, and you can drop one, which is quite helpful. However, there is no final curve for the class. Regardless, I honestly think they tried to make this class as easy as possible.",314
straney,4,B-,BSCI222,"Extremely nice and helpful, gives you plenty of resources to study from. lectures tend to be boring but he's very passionate about what he teaches. holds weekly q&a sessions. i read reviews saying this course used to be easy with him. it's not anymore. i think they leaned on him to give less A's, so don't expect an easy ride",314

He makes class interesting even when some of the material can be dull at times. He's also very willing to help you with anything outside of class. Make sure to do well in discussion (especially on the weekly quizzes) because it will help your grade in the end. Study well for the weekly quizzes in discussion...they are detailed and difficult. Otherwise, the other things you do in discussion are easy points. Your two lowest quiz and homework scores will be dropped. There are 3 exams (the lowest score is dropped).

Take it with Straney if you can. ",314
straney,5,A,BSCI415,"Before I start, let me assert that Dr. Straney is one of the best professors at Maryland!! Anyone that says otherwise must have some sort of grudge against him...

I started out taking BSCI 207 and most of the classes I had taken since then were mostly rehashed versions of previous material - I started to find that the classes became very boring. I never really paid attention in my classes after a while and would just cram for exams and do just fine. That's all fine and good - I was getting through everything that I needed to get though - but I totally stopped enjoying biology.

The environment that Dr. Straney created in the lab gave me faith in biology again. It wasn't just about memorizing things, doing busywork, and worrying how others do (e.g. curves in organic labs). He cares so much about having students learn the material - and he is able to teach very effectively. If you have any questions at all, you can call, email, or see him before/after class and he is always willing to help. He also understands that sometimes people's semesters are loaded and it may be difficult to get everything done on time and be satisfied with it - he will let you turn things in by what he calls an ""approximate date."" His quizzes and exams are very, very reasonable - read the rationale for doing the labs and why we do things the way we do before the semester quizzes and make sure to understand your lab reports before the final exam - and everything will go smoothly. He is a big proponent of ""big ideas"" over minute-you-will-never-need-it-again details. He tests understanding of material.

I really, really enjoyed the class and put in (and enjoyed putting in) some effort. I learned a lot and appreciated being able to do so in a fairly relaxed environment.

If you're in a class with him right now, don't take him for granted. You should really appreciate what he brings to the classroom.",314
straney,4,A,BSCI222,"I personally don't see what is so great about Straney. The way he teaches is pretty boring. However, he is very nice and holds a weekly review session and stays however long you need him to. 
Overall the class is pretty easy. The resources he provides you with are soooo useful for the exams. From what I know, there was no curve, but I'm not sure. 
Discussion helps a lot with your grade because it's like busy work and fairly simple. However, there's a weekly quiz which you should review your notes for. You can get away with not going to class and reading the powerpoint.
The biggest thing to study is the study guides and lecture outlines. With those, you should be fine. 
Take Straney if you can, he makes the class pretty easy.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"This man is a saint! The nicest and sweetest man on earth - period. He tries incredibly hard to help students understand the rather difficult material by posting lecture outlines, study guides, old exams, holding weekly review sessions, and always having his door open to any one who needs help. If you need BSCI222 (or want to take it), take it with Dr. Straney!!! You won't regret it!

Exams: they're rather detailed and require you to thoroughly know the information from lecture. Textbook helps a lot, but doesn't determine what will be on the exam. He likes promoters, regulatory elements (that's essentially his research), and math-based problems. When studying ALWAYS reference the study guides and ALWAYS go to review. ALWAYS. 

Discussion: he has no say about what goes on there, since that's Dr. Shields' domain. It does help your grade a lot. 

Final: covers half comprehensive and half new material. Comprehensive sections covers only what's been tested on previous exams. This time he had a tricky problem, but it doesn't usually happen on the midterms. 

Overall: very fair class where you learn a whole bunch. Highly recommended!!    ",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,Dr. Straney is literally the nicest person to have EVER stepped on college park. He actually wants students to learn and do well. He holds review sessions every week and brought cookies/hot cocoa at least once when I went! He makes his tests very fair and just generally likes people. Don't you dare take BSCI222 with anyone else. ,314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"if you have the option of taking bsci222 for your major, TAKE IT  and TAKE IT WITH STRANEY!!
he is the nicest professor EVER and i definitely thought i was doing worse than i am. i can get an 85% on the final and still have an A in the class (i've gotten 89s on both tests and did kinda poorly on the quizzes in my opinion but the rest of discussion helps your grade SO MUCH!!) the second half of the class is kind of boring, but easy enough if you put normal effort into it. i think i might apply to TA the discussion of this class later on! :)",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"Dr. Straney is the best! He is probably one of the best professors at Maryland.  He is willing to explain absolutely anything, and is actually GLAD to be able to help.  Even in a huge lecture, he encourages everyone to ask questions and get help.  He even brought snacks to a review session before our exam.  Seriously a very approachable and genuinely nice guy.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI415,"This was a great course. I'm now in grad school, and this course taught me things that are really useful in my courses now. Dr. Straney is also the nicest person ever, and he really cares about students understanding and having enthusiasm about what they are learning. I definately recommend taking this course if you are thinking about going to Grad school for Cell/Molecular Biology!!!! ",314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,Great professor. Really cares about students doing well. Exams stem from lectures and text. Exams are fair and very doable. ,314
straney,5,A,BSCI415,"Dr. Straney is solid. Teachers don't get much better than him. He's excited, enthusiastic, willing to help, not afraid to slow down and explain something again, and just plain nice. 

This class is the epitome of what college classes should be like. There aren't a lot of students. The teacher is passionate. There's a lot of one on one interaction with the professor. Nearly everybody gets A's, but those are actually earned A's. This class is in no way a fluff class - there's a lot of work. But the work is doable and enjoyable. 

It's the complete opposite of the typical cookie-cutting lab class here at Maryland. Throughout the semester, we worked on four extended projects, which means we jumped around. You do a mutagenesis experiment (on both C. elegans and Arabidopsis), a molecular mapping experiment, a plant transformation experiment, and a DNA sequencing experiment. The DNA one was great - we isolated a highly variable region of our own CYP2D6 gene (it produces the protein that metabolizes nearly a third of the drugs we take) with PCR, sent it off to a lab, and analyzed the sequence results using different software programs. We found out if we had multiple copies, a defective copy, etc. and what that meant.

Seriously, if you have the chance to take this course, you won't be disappointed.",314
straney,5,A,BSCI415,"I cannot say enough about Dr. Straney. He is hands down the best professor in the science department and he makes this class one of the best. If you are remotely interested in genetics take this class! He makes it relatively easy and you actually do hands on things that work (compared to most science classes here at maryland). In addition, he is extremely nice and wants everyone to learn and succeed not just in his class but in life. He is very approachable and was always willing to help. The course had a lot of work on occasion, but it wasnt very difficult and he grades very easy. ",314
straney,3,C+,BSCI222,"really nice prf, but harsh grading policy. I did avg on all his exams, above avg on everything else, but bombed the final. My grade went down 6 points.      Reading the text book is a MUST because he doesn't go over everything in lecture.",314
straney,5,B+,BSCI222,LOVE STRANEY even though the class is a bit more brutal than necessary. he gives lots of materials. He's very friendly and caring and hilarious. ,314
straney,5,A,BSCI222,"An absolute gem of a professor. Kind, compassionate, encouraging, motivating, there aren't enough verbs to describe him. His lectures are interesting, and while some parts get dull (it is genetics, there is only so much you can do), he does his best to keep it fun and throws in the occasional joke here and there. He gives so much practice with his D2U, 222utorials, weekly review sessions, and practice exams, that you should have a surplus of review material. Memorize lecture slides, understand his exam questions, and ask him questions, and you literally can't do poorly unless you try. His final for online wasn't cumulative, but it is still fairly easy to do as long as you have been keeping up with the material. Information is also highly conceptual so make sure to apply the lectures. Good luck! ",314
manocha,1,A,ENEE351,"Do not take this class with professor Manocha. He does an even worse job than Kruskal for CMSC351 in terms of lecturing. He just reads off of slides and just expects you to be able to magically visualize extremely difficult topics on the fly. He even reads off complex time complexity derivations from the slides and expect you to understand. He mentions concepts in complete abstractions and whenever you ask him to show an example or draw the concept out to get a better understanding, he does not do it. For those who have a little bit of knowledge about learning algorithms, you will realize how important it is to draw things out when talking about graphs and recursion trees; he does none of it. You need to spend a lot of time outside of class to teach the material.

His homeworks are incredibly long and tedious, and students in class mentioned how they spent 20 hours on average on each homework. The math and proof that is involved in those problems is something that the prerequisite classes do not teach, and which he expects you to know. ",316
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"He's a really funny guy but I was definitely scared to ask questions in class because he made fun of like everyone who talked in class. His exams are fair and although he said there wasn't a curve at the beginning of class, there ended up being a small one because I had a 91.6 on ELMS but I still got an A",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Amazing professor. One of the best in the Mathematics Department. His exams are very straight forward and you WILL do well if you do all of the recommended problems. Make sure you get on your TA's good side. At the end of the semester, Dio sits with his TAs and goes through his roster and asks his TA what grade each student deserves. Dio really wants you to learn and if you ever have the opportunity to take him, TAKE HIM!",318
margetis,5,B,MATH241,"Dio is really a great teacher. He is passionate, and clearly loves to teach. His tests were graded a bit harshly, and one test with stupid mistakes was enough to drop me to a B. That being said, I think his expectations were fair and he did a good job of imparting the material. If you're the type of person who doesn't feel like going to every class, you could certainly get away with it. It wasn't very hard, and from what I've heard he's the best Calc 3 teacher you're going to find at UMD.",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Dio is an excellent lecturer. He is very engaging when he speaks and is never boring. He is also very easy to understand and writes clearly on the board. He is also hilarious, but usually at the expense of one of my classmates. The only reason I was hesitant to give him five stars is that he will destroy you in front of the whole class if you ask a question, no matter how legitimate it might be. Nonetheless I still enjoy his class and have learned quite a bit. The TAs are also excellent. I often learn as much in discussion as I do in lecture. The grades are fair. You do not have to turn in homework, but it is an excellent study tool. Also, the exams are not overly challenging. I would definitely recommend Margetis, just try not to provoke him.",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Great professor indeed.
But gotta say his exams were way too easy, including the final. 
Getting an A in this class is easy as long as you attend all the lectures, read the book, and do a lot of practice problems.
",318
margetis,5,B,MATH241,"This class should have been an A :(

Dr. Margetis is one of the prominent research professors in the Math department who happens to be a terrific lecturer. At times he may go a little too fast but his hand writing is pretty clear. 

The last 2 chapters are the difficult ones. Good Luck.",318
margetis,2,D,MATH241,"In talking with my friends, I regret that I didn't have Justin. Justin's exams were more straightforward compared to Dio's this semester. I could not rely on just his lecture material to prepare me for his exams. There were times that I didn't follow his notes, but I would never dare ask him to explain it in front of the class. Asking for any kind of help from him would be too intimidating. ",318

margetis,5,A,MATH463,"The reviews below do a good job of summing up Margetis. Phenomenal lecturer. Writes crystal clear, precise notes on the board, making reading the textbook unnecessary. There is a reason he is one of the highest rated professors on ourumd. His tests are really easy, and he drops the lowest grade. As mentioned below, however, he will absolutely destroy anybody asking questions. He can get away with it because he lectures so well, but it is nevertheless really embarrassing when you think you are asking a legitimate question and he rips you a new one. People very soon stop asking questions. In spite of this, I would recommend taking him over any other professor in the department. You will learn the material really well and get a good grade for it.",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,By far the best professor in the math department,318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"tests were extremely easy, maybe too easy.
the people who said that his tests were fair are being ridiculous. he pretty much told us which questions would be on the tests as he was teaching the material, and during the lecture before the test he would give many hints. 

the best part of class was when he would completely rip apart the people in the first few rows when they would ask ridiculously dumb questions. margetis can be quite funny in these outbursts, but if you are the target you might be embarrassed in front of ~200 other people.

Overall he is an excellent 'teacher', from what i have heard a brilliant mathematician/physicist, and quite the entertainer.

Although he may rip you apart for a dumb question, if you ask a bright question or make an insightful point during lecture he will praise you and ask you your name in front of ~200 people.
and those are definitely rewarding moments.
basically, choose your questions and comments wisely during lecture.

Final was hard, though. avg. in my section was a 120/200. 
",318
margetis,5,,MATH241,"Great professor; will burn you in class if you ask stupid questions. Engaging and fair tests (sometimes).

If you have a good TA, then you are in for a easy math semester, if not, you probably have to do extra work out of class :T

But overall, Calc III was fun with Margetis! :D",318
margetis,4,A,MATH241,"Good choice for Calc 3

Dio is excellent at teaching the material and lecturing. I was able to follow his lectures and not have to read the book for almost the entire course which is very uncommon for me. His grading and tests are very fair and his website is organized. The only problem I had with him is that asking questions in lectures usually resulted in a condescending or hostile answer and sometimes he even ridiculed the student asking the question. I understand this is just his personality but it made me reluctant to raise my hand in lecture. ",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Overall great class. He's a good professor and very straightforward. His tests are fair and are based on problems gone over in lecture or in discussion. He doesn't collect any homeworks and doesn't give any quizzes in actual lecture so there is no incentive to go. Absolutely take Margetis, he's the best for calc 3.",318
margetis,4,B,MATH241,"He's a good professor.  He's very straightforward about the concepts, and has a great sense of humor.  However, he doesn't bring anything else to the table that you couldn't find elsewhere.  I stopped going to lecture pretty quickly.  The examples he gives are similar to the ones in the book, and although the explanations of the concepts in the book don't make much sense, you can find good ones online (I recommend Paul's Online calculus Notes).  He doesn't grade the homework, so there isn't much incentive to do it, but I would recommend doing it anyway since a lot of the tests problems are very similar, if not exactly the same as the ones he assigns for hw.",318
margetis,5,C+,MATH241,I went to about three lectures since 10am is a bit early for me. He is a very articulate speaker and knows how to explain the material well to even non-science/math majors like me. I'm horrible at math but still managed a C+ despite never getting above a 50% on my tests or quizzes. ,318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Overall, an excellent professor. He focuses on what you need to know for the course, with an occasional dose of humor. Takes 3/4 highest tests, 7/8 highest quizzes and 4 Matlabs (worth 7% of the overall grade). I also happened to have a terrific TA, so that definitely made the experience great. If you are going to take Calc III, I can't think of a better person to take it with.",318
margetis,5,B,MATH241,Absolutely wonderful Professor. Extremely articulate and teaches lessons beyond just Calculus. Was an enjoyable class to go to and never felt like I was wasting time by going to lecture. I don't see how a professor can get much better. ,318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"This class was exceptional. People taking the other professors classes (Rosenberg) were dealing with 60-70 test averages and our test averages were a cool uncurved 80. Dio made the material very easy to follow with no required homework. There are quizzes in discussion that are easy and matlab homework that's basically extra credit (and only 4 of them). He also drops a test and a quiz. 

Also his English is very articulate and easily understandable unlike other teachers you run into at UMD.

The tests were also much easier than the tests I saw from Rosenberg... The tests did test the material but they were not unreasonable so no real surprises. Sometimes you had to think but you weren't stretched too far. Also has his TAs give very reasonable partial credit.

Overall: Wonderful class.",318

margetis,5,A,MATH241,"He might seem a bit crazy at times, but to be honest it makes him a better professor. He will yell, but not at the students, it is for emphasis which is great in a morning class.

His homework is optional, he takes no attendance, and the quizzes aren't bad, either. Gives plenty of warning for upcoming exams and possible exam problems during lecture.

His exams and quizzes are very straight forward.  4 exams - drops lowest one, 6-8 quizzes, drops lowest one.  Some problems on exams and quizzes came directly from problems he showed in lecture.  He will tell you during lecture which problems he thinks are ""hot"" for an upcoming exam.  He's also a really funny guy and cracks jokes quite often, but not enough to seem unprofessional.  I highly recommend Dr. Margetis for 241.",318
margetis,5,A,MATH241,"Great professor.  Wants you to understand the material.  Teaches straight from the book, but helps you understand it a little better.  I cruised by the class. Consists of 7 quizzes (you can drop 2 of them) and 4 tests (you can drop 1).  NO HOMEWORKS, DOES NOT TAKE ATTENDANCE, AND ANNOUNCES THE DAYS OF EVERY QUIZ AND EXAM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  Exam and quiz questions are just examples he gives in class with different numbers.  If you are good at understanding math you dont even have to show up to class and can teach yourself with the book like I did.  If you make a stupid mistake on something but otherwise set a problem up right he will only deduct a few points.  Definately try to get Margetis if he is teaching your class. ",318

Every lecture session reinforces the previous session, so you won't be clueless. The guy tries very hard to make sure you knows the topics. As a person, he's a funny and caring guy. He throws jokes quite often and so there's not always a tense studying environment. He's easily approachable and will help if asked. His tests and grading policy in my opinion are a little too easy, not that its a bad thing, but he does teach well and you will come out knowing the material of the course IF you try. Take him if you can. I highly recommend him. ",318

margetis,4,A+,MATH241,"I just wanted to preface this by saying that I did indeed get an A in Dio's class, and a pretty decent grade on the final (188/200). Not trying to brag, but I'm just showing that he's a pretty solid teacher. 

Dio is a good lecturer if you like his teaching style. He goes very fast and draws a ton of diagrams, but doesn't really slow down for people who like to ask questions or perhaps take time to understand things. If you went to lecture and did hw problems as soon as the lecture was over (or, at least before the next class), you'll be more than fine. He stresses that you should do the problems. You should - they're vital to your understanding of more complicated topics like Stokes or Greens theorems (to name a few). 

I failed the first test - 21/40. Luckily, he drops your lowest exam, and also your lowest quiz grade. I think he just made the first test intentionally tough to weed out the kids who weren't serious. That being said, the next three tests were a joke with regards to difficulty, and I got straight 40/40's on all three, making my test average a 100. Legit, doing the problems, as well as looking at his pasts tests on koofers, gets you through his tests. 

The final wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad either. That being said, Justin's average was a cool 6 points higher than Dio's, making me believe that perhaps Dio's teaching style didn't really suit everyone. I stopped showing up to lecture because once you miss one, he moves way too fast to keep up with - I just watched professor leonard on youtube. 

With regards to TA's... well taht's a toss up to be honest. You may get lucky with a good one, or unlucky with a bad one. Either way, the material is easy to self study if you find yourself behind for a quiz, and there are plenty of resources online necessary to do so. 

Finally, they do bump letter grades if you were a good student and did well on tests/quizzes (for those who don't do super well on the final). For instance, one of my friends got bumped from a B+ to an A- for his final grade. I also have friends who had 91.0 and up who all got bumped to A's. Just keep a nice relationshpi with your TA and you should be fine. 

All in all, Dio was good. Grades weren't super hard to get and he's a good teacher. But if you can, take Justin. Seriously, that guy's a legend.",318
margetis,2,B,AMSC466,"arrogant, doesn't explain well",318
margetis,5,B,AMSC466,"I thought Margetis is pretty good. His (online, synchronous, not recorded) lectures were very organized and he writes neatly using an tablet. He can be mean sometimes so the class wasn't exactly responsive when he asked questions (at least I was intimidated), and those silent moments were awkward. The assignments consisted of ~10 problem sets, 3 midterms plus the final. Homework was reasonable, basically asking to replicate things he did in lectures. Tests were timed, with the midterms basically homework-looking questions and the final slightly more involved than the homework. I found the exams extremely stressful, mostly because of the time pressure, and for that I screwed up a lot of computations. Otherwise the exam problems were fun.
The course forced me to relearn calculus, which was good. I don't like my grade :/ But still this is one of my favorite classes taken. I have no complaints...",318
margetis,4,A,AMSC466,"The last review is spot on. He's sort of intimidating and gets noisy when asked questions, but overall his lectures are extremely organized. Exams were mostly computational which can be annoying if you screw up. He gives more time than if it were in person, but I felt like you have to use the entire time if you want to make sure you answered everything the way he wanted you to. I also think his offering of 466 is probably on the easier side, because I don't think I learned very much. Interpolation is heavily emphasized, while nothing about linear systems is covered. He also really wants people to turn on their cameras which made me a little uncomfortable. People sort of stopped caring after a few weeks though.",318
margetis,2,A-,AMSC466,"Mark my words, this class is death, and Dio is the poison. The material is extremely dry, which is not the professor's fault. I did feel as if Dio was a somewhat dry lecturer, and at times our class fell down the rabbit hole and we were so far off-topic I couldn't understand which way was up or down. While the online-exams were not extremely difficult, the algebra was brutal. He would require us to solve huge algebraic equations, just to get to the next problem which would have us do the exact same thing but even more so (aka orthogonal polynomials). This class was awful, I do not recommend, do yourselves a favor and take AMSC460 instead. For the record, I perform very well in all math classes and this was my first non-A. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",318
margetis,3,A,AMSC466,"Not going to lie, the course sucks. It is not interesting. But if you take my warning you should be warned that AMSC460 is not much better if at all, at least according to my pals.

Dio himself as a lecturer is very polarizing; I found I didn't like him at first, along with the content, but eventually I found that he was not too bad. He is very witty and quick on the nose. He tends to be very thorough, although because of the material this meant that class time was a little snoozy.
If he was teaching a course that was more interesting I would take him again.
The homework was not too bad and neither were the exams. However he chose not to have a final but instead a doubly weighted homework (probably to spare himself the trouble of grading a final), but this is a pro for most students (including me). Feel bad for the grader though.",318

dolgopyat,3,A+,STAT400,"The professor was okay for Stat400. He seemed very nice and wanted to help. However, his lecturng was not good and only a very small amount of people attended. He puts sample responses on Elms before the midterms and final which are very helpful. He also has homework solutions which help teach you the material and prepare you for the weekly quizzes, a generous 40 percent of your grade.",319
dolgopyat,1,A,STAT400,"He is impossible to understand. He speaks very quietly, has a thick accent, and is overall a poor lecturer. Lecture is awful, and the majority of the learning in this class is done on your own or in discussion. I had an excellent TA which made discussion tolerable, but I've heard from friends in other sections that several of his TA's are not good.

Grading-wise, this class isn't difficult. Weekly quizzes are usually taken directly from homework problems, and the exams were basically mirror images of the practice exams we were given.",319
dolgopyat,2,A,,"You should take this class with anyone else. Seriously. Dolgopyat is the worst lecturer I have had to date in any class. He makes this class far more confusing than it has to be in lecture; the material itself isn't difficult. It's just probabilities, means, and standard deviations, but Dmitri will give you overly complicated formulas and actively confuse you. That's not to mention that he lectures through a thick accent and monotone mumbling, so he is very hard to understand or pay attention to. We're halfway into the semester, and only 30 kids show up to the 200 person lecture anyone because the lecture is almost useless. If you have this class with him, you are better off teaching the material to yourself or with friends on your own time than going to lecture.",319
dolgopyat,1,,,"The review below does a good job of highlighting the fact that he does not speak clearly at all. His accent and his tendency to speak very softly makes it extremely hard to understand anything he's saying. This translates into being a very poor professor overall, and he tends to go over the problems, so fast that going to the lectures accomplishes literally nothing. Most of the class ends up just studying the entire course out of the book since he does not help at all. The weekly quizzes are 40% of your overall grade, which means if you have a bad TA who does not speak english then you are screwed. I would say that Prof. Dolgopyat is not a good professor for this course, and he does not curve since he does not care about his students one bit. Try to take this course with someone else besides him; this class will be much easier with anyone else. ",319
dolgopyat,4,A,STAT410,"Though Prof. Dolgopyat is not the best lecturer (he tends to speak very fast or very low) he does make up for it by providing a wide array of problems, and goes over each one thoroughly. Most people in the class earned an A with a couple almost failing because they were a little too cocky (ppl who scored A's on exams) and decided not to do the HW (worth 25% of grade). He did give them a pass but I don't know if he will do that in the future. All in all three exams and HW is not much to stress a person out but be warned, if you can't follow what the prof is writing on the board without listening to them explain it then you will not fair well in his class. As I've said before he doesn't speak clearly.",319
dolgopyat,1,B-,STAT410,"His lectures are useless. You'll basically be learning the material entirely on your own. Also, the average on our final was a 56% and he STILL didn't curve. I urge anyone to take STAT410 with someone else or STAT400.",319

perlis,4,A,CMSC421,"Perlis has a straight forward lecture style (notes available on course website). Unfortunately, his pace is extremely slow. What could be completed in 30min will take him an hour. This is partly because he is careful to explain all details, which does help with understanding. 
The homeworks are easy and very helpful for reviewing the material. We've only had one project so far (3/5 through the semester) and it took roughly 1 hour. Quizzes every week based solely on lecture material. Pretty easy if you pay attention in class.
PLEASE NOTE: this is an INTRO class to AI. Most of the semester is spent building the fundamentals and not actually exploring AI techniques. It starts with blind searches, smart searches, propositional and first-order logic. These are not difficult topics, but they take up HALF the course.",320
perlis,4,A,CMSC250,"Honestly, going to class is optional and so is reading the book. However, I hear the book is excellent in clearing up most of the topics covered. Also, find someone that has taken the class before because at some point they find out the textbook is available online...
His exams are based on the homeworks and almost identical to the practice exams he puts online.
I can't comment much on his teaching style because I never paid attention in class. But he posts notes up online if you need, I never used them. I never studied for this class. Understand the homeworks and you'll do well. I loved Perlis because the way he grades helps out everyone and does it in such a way that is beneficial for everyone. He has no need to curve but he might. I definitely recommend him. I will say that some of his classes are extremely boring and I learned nothing from them.   ",320
perlis,5,A,CMSC250,"Easy class. Weekly quizzes and homeworks given, but mostly re-iterate simple topics. Grading in the class is set up to help immensely.

Honestly, the material is not too difficult, so there isn't really much to say. Perlis' lectures are okay, but attending them is not actually necessary to understand the topics.",320
perlis,4,A,CMSC250,"Perlis is a great professor to take CMSC250 with. Coming into this semester, I read ourumd.com's reviews and I was pessimistic about this course because of the low reviews and comparatively low GPA that Perlis had, but after taking this class I can assure you that Perlis is fair, if not even easy to take.

His tests are fairly easy with a major recurring focus on induction, and his homeworks are pretty fair as long as you pay attention to details. The quizzes are extremely easy and are just attendance points. The curve is significant and he dropped the lowest 2 homeworks and 2 quizzes. Combined with the curve, this allows you to pretty much have an 85% and get an A. I'd definitely take 351 or whatever other classes he teaches in the future, because I enjoyed this class, learning about new mathematical concepts, and getting the A at the end.",320
perlis,4,A,CMSC250,"Perlis is a pretty good professor. He is extremely fair on every assignment, quiz, and exam in terms of what he asks and how he has the TA's grade it. He tries very hard to make the material interesting with his own little twists in how he presents the topics.

However, the topics were fairly easy in general, especially if you come from a strong math background, so class can seem like a waste of time. Also, he mostly just presents stuff from the book, so you technically don't really need to go to class at all if you can just learn it from the book.

Though this class, while being easy, will introduce you to some very interesting areas of math which I'm assuming will be covered in more detail in later classes. 

Overall, you've got a few very interesting topics, a pretty good professor who is at least very fair in grading, and not much hw (just one short assignment due each week), making this a decent class to take.",320
perlis,5,A,CMSC250,"Coming from MATH, I can say 250 is an unique course.  It takes elements from different math categories that you have either seen (As a math major) or will see (as a CS major).  Some overlaps include elementary number theory (seen it if you took MATH406), counting (seen it if you took STAT400), and logical equivalences (CE majors probably have already seen truth tables and logical curcuits.  Although, I was very familiar this class is not a walk in the park.  Hence the overall GPA of the course.

If you want to get a 4-credit A or B, take this class with no one other than Perlis.  He has two methods:
Method one:  15% quizzes, 15% homework, 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 30% final
Method two:  15% quizzes, 15% homework, 30% best of two midterms, 40% final

Your grade is determined based on the highest of the two methods and the curve.  This class with Perlis is really convenient, especially if you are taking 212 or 313.  I suggest taking this with Perlis if you are taking them, or take 250 and 212 or 313 separately.",320
perlis,1,B,CMSC250,"This professor consistently confuses himself to the point where he wants to bang his own head on the wall and waste 25 minutes of our 80 minutes lecture time.
His examples in class are completely irrelevant to the stuff on the quizzes and the final.

The homeworks are challenging but if you memorize the examples solved in the book you will do fine.

Final verdict: Because Perlis is incompetent at understanding the material himself, he is not the best professor to take this course with. It's like paying good tuition for someone who doesn't even know what he's talking about. Pick another professor.",320
perlis,3,A,CMSC250,"Perlis is an interesting guy, very frail. His lectures aren't difficult to follow, and his tests are ridiculously easy. I went to about 50% of lectures up until the first exam and got a 100 on it. I then did not attend one lecture for the rest of the semester, and still got a B+ on the final (left a lot blank, and did not review or study at all) and an A in the course. Sometimes he seems to get a little confused in class, but always answers any questions via email (which gets really annoying after a while, since he replies to the whole class).

My recommendation is to attend all of the discussion sections, as this is where you will see what you really need to know.",320
perlis,4,A,CMSC250,"Personally, I agree with some of the earlier complaints about Perlis confusing himself on some of his examples and problems, but he always corrects himself when he figures it out, by email if he can't in person.  He also sends answers to any homework questions students ask him to the entire class listserv, which can be very helpful in figuring out the problems.  The homeworks are hard, but considering that you have a week to do them and can ask questions about the assignments to the TAs (I personally had Peter Fontana, who I have to say made everything SO much easier) or Perlis in class or via email, they're not so bad.  Quizzes are also hard, sometimes extremely so, but to compensate, he drops two of them at the end of the semester.  He also drops two homeworks.

As for exams, as long as you have a reasonable understanding of the material, they're quite easy.  None of them are terribly long; a few large questions, a few short answers, a couple fill-in-the-blanks, and you're done.  To make things even better, if you screw up terribly on one of the midterms, it gets dropped (though the other midterm and the final are made to count for more to compensate).

All told, I found Perlis to be a very fair and nice teacher, which is a lot more than I can say for some others.",320
perlis,3,C,CMSC250,"Dr. Perlis would post huge reviews online that were normally problems taken right out of the book and then changed a tiny bit... with a couple tricks.

The range of grades in the class is very large. As any math major that is in the class will maintain an easy A, while pure CS students will struggle.

The curve for our class was as follows:
For each student grades were calculated as follows:
Method 1: HWK 15%; QUIZZES 15%; TWO MIDTERMS 20% each; FINAL 30% 
Method 2: HWK 15%; QUIZZES 15%; MIDTERM (best of two) 30%; FINAL 40%

perlis,1,,CMSC250,"THE worst professor ive ever had. unorganized during class, VERY sloppy notes, quizzes are often not relevant to anything gone over in class. his explanations are terrible because he gets confused with his own problems a lot. halfway through a problem he will realize he made a mistake and go back through the entire problem. homeworks are mostly hard. in my opinion he might know what hes doing, hes just terrible at explaining it. also, he'll spend an entire lecture on the same topic doing the same 2 or 3 problems. a lot of the class is based on learning things from the book or online.

Literally, he would give us a practice problem over the listserv and then be unable to solve it the next day. He was disorganized and invariably gave an inaccurate description of his exam material.

The average on that exam was... distressing. ",320

Simple quizzes on Mondays to refresh on the material, two midterms were pretty standard (mix of short answer and multiple choice). We had 5 HW and 3 projects, all of which took me about average time to finish. I heard from classmates that they had trouble getting extra help in office hours, but I never had a problem.

perlis,5,A,CMSC250,"Prof. Perlis was a great choice for CMSC250! Take his section if you can.

The good:
Lecture notes and discussion practice are thorough and updated frequently on ELMS - textbook not even required!
Exams were fair in both difficulty and length, with averages around the department norm of 80. 
Of the homeworks (~2 per week), one easy (""A"") and one hard (""B"") version are dropped, and one midterm as well, if it benefits your final grade.
Feedback is prompt, and Prof. Perlis is always willing to help you understand topics!

The bad:
Lectures can sometimes be a bit dry or repetitive - staying attentive can be difficult.
""B"" homeworks are quite a bit more challenging than the exams, and often require you to think outside the box to get full points.

My advice: GO TO CLASS. Ask TAs for help in discussion! Start your homeworks (especially ""B"") homeworks early. Also, ignore the older reviews for this class - Prof. Perlis no longer assigns quizzes in discussion.

julin,5,A,BCHM461,"I had Dr. Julin for both BCHM461 and BCHM462 in Spring and Fall 2015. My grades on the exams were B-C-B-A (BCHM461) and B-B-A-B (BCHM462) and I got an A in both courses. Brilliant man, very kind, dry sense of humor (but my friends and I thought it was hilarious), cares about students, and is a wonderful lecturer in biochemistry. He's responsive to e-mails and student concerns.

His notes are so clear and organized (except his arrows for mechanisms haha). He writes on the chalkboard and uses a powerpoint. Bchm is a hard class no matter how you look at it. He recommends (and so do I) that after every lecture or so, you recopy your notes and go through it to keep up. His exams are challenging, but absolutely brilliant in the way they make you think. They are definitely fair - they test what he teaches, though in novel ways. He gives you a bunch of his old exams to practice. Based solely off his lecture notes. 

I definitely recommend Julin (and so do my classmates).",325
julin,5,,BCHM461,"Julin is really smart and has a WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR!!! He's the sort of professor you see in movies; those who sits down and talks with you about all the things in the world. I found that charming! He inspires your imagination and your enthusiasm. His lectures are great and he sometimes make subtle not-so-innocent jokes which makes everyone laugh. I felt so free and happy, till I took his exams. If you love biochem or love the enlightening aspect of study, by all mean take it. If you need a good GPA, I suggest you look elsewhere. ",325
julin,5,B,BCHM465,"My method of studying in this class was to rewrite lecture notes, supplement lecture notes with book notes, and do previous exams. In the upcoming paragraphs, I’ll try to explain my mistakes. 
First, I did poorly on the first exam because I was not used to Dr. Julin’s exams. His exams are 6+ questions for the midterm and 11+ questions for the final, with the questions being free-answer, and sometimes multipart. To better prepare for the first exam, I should have done all of his practice exams and gotten a better feel for how he asks questions. Better understanding the material by going over all of his lecture notes would have helped too (the book is a supplement to the lecture notes; he only tests on stuff from his lectures, and the book has too much information.)
I did average (mean) to a few points above average on the rest of the exams and got the grade I got (he implemented some kind of curve). If I were to take another Julin-type class, I would look out for the following. 
His exam questions can be tricky in several ways. The type of question I had difficulty adjusting to was the question that required a “key”, or something we learned about during lecture. The question would seemingly be about something we did not learn about and would be asking you to extrapolate based on given information. I would guess the answer the first few times, without using the correct or any learned concept; these responses would turn out to be wrong. To fix this, I had to have a list of all the concepts (e.g. the specific DNA type’s handedness, the specific DNA type’s major and minor groove properties, the stability/energetic property of a bond) ready to be recalled and “placed” into the problem to see if it would answer the question, and an understanding of the definition of every part of the processes (e.g. DNA repair processes, DNA replication’s trumpet model) he talked about. 
The most frustrating part of his exams was that his questions were often unclear to me. In the questions I got wrong, I often had to guess what the answer should contain, as seen previously about the questions seemingly about something we did not learn, or I would misread a part of a question that I knew the answer to. Overall, I felt that while the regular professor’s exam question contains one part (know the answer to this question, perhaps through extrapolation of what you already know), Dr. Julin’s questions contained two parts (know what the question is asking about through careful reading and thought; then, know the answer, perhaps through extrapolation.) To fall for this would be my own fault, however; more careful reading comprehension would be a fix, perhaps through increased sleep. 
Here are some other useful pointers. Study the experiments by being able to recall what the experiment variables are. They were tested moderately. If you want a letter of recommendation, go to his office hours regularly. He explains concepts well, and will answer questions specific to things we learned (not usually questions about the exam, like ‘Is this on the exam?’” For the final, review everything, including experiments and 
In summary, Dr. Julin is a good lecturer and professor, and his exams tested less on a wide scope of knowledge, and more on how well you can understand questions and work with the material taught. I noticed that a decently sized group of students had B to A averages on the exams, meaning they probably got As after the curve (the uncurved exam mean was around a C.) Somehow, they were able to avoid the trickiness of the questions, perhaps by taking a class of his before, or perhaps through reading comprehension better than mine. 
",325
julin,5,B+,BCHM461,"TAKE HIM FOR BCHM461. There is a lot of mixed opinions about Dr. Julin and the truth is that this class is NOT easy, but he is hands down one of the best professors I have ever had. He is INSANELY smart, just from listening to him speak in lecture or office hours you will realize that this man in brilliant. It's because of this that it can be a bit of a disadvantage because I don't think he realizes how little some students may know. That being said he is the BEST biochem professor there is! A lot of students will say that he is a bad Gen Chem II professor but a great BCHM professor and this is true, that is because BCHM is his field of research.
His exams are tough, but honestly really fair. You have to study lecture notes. He doesn't surprise you with any ""new"" material. Whatever is on the exam will be from lecture. That being said I've found that the best method is to record his lectures and then recopy notes. RECOPY RECOPY RECOPY. It's a 400 level class, you honestly can't expect to look at your notes the two nights before the exam and do well. 
",325
julin,5,A,BCHM461,"Had him for 271 and he was terrible. When I found out I was having him for biochem (they switched teachers on us) I cried because he was so bad for Gen Chem 2. BUT I WAS SO WRONG. Julin KILLS it in biochem. I am so happy that I had him as a teacher. His style of teaching goes along with this topic material soooooo much better then gen chem 2. He really loves bio chem and is a great resource if you ever have questions. I have actually made my schedule next semester so that I could specifically have him again because HE IS AMAZING for biochem. Take him for biochem if at all possible, but avoid him at all costs for Gen Chem 2. His level of understand really reflects in his teaching. ",325
julin,1,C,CHEM271,"Hey, do you like learning physical/theoretical chemistry in a general chemistry class, spending most of class on derivations, tests with convoluted questions that are much harder than you would expect, and getting screwed over for the MCAT, then you'll fall head over heals in love with Julin, and I would highly reccomend him. If you prefer the opposite, go jump out a window before signing up for his class. The whole problem stems from the fact that Julin is a Biochemistry professor not a general chemistry teacher, and he has only taught this class like twice (which probably explains the difference in opinions below). If your the type of person who prefers to learn from the book, then you will have a major problem when taking Julin's class, since exams are only from class material. In addition, I agree with the review below from 5-22-14. Doing lots of practice problems won't help you one bit, since test questions are predominantly concept based. To succeed in Julin's class, you need to rewatch lectures (he records them) and pay attention to every word that comes out of his mouth. Other than that, there is really no way to prepare for his test. Unlike other classes where if you work hard, you are pretty much getting a good grade, that isn't true with Julin. His questions are so bizarre that for the Thermodynamics unit, he asked a question on the history of state functions, but didn't ask a question on Hess' Law, one of the most fundemental concepts for that unit. Gen chem 2 is not a hard class and the material is somewhat interesting, but Julin makes it a lot harder than it really needs to be. My reccomendation is to never take a biochemistry professor for a general chemistry class...",325
julin,1,B,CHEM271,"I actually liked the material in this class and found it to be very helpful for the MCAT. that being said, I couldn't enjoy it one bit thanks to this guy. Absolutely terrible professor, would never take this man again in my life. If your a chemistry major or you really like chemistry, then Julin might not be a bad idea, since his teaching style is that he focuses on the in depth theoretical side of chemistry, and about 2/3 of the tests are conceptual based as opposed to problems. Unlike other chemistry classes where you have to just understand how to do the problems, in Julin's class you really have to know your stuff inside and out. Just knowing how to do the problems won't suffice to get an A in this class. His tests are also nothing like the practice tests that he posts, so watch out for that. He always likes to have 1-2 test questions where you are like ""where the hell did that come from..."". Not to mention, his test questions aren't even similar in anyway shape or form to what he teaches in class.  Also, when you practice doing normal general chemistry problems, it's easy to get thrown off based on how much biochemistry is on his tests. Julin teaches this class like a 300-400 advanced chemistry class and wastes half of class deriving complex equations. There really isn't any point coming to class because you will not learn anything useful. Honestly, there isn't really any way to study for this class, since his tests aren't anything like practice tests, the book, or his lecture slides. I reccomend taking CHEM271 with another professor. Just to let you know how much I hate this man, I signed up for BCHM461 next semester originally with some other guy, however the minute that it got changed to Julin, I switched out in a heartbeat. ",325
julin,1,B,CHEM271,"Definitely not the worst lecturer ever, but he's certainly not far from it. I've had much worse professors here at UMD. Going to class is literally the biggest waste ever because Julin focuses more on the theoretical side rather than the important concepts. As a result, I feel that I've barely learned anything meaningful. In addition his tests also focus on the theoretical side rather than doing chemistry problems. WARNING: DO NOT get fooled by Julin's practice exams that he posts. He posts one thing, but the exam is literally 10 times harder than what he posts. His exams are also not fair in terms of length, as it is nearly impossible to finish his exams. The questions are also worded so wierdly that you will literally have no idea what the question is asking, when in fact it was actually a pretty easy question. In addition, nearly every question has a biochem example using biological molecules instead of normal chemistry molecules which throws everyone off. He tries to be helpful by offering review sessions, but they are absolutely useless. To sum up, as I said before, he isn't the worst lecturer ever as there are far worse, but I'd probably say he's the worst all-around professor when you take into account his teaching, tests, grading, and most importantly, how unfair of a teacher he is. Also, the general consensus is that he's great for biochem, but horrible for gen chem. ",325
julin,1,C,CHEM271,"Where to start... Well first of all, let me say that I can't think of a single professor at UMD where I've said this before, but there is absolutely nothing that I like about this man, whether it is his scowl on his face, his teaching style, the way he treats his students, his exams, his grading policy. I can't seem to find one positive thing about him. I seriously think that all the reviewers below were on cocaine when they wrote their reviews. Beyond the fact the he is the most unengaging lecturer ever, Julin's teaching and tests are not even closely related to the textbook, so you need to pay extremely close attention in class. His grading is so unfair that you must have exactly what is on the key to get credit even if you answered the question in a correct manner. If you go to him for a regrade and try to explain your point, he's so adamant and stuck up about his grading policy that he will not give you points. The worst part about this guy is the complex derivations that he does in class, and tries to incorporate calculus. Then when he makes a mistake he spends like 10 minutes trying to figure out what he did wrong. Julin tends to focus on random theoretical bullshit instead of explaining to students how to solve chemistry problems. In addition, on exams he includes so many BIOCHEMISTRY examples in a GENERAL CHEMISTRY class. 

Also, a word of advice. Many students come into this class cocky because they think that gen chem II is easier than orgo II; it's not. In fact, I now understand why they make you take gen chem II after orgo II. Honestly, the material in this class is not hard, but Julin makes this class 10 times harder than what it needs to be. I'm warning you, Don't take Julin. If I had known the truth about him earlier and not paid attention to the useless reviews below, I would have purposely pushed off gen chem to another semester, even if it means being behind in the chemistry sequence. ",325
julin,1,,CHEM271,"Honestly, I just made an OURUMD account so I could warn all other future students not to take Julin. He is probably the worst professor I've ever had. Supposedly he's great for Biochem, but he's literally THE WORST professor for general chemistry. I had Dr. Dixon for Orgo II and was spoiled, because when I came to Julin, I noticed that he is exactly the opposite (minus the hard tests). This man seriously cannot teach and he will make you fall asleep with his monotone voice. In addition to being a shitty teacher, Julin's tests are the most unfair thing ever. He tests you on the little minute things that are not important and doesn't test you on the major concepts in each unit. That's why you need to make sure that you know literally every little detail on every slide. Also, when you think of Chemistry, you are used to doing lots of algebraic calculations, not in this class. I'd say about 75% of the test questions are conceptual based rather than problem based. Not to mention, that when it comes to regrades, he is extremely stingy with regards to awarding back points. Even if you accurately explain your point and if it makes sense.

Being Pre-med, besides the fact that GPA is important, I don't believe that I have learned anything meaningful with Julin, and I don't feel more prepared for the MCAT then I was before I took his class. I never thought I'd say this, but I can't think of a class that I've had before where I felt it was hard to scrape by with a B. Whatever you do, don't do it to yourself. ",325
julin,2,B,CHEM271,"If you learn by doing practice problems THIS TEACHER IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!
He is actually against giving practice problems for his test. Or hw or just any practice in general.  You can try and study from the book and other teachers tests but they offer little help. The only way he says to study is to ""rewrite your notes"" which is very hard because he doesn't do any practice problems during class either. He teaches theory in a very complex way (this guy LOVES do derivatives for things you don't actually need to know) and then expects you to be able to apply it in a very complex way on the test. Because of the lack of practice problems I feel like I didn't fully learn anything. I am taking the MCAT this summer and GenCHEM is by far my worst section because I didn't get the proper back ground knowledge from this class. IF you actually care about knowing the material for the MCAT or any other test you are going to have to learn it completely on your own. His class doesn't prepare you. I have heard he is good for BioCHEM, but he is NOT a general chemistry teacher. IF you care about learning the material DONT DO IT. ",325
julin,1,,CHEM271,"Ok, so I heard that he was a very good Biochem professor, which might be true, but I can tell you that he is literally the worst gen chem professor ever. Not only is he a very poor lecturer, but he is extremely boring to listen to and his lectures are way too theoretical (he likes to focus more on proofs and concepts rather than teaching how to solve problems). That being said, the main reason I gave Julin 1 star is because he is the most unfair test writer ever. His tests focus on abstract theoretical concepts that were barely covered in class rather than solving chemistry problems. You really have to know your stuff inside and out to succeed on his tests. And whatever you do, make sure that you study EVERYTHING on the slides because the things that you thing he is least likely to test you on, he does. 

Bottom line: Stay away from Julin at all costs. If he is the only professor teaching for the semester, I reccomend pushing it off to another semester just to avoid taking Julin. ",325
julin,2,B,CHEM271,"Julin is one of the most bland professors you can ask for. During the lectures, he frequently went over the theory behind some of the material and ALWAYS derived equation after equation. This may be helpful, but he asks for none of this on an exam. One lecture he spent the entire class deriving a single equation. Also, he messes up in lecture a lot and makes plenty of mistakes. After a lecture, you can bet that there will be a follow-up email of him attempting to reconcile his emails.

His exams are absolute insanity. The first exam he expected us to finish 12 pages in just 50 minutes. Needless to say, almost nobody finished. Questions are always poorly phrased and there is absolutely no way to properly study for anything he writes. 

Julin is far from the best chem271 professor, but hell this course isn't even about chemistry. At this point, it's more physics/thermo/kinetics. ",325
julin,5,A,BCHM463,"Dr. Julin is the best.

I Had him for Chem271 and Bchm463.
He's a very good teacher.

4 exams total (75 points each) + Final exam (200 points) for a total of 500 points for the semester.

The first two exams cover Biochem 1.
The last two exams cover Biochem 2.

The class can seem a bit fast paced.
Definitely Study your notes. His tests are solely based on what he lectures. 
He held online review sessions on ELMS which were kinda helpful.

If you have to take this class, take it with Dr. Julin.",325
julin,4,C,BCHM463,"Real talk: Biochemistry is no walk in the park. Biochemistry II definitely isn't- probably among the hardest classes I took in my undergraduate years.

If you have to take BCHMII, take it with Julin. I didn't do so hot because I approached studying for the class the same way I did other chemistry courses, but it's just not the same.

To his credit Julin presents the complex material in a very straightforward fashion. His exams are a fair reflection of the material covered in class too- the real challenge is that you don't know what specific reaction, process, mechanism, etc. he's going to pick from those covered- so you have to know them all. And fyi the exams are it- no homeworks or anything else to supplement your grade- so make them count. I believe he drops one bad exam among the 3 midterms, followed by the final.
Even if you memorize everything correctly, make sure you can imagine them in other contexts. Julin's favorite thing to do is posit a situation, ie given a start compound and an end compound, and have you explain the mechanism or explain why you got one product instead of another using something we learned in class. 

The lectures are fairly boring tbh. The first few in BCHMII are just review- but once the review ends, DO NOT drop the ball. Do NOT miss a word from this man's lips, and do NOT miss a single diagram on the board, or in the blink of an eye you will have fallen behind, especially because everything builds on the material before it. Get a recorder. Fill in gaps in your notes with your friends'. Julin is a nice guy and very willing to answer questions and provide help, but if you don't take him up on that it's your loss (I know that was the case for me).

In BCHMII, you literally learn and memorize step by step the metabolic processes of the body. That's insane. It's cool and very interesting, but still completely nuts. Your memory will be worked to the core memorizing chemical structures and reactions and mechanisms. It's not about formulas (physics/chem classes), and it's not mainly about memorizing big concepts (bio classes). It's actually a lot like Orgo. Yeah. Actually, BCHMII is essentially applied Orgo. 

You can't avoid putting a lot of time and effort into this class. I recorded lectures, but didn't always go back over them and paid for it. No cutting corners- you just have to memorize and know your stuff. It's definitely doable, but woe to those who fall behind.

Also, I had the book but hardly touched it. He pretty much covers everything you need to know in class. ",325
julin,5,B,BCHM463,"Excellent professor. Makes the material very logical and simple to go through. 

Follow his tips for success and you should get that A. Go to office hours after you review the material and he will help you out. Read the book before and after class (but not too detailed), pay attention during class, and take very good notes. I tried to write down everything he said verbatim, especially when I didn't know what was going on that day.

For me, recording the lectures and rewriting my notes was super helpful in understanding what he was talking about. It took time, so try and get through the material quickly. It won't be so overwhelming if you keep up with lectures and study at least a week before each exam. The rewritten notes were very helpful when the final exam came. I was able to get the mechanisms in metabolism and such after I wrote them out neatly and practiced each like 5 or ten times so it was natural. He does test you on these (and everything in lecture), but the exams, like the class, are fair. The final was basically like the 4 exams.

Our class this semester was a bit worse than normal so I think it was about a 10 percent curve and he always makes the B/C line the average. I would have had an A if I didn't mess up on two exams and the final.study hard and Score more than maybe 60/75 (i guess?) on each exam and you should be ok for an A with a good final exam grade.

Our curve was approximately: A-=80;B-=70, C-=51, D=48.8%


Long story short: Excellent professor. take him.

Make flash cards for the amino acids.",325
julin,2,C,BCHM463,"I am not sure why everyone on here thinks this professor is brilliant. He isn't. I'm a good student and I study a lot for his exams, but his questions come out of nowhere. There is no homework due, so your whole grade is based on whether or not you can memorize every mechanism in the book. He doesn't test his students based on any overall concepts and any questions he asks that are actually similar to the homework problems he assigns for practice are worth approximately 4 points, but his random questions are worth 15. Also, his exams are insanely timed. He gives an 8 page exam and expects us to finish it in 50 minutes. You have to have everything memorized front and back to be able to finish on time. 
His lectures are clear, but boring and they don't really reflect what he tests on. I don't recommend him at all. Plus, he never smiles. I mean this guy wears a permanent scowl, leading me to believe he hates his job, which doesn't exactly make me very interested in it either. 
If you are a CHBE major or anything else that is not solely biology or general chemistry, you will not have the time to dedicate to this class and all the memorizing it entails.",325
julin,5,A,BCHM463,"Same as the other comments. Very nice during office hours, great lecturer, very knowledgeable. hard exams (comparable to Dr. Friedman's) but huge curve. ",325
julin,5,A-,BCHM461,"Dr. Julin is a wonderful professor and very willing to help his students learn. His teaching style is great - very similar to Dr. Dixon. I really enjoyed this class because I actually understood what I was learning and it connected all the dots between biology and chemistry courses previously taken.

I went to his office hours frequently and he was very helpful.

His tests were tricky but you really have to study hard and understand the concepts. You do have to memorize basic facts (i.e. amino acids, their pKas, and some other small things here and there), but it's mainly applying concepts.",325
julin,5,A,BCHM461,"Dr. Julin is a great professor! His lectures, as described in the reviews below, are well structured. He teaches on the whiteboard along with powerpoint slides of graphs  and pictures. He goes over the material a bit fast though. 

Make sure to take good notes because he tests on what he teaches. I think retaking notes helps a lot for studying. What I did was retake every lecture after class and even glue the slides on to my notebook. By this, you can know what you didn't understand in class and you can ask him questions through email or just after class. Looking over the sections of the book (he will say which pages) also helps because some definitions are not described very clear in class. 

He holds a review section a day before the exam/final for us to ask questions. He also answer emails pretty fast and clear. I ask about 2 sentences and he will reply me with a paragraph. 

As for the exams, study your notes and the sections of the book. His exams are difficult and are basically all short answers (lots of writing!) and some drawings. He likes to use the graphs and experiments described in class and ask what if happen if you change something. Study a week or two before hand, cramming and pulling a allnighter won't do any help. 

The averages for our exams were 66, 68, and 64. As for the final the average was a 75. For the final, it is not as detailed comparing to the exams but you still need to understand all the material !

As for the grade cutoffs(%), A>81.6, B>71.8, C>51.6, D>42.4, F>30.8. 

As long as you study, and know the material he teaches in class, you will do fine. 
",325
julin,4,C,BCHM461,"Julin is cool, but his exams are pretty difficult. Paying attention to his lectures can be challenging because you get bored after like 10 minutes.
The class is curved, and so every year the grades are based upon how that particular class does as a whole.",325
julin,5,,BCHM461,"He is simply a brilliant professor. He is very structured, organized, and rational. Very knowledgeable about the material. He lectures very clearly. 

He's not really funny though. ",325
julin,5,,BCHM465,"One of the most outstanding lecturers at the university. Dr. Julin has a great personality, his lectures are on point and well structured. He truly wants you to learn as much as you can and do well in his class. A lot of the course material was genetics review, but more in depth and interesting. 

There were a total of 5 problem sets, not difficult to do, but required some thinking. It really help me stay on top of the material. Exams were fair, first exam's average ~80%, then 60-65% for second and third exams. He really likes to ask questions about experiments and hypothetical situations on the exams.

Go to lecture, take notes, attend review sessions, you will do well. He's a keeper.",325
julin,5,A,BCHM462,"Dr Julin is probably one of the top lecturer in the department...

He's approachable, answers your questions completely, holds review sessions, answers emails within a day, comes to class fully prepared.  Even when I had an all-nighter, I can never fall asleep in his class for some reason.

His exams are not that hard if you really understand the material...questions usually involves making you think about a similar enzyme or similar mechanism...he uses applications on his exams (apply what you learned in class to another system)
the worst are the open ended questions because they are so ambiguous and unclear.  His averages are actually pretty decent.  I got 98%, 85%, 100% on his midterms.",325
julin,5,,BCHM462,"I really liked Professor Julin. He's a great lecturer, really gets the point across. Makes some strange but funny (maybe only to nerds like me) jokes. 

His exams are difficult in that it really tests understanding of the material he teaches, but I think they're pretty fair. I bombed the first test because I didn't know what I was expecting, but pulled up at the end. 

Definitely put your thinking caps on in this class, if you're going in just to memorize, I don't think you'll do as well as you expect. Lots of Mechanism, some facts, and physiological applications. Loved the class really felt like it was a logical organization that integrated chem/biochem/biology. 

I look forward to having BCHM3 with him next semester!

Oh and those of you who are reading just for this: large curve I think 45% was a C for my semester. ",325
julin,4,,BCHM465,"Fantastic lecturer... one of the best in the biochemistry department. He demands a higher level of thinking than just memorization. His problem sets and exams usually involve him giving experimental results and asking you to explain mechanistically how the results are possible. Tricky but a fair professor. Never went to his office hours, but he was kind of a jerk when I went to pick up a graded problem set that I wasn't in class to get.",325
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI135,"BSCI135 is a GREAT course. I would recommend this class for anyone who's trying to fulfill their Gen Ed lab credit. 

The material is very interesting, and he keeps the class engaged by throwing in some jokes here and there. You learn about food - what's there not to like?

He says there's an optional textbook you can get - don't get it. He bases his exam questions off of the powerpoints, some movies we watched, and articles we read.

There are a lot of extra credit opportunities at the end of the semester which is great for people close to jumping up a grade, and they're not hard at all. 

This class doesn't require a lot of effort - just put in some time to study for exams. The labs were easy and interesting as well - we got to cook food in lab! 

Take this course! You won't regret it. Moctezuma is a great, funny, and helpful guy and the TA, Annie, is the best! 

",326
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI124,"Moctezuma is super nice! Like literally one of the most understanding and genuinely nice professors I've ever had. He understands that a lot of people in the class are not science majors and tries to present the information in a way that applies to daily life.

The exams are straightforward. Usually 55 questions with 50 MC and 5 FITB. The only way you could fail these tests is if you didn't dedicate any time to studying or didn't come to lecture. It's all very basic. Moctezuma posts a study guide the week before and holds review sessions the week of. Your grade is an average of these 4 and they are NOT cumulative! The final is the fourth exam.

He also offers a ton of extra credit. Up to 25 points. I maxed out on extra credit this semester and managed to bump my grade up two letter grades (B+ > A- > A).

The corequisite lab is even easier than the main class. If you didn't get an A+ in the lab you either (a) didn't come or (b) are genuinely an idiot.

If you want an easy A and/or to fulfill you DNSL credit take this class!

The textbook is useless, save yourself the 75 bucks and don't buy it.",326
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI135,"The class itself is pretty easy. There were three exams that weren't hard, and in each class he had a worksheet based on the notes that day, which you typically turned in the next class. Labs were an absolute joke, and you often got to leave early. However, the lectures got kind of boring; you'd fill in one blank on a powerpoint, and otherwise basically not pay attention. There were a few extra credit opportunities, so definitely do those. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, all the exams were based off the powerpoints. 

Overall, easy class, the subject matter was interesting enough, and there was actually minimal info about real biology, it mostly focused on the nutrition of foods, how they're grown, and how they might affect you (i.e. caffeine wgives you energy, etc.). If you're a non-science major looking for a lab requirement, definitely take this class. ",326
moctezuma,3,B,BSCI135,"This class is super annoying for many reasons. It's super boring and easy in lecture. He gives you a powerpoint before each class with one word blanked on each page. You then listen to him ramble on for 75 minutes. The exams, though, are super difficult. They aren't what you're expecting at all. The exams are actually difficult! Pick one, Moctezuma! Hard or easy! The lab was easy, but TA John Clay is annoying.

Bottom line: Moctezuma is a cool dude you can probably grab a beer with, but this class is deceptively harder than it seems.",326
moctezuma,4,A+,BSCI124,"PERSONAL BACKGROUND:
I'm a English/Journalism major and needed a Lab Science. I heard this was the best class to fulfill this requirement.

CLASS CONTENT:
Dr. Moctezuma does his lectures in Power Point style. You fill out a fill-in-the-blank notes during class. 

EXAMS/ASSIGNMENT:
There is no homework.

There are 4 MC, uncurved exams, each worth 100 points. They are entirely lecture based. They are not tricky, but if you do NOT pay attention in class and/or study, you will NOT do well on the test. 

During the semester, you will have the opportunity to earn a maximum of 25 extra credit points that are basically tacked on to your final exam score total. So if you perform poorly on an exam, you can boost your final grade by a whole letter grade. 

TEACHER:
Dr. Moctezuma does a good job on making plants as interesting as humanely possible and relative to your lives. Also, he has a good, if somewhat dirty sense of humor. He is willing to help students if they are struggling with the class and easy to approach. 

CO-REQUISITE LAB (BSCI124):
Easiest lab I've ever taken. I had B. Gonzales and got out at least 30 mins. early almost every lab.

OVERALL:
I have no interest in science, often fell asleep during lectures, and suck at memorizing large amounts of information. I still got an A and would recommend to this class for all non-science majors.

Because all assignments and exams are ENTIRELY lecture based...
DON'T BUY THE BOOK. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. DON'T BUY THE BOOK.",326
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI124,"Professor Moctezuma is the best biology teacher I have ever had. He knows his stuff, and he makes the material easily accessible.  He brings in things like coffee for class when you discuss stimulating plants, and he always has a presentation or joke in his slides to make lecture interesting.

As long as you go to lecture to fill in the slides he posts online, you are almost guaranteed an A. Even if you do poorly on a test, it is fairly easily to keep on top of your grades with all of the extra credit that he gives. If you need to take a science CORE class, this is definitely the one to take.",326
moctezuma,5,,BSCI124,"Hands down best lab science at UMD.  Textook is helpful but is definitely not necessary.  The lab is scheduled for two hours but we never spent more than an hour in it.  The tests are straightforward. Just by doing all of the easy take home quizzes you add 2.5% to your overall grade in extra credit.  If you hate science, take this class.  I hated science and still do, but loved this class.",326
moctezuma,5,A-,BSCI124,"I loved this class.

I never missed a lecture, mostly because of the fact that he does not put the slides online and we have to fill in the blanks on the powerpoint slides. But it did help that he was funny in his own way too.

He's a really nice guy who you can tell cares about his students and wants his students to do well.

One thing that makes the class awesome is the fact that the exams are not cumulative, all four weigh the same amount, so if you're struggling in the beginning, you can still make it up by studying hard for the last one.

I'll admit that I only studied hard for two of the exams, but I still did well - and I DESPISE science. Like I really do.

He doesn't curve, but that is because he gives extra credit, so make sure to do those. It really makes a difference.",326
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI124,"He's the nicest guy ever, and he tries to make things as fun and interesting as possible. Pretty much a guaranteed A, provided that you study for the four tests. He also offers SO much extra credit.",326
moctezuma,3,,BSCI124,"When taking this class I was under the impression it was super easy from the reviews. I was also recomended by my advisor to take this class because science is not my strong suit. I found the first exam to be the hardest. The material is not difficult, but there is just so much to study all at once that it's easy to get mixed up. Moctezuma is a very nice and makes lectures not as dry. Do go to lecture! ",326

moctezuma,5,B,BSCI124,"This guy is really nice and actually cares about his students. Lectures are  interesting even if you aren't a big science person because he relates things back to real life and throws in the occasional joke or two. I only wish the class was earlier so I could have woken up for it more often. 

Your grade basically comes down to 25% Exam 1, 25% Exam 2, 25% Exam 3, and 25% Final. You may think you know everything going into the first test, but if you don't study you will fail. Don't buy the book it's pointless, just go to class or get the lecture notes. TESTS ARE BASED ON THE LECTURE NOTES SO STUDY THEM. 

He also offers an insane amount of extra credit that can help you. I didn't get over a B on the first three exams but managed to do a bunch of ec at the end of the semester and still pulled off a B. Overall it's a pretty easy class that you can definitely get an A in if you put in a little effort. 
",326
moctezuma,5,B,BSCI124,"I LOVED THIS CLASS! I don't care much for science and I failed a the Insects CORE. I should have listened to my gut and taken this class to begin with. 

Moctezuma knows his stuff, and he's so nice. 

I highly recommend this class. Don't be discouraged by Test I. It gets better. Also, go see him in office hours and do the extra credit. 

Great class, great professor, great TAs. Thanks Grace!",326
moctezuma,5,A,BSCI124,"Moctezuma is the man.

And I hate biology. I very much dislike science. But Moctezuma actually made plant-biology *shutter* as interesting as possible. 

I found him very funny. If you paid attention you would pick up on all his little humor cues.

You DO have to go to class. I had it at 9:30 am. It sucked it was so early. However, I never went to two 10:00 am's and two 11:00 am's this semester, but I always attended his 9:30 class.

All the information on the tests is given in class. The class is structured VERY well. If you go to class (which is TOTALLY manageable for a course like this), and you are even half decent in picking up cues for what is going to be on the test, you will do fine.

Note: I feel like the vast majority of the class struggled. Thats because nobody went to class. I am somebody that misses many other classes, but I did not miss this one. Going to class is essential for the A. The book is NOT a supplement for his class. The power points have blanks that need to be filled in during class. Its very easy considering. In fact, don't even bother getting the book. 

Also, there is a fair amount of extra credit you can get throughout the semester. And most of it isn't annoying extra credit. You can get up to 7.5% extra credit added to your final grade if you do it all. And most people did.


I highly suggest to take this class if you need it for core. It won't get better than this.

All in all, Professor Moctezuma is the man. Just one little example to leave you guys with: For one of the extra credit assignments we had to fill out a quiz about psychoactive plants. One of the questions was about if you supported the legalization of marijuana or not. Then it asked to explain why. At this point of the year I had a high grade so I didn't take the extra credit seriously, so I quoted the Notorious B.I.G. for my answer: ""Life's ***** and then you die, thats why we get high, 'cause you never know when you gonna go."" The T.A.s grade the quizzes, and I'm almost certain that mine was horrified and took it straight to Professor Moctezuma to show him. Instead of getting zero credit, he doubled the extra credit points for my assignment, and make a joke about it during lecture. He didn't call me out because he didn't want to embarrass me, but he used it as something to spice up the average class day.

 Professor Moctezuma is a champ. Give him a chance and it will be very evident. Probably my favorite college professor.",326

The exams are tough because they cover over 400 slides worth of information. There's also only 4 of them! One poor result and 25% of your grade is gone.

I was attracted to the course as it seemed to be a fairly easy gen-ed for non-cs majors but as soon as you start the class, you see the content is a lot and although it isnt too hard, the exams are very tough. The exams are all multiple choices and he asks very specific questions  that you would find hard to answer unless you treated this course like a major course. During Spring 20, he informed the online class that the exam would take place on the lockdown browser 20 MINS BEFORE the midterm. We all had to struggle to download and many of the students had difficulties with the software too. He did not seem to care at all. Overall, suggested to never take a course with this teacher again unless you're a bio major. ",326
moctezuma,3,A+,BSCI124,"Besides the inconvenient, last-min lockdown browser issues (I took this class spring 2020), the class itself wasn't bad. His lectures were, in my opinion, not engaging whatsoever--I only attended them because he had us fill out blank PPTs that were only available in lecture. If you memorize (literally memorize, not even study) the PPTs, you'll get at least a B on exams. BSCI125 (the lab) was super easy as well. ",326

The lecture don't really help the homework and exams. He can be boring but this class is doable. Exams aren't computationally difficult, just review his old exams and you should be fine.

kempton,5,A,ASTR101,"The course was pretty well managed. She made sure there was a variety of material in an interesting manner. HWs were challenging but I felt like I learned a lot from them, though some weren't happy that the questions were not in the same format as the exams.",330
haag,5,A,BSCI207,"I am taking this class right now and I love it. There is a lot of material covered, but the exams are very fair. You can drop one exam, but I honestly don't even think I need to. He is a very nice teacher and is very helpful during office hours. ",333
haag,1,A,BSCI207,"I feel sort of bad giving Dr. Eric a bad review because he's genuinely a very nice person but just... this class was hell. It was horrible. It was disorganized and totally incomprehensible. The sheer quantity of material that gets covered is insane. I want to be mad at the professors for it but I don't think it's entirely their fault I think it's just a bad course. This information shouldn't be taught all in one class. You learn nothing because you can't organize it, and studying sucks and is inefficient. Two professor's teach this class because they can't get one person who knows everything that's covered. You can ask a question about some of the material to one professor and they won't know the answer because it's the other professor's specialization. Can I give UMD a bad review for making this a class?? 

I love biology. It's been my favorite since I was 3 years old and I'm 100% solid in my major choice but this class made me hate it for the first time ever. I dreaded learning bio and studying bio. Poor Dr. Eric, guy probably did the best he could with the shit material.

That being said, we did group projects which I hardly found helpful beyond finding people to complain about the class with. I feel like they just need work, they were (like most of the class) badly organized and confusing and the point behind them was never clear until you re-read them 3 times alone while studying. ",333
haag,2,B,BSCI207,"Nice guy, bad teacher. He wasn't even familiar with half of the information he was teaching us and admitted it to the class during lectures. He's very nice with a great personality but I question why he's teaching a class if he doesn't know the material....",333
haag,2,C+,BSCI207,"I was taught by Dr. Haag in BSCI207. It was his first semester teaching this course and he was as clueless as can be. He was not very familiar with the course material (even admits he teaches himself the material the night before a lecture). He is a very nice guy but not very knowledgeable. But I can't bash him for that because he probably didn't want to teach this awful course. Haag is a developmental biologist who teaches upper level bsci classes. Haag could be funny sometimes and he is a nice guy. I am sure he is a much better professor when teaching an area of his expertise as opposed to bsci207 which he has never taught before. However, if you are debating which bsci207 to take, you won't be stuck with just Haag, the class is usually taught by 2 or 3 professors which could get annoying. Enjoy...",333
haag,2,C,BSCI430,this class was not up to par with some other science classes. Dr Haag was dry although he was really in to the material. His exams were more analytical then concept based.  He didn't go by the book. You had to learn how to take his exam not only the material.  Its a good class to take if you want to be seriously challenged. I think his exams were not fair although the average on the exams went up each exam because people were getting used to him rather then understanding more. I dont recommend him. ,333

thomson,5,A+,CPSD101,"Ms. Thomson is very nice and is super approachable. Only thing that was annoying was that sometimes due dates would be confusing on Canvas, so you'd have to email for confirmation, and she'd update them.

golub,1,B+,CMSC131,"Wow.... Where to start with this monster of person. Not only does he have the most dry sense of humor but it's like he's allergic to teaching in general and avoids it at all fucking costs... IT'S YOUR DAMN JOB MAN don't tell us stories about some bullshit NASA stuff you made up and how people were just begging to use your code. We get it... comment our code yeesh just teach the damn class. 
The only reason I plan to get a relatively high mark is because I taught myself out of class... I have 100% on all of the projects and labs but shit grades on the exams. Wanna know why??? well i'll tell you... THE MAN DOESN'T TEACH YOU WHAT HE ASKS ON THE EXAM.... although there could just be a situation we may never considered about his case.
He could be a savant and only understand coding and can't comprehend how to interact with other humans or do his job... If that's the case I'm sorry for my tone",343
golub,2,B+,CMSC351,"Golub was a terrible professor. It was extraordinarily difficult to pay attention in his class because he talked about the material in such a fluffy way.
There was no concrete information on the slides, and the copies that he put online were half complete and didn't show the work he wrote in class.
Also, he refused to put full solutions to homework and thought questions online, which made it very difficult to study by myself.
Overall, I was extremely unhappy with how little I felt I learned from this course. You need a professor who can teach the material much more clearly and in a concrete way, not one where he blabs for half the class.
I also don't feel that I learned at all how to apply the knowledge I learned from this class to anything I would see outside of this class.

He was also very strict and not willing to be accommodating of student concerns for the most part.",343
golub,5,A,CMSC131,"Basically if you're the type of person that's pretty good with computers and knows his stuff, and goes to lecture, this guy is for you.

I've had 11 years of computer programming experience since elementary school, so I found this class to be far too easy.

But I don't think he's a bad professor. He asks questions to make sure people are involved, and he gives hints on what might be on quizzes, etc.

Basically, he says to study daily, and YOU SHOULD. I studied C++ in middle school on my own, so these concepts are familiar to me. Also, review the quizzes for the tests.

If you have questions, try to go to his office hours to ask a question. But to be honest, he won't help nor will the TA really help. You really have to figure out what's wrong with your program yourself. Once you get to JUnit Tests, make sure to write little junit tests for each method as you go along. That will help a lot. With your JUnit tests, you can figure out what's wrong easily unlike the submit server's JUnit tests.",343
golub,1,,CMSC131,"He was a horrible professor. He talked about himself the entire class and what you needed to know and why you needed to know it, but would never actually teach you how to do it. His exams were long and difficult and if you need 20 seconds to finish a line of code he will scream his head off and literally rip the exam from your hand. He does not teach the material and leaves it up to the TA. So if your TA sucks good luck in the class. I never learned a thing from his class even though I attended lecture, reviewed daily, and bought the book. Whatever you do, do not take this exam.",343
golub,1,,CMSC131,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Worst professor I have ever encountered.  Lectures are the most pointless waste of time(I went to everyone) where he spends time going off on tangents that have nothing to do with computer science. Extremely harsh grader when comes to projects and tests.  Due to the snow he attempted to cram every project into the semester, the last being due in a week as we also have finals to study for.  If you have zero experience in Computer Science avoid. The tests are tough and so are the projects expect to put a lot of time into this class. He must enjoy wording the most complex questions into exams. Dont be mistaken if you have learned anything by the end of this class its because of your TA or the people you decided to work with, how Golub has a job here is astonishing.  He gives you study questions that, guess what, have no real impact on tests and quizzes :). Dont believe any of the reviews that rate him from years ago as they do not reflect Golub's terrible teaching strategy.  Not to mention his condescending attitude when faced with question, prepare to be spoken to like a baby.  As an intro course designed for people new to Computer Science courses the workload was by far too heavy his expectations are flawed for students. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",343
golub,1,C,CMSC131,"By far the worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. First off his lectures are terrible. You don't learn a thing from them. He just talks about life experiences and why you need to know something but he never actually teaches it to you. He's so self conceited you'd think the class was named GLUB131. All he talks about is himself. Impossible to pay attention through the stories in his lectures so when he does actually say something related to the class, you're not paying attention to it. He is BATSHIT insane. Would literally rip students tests out of their hands and yell at them at the top of his lungs for finishing a line of code on tests seconds after he said stop writing. Least personable and reasonable person I've met in my life. Comes off as if he hates all of his students. I received a 77.954 average after putting in more work for this class than any other by far and he wouldn't give me the C+ for the class. DO NOT take this class even if it is the absolute last option. You'll regret it. Golub is just the worst candidate for a teacher. I have no clue who hired him with his psychological brain, but he needs to be fired. Doesn't help a soul being there. ",343
golub,1,F+,CMSC131,"Imagine the first day of class. As you embark on your journey through the mystifying complex universe of computer science, you have no idea what to expect. You could be dealing with the unforeseen; singularities caused by Eclipse phenomenons, encounters with fierce, atrocious bugs on the submit server, or even bang you head on your very own $800 laptop as you scream at the ambiguous results of the release tests! A toilet bowl of intellectual thoughts flurries around your noggin; there could be computers, video games, cameras, programming, computers, flying cellphones, virtual pinball and more!
Then all of a sudden.
BAM!
Golub's hairstyle is crazy – he’s like the Yoda of comp sci. Don't underestimate his powers.
As soon as you walk through the door, the surrounding air temperature drops 30 degrees as you witness the epitome of the human race. A majestic white haired dude strides across the lecture hall and spreads his arms openly– with a devilish grin on his face – so fast you could have blinked and missed the moment of a lifetime. (I strongly advise bringing a camera to savor the moment)
Golub E., or professionally known as “Evan de Golub”, is a retired super villain who now only uses his powers for forces of good….. for students of the CMSC major at the University of Maryland. He wears a silk vest every day - except on every other Friday. However, I personally felt like when he wasn't wearing the vest his lectures were more interesting and remained on topic. (Escalating theories in the scientific community that this very vest may have been part of his original super villain costume - and retains faint traces of pure evil.)
His vest is swaggy doe. Props to him.
Although his receding hairline may fool you upon first glance, he has a magnificent pony tail and has the full-fledged back-head experience. But keep in mind he is no Lebron James. Golub is an extremely young person – his hair is only grey from an abundance of knowledge and sagacious wisdom he has accumulated throughout his career. (One, of course, which would take the average man many lifetimes to equal.) Golub is a young warrior, holding years of experience computer sciencing, playing wacky poker in the devious back rooms of mobster hideouts, taking photographs of people’s feet and farm animals, and executing simulations of the mass genocide of pond fishies. But don’t let me spoil the extravagant, Oscar-worthy backstory though. Let the Golub himself reveal it to you through his eloquent novel-worthy lectures which leave you hanging on an epic, thrilling cliff hanger after each 51 minute session. But don’t worry my fellow Golub-goers, he always comes back the next week to continue the story almost where he left off, even after he has given tests that were not on the future topics he touched in the lectures – but on the stuff you should’ve KNOWN ALL ALONG FROM THE START. Damn, this guy practically wrote Inception. (Before Christopher Nolan bought the rights to it.) 
Anyway, at first his lectures might seem pointless, spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing - but don’t let that fool you.  In each session there is a small ten second topic that will become a pivotal test question somewhere down the road. Trust me. All of the spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing tangents he goes on are actually tests, testing the mental capacity of all 140 stude– I mean 45 students who bother to show up- in search for a new padawan. So if you want the prestigious position of “Golub padawan” on your resume, it’s best you sign up right now and claim your first row seat.
I strongly advise not bringing a computer to his lecture – this only distracts you from the true Golub-glorified experience. His signature hand gestures during his elegant lectures engage full houses of students – from all over the world- elevating them to the balls of their feet as he tells witty jokes that no one listens to. Seriously, one time someone almost let out a giggle and the whole universe practically collapsed inward upon itself and imploded. 
I suggest bringing the classic pen and notepad – which were the slim-lined computers Golub himself used when growing up in college – not those vintage clay tablets developed by the Mayans. (They’re too intricate for the average man!) No matter which type of device you plan to bring, always stare at it and never make eye contact with the master while he speaks – this is a sign of challenge, an instinct Golub has picked up from his years chillin with lions and tigers and preforming weird combos to their portraits.
Golub is a man with an infinite bag of tricks – did you know he was bilingual? Early on he’ll amaze you with a programming project that no only asks you to prompt the user in English, but also in SPANISH?!!?! hhhhoooooowwwWWHHHHAAAAAAA?!!?!?! This man is a genius. You’ll soon learn the concept of accounting for different cultural values and measurement systems because Golub exposes the flaws of NASA and unit conversions. During his reign as supervillain, Golub encountered the forces of NASA and recollects how the US measurement of distance was different that Europe’s system, causing the NASA probe to crash (wasting the hundreds of millions of dollars Golub could have used for world domination). He references this story at least once every week, which now in hindsight, I think was a reoccurring subliminal message for comp sci students: don’t trust NASA.
Not only will you embark on pointless, unnecessary projects while other classes are sticking closer to reality, Golub will personally teach you the secrets to his mischievous trade of the wacky poker underground. His wacky poker project seemed too wacky for my taste, but then again, I was never playing a high stakes poker game with 300 zoo animals on the line. Golub is truly a modern superhero. When I took this class I never expected to learn essential life skills including: what Rwanda’s flag looks like in 3 bit-resolution, how to do calculus in Martianese notation, how to program, or even the science behind a fish pond exploiting the true concepts of Darwinism. 
But now I know, and I shall hold on to these precious gifts dearly as I move on with my life.
If you have been missing a real Bill Nye the science guy in your life, then this is the opportunity of a life time. Golub is a golden star, which luckily this review system can represent for future generations yet to come.

1st out of 5 stars
Would take again…… And audit too if forced by gunpoint.

golub,1,,,"Unfortunately, Professor Golub is a decidedly average instructor/lecturer. He's not at all clear about his expectations, and is condescending to the point where it seems one of his primary goals is to leave you feeling inferior to him. 

Questions about the subject matter are often met with replies that don't answer the question, and his expectations for students are arbitrary and unequal. This is reflected in communications with him both in person and via email (and unfortunately he's not very responsive over email either).",343
golub,1,C+,CMSC131,"Terrible professor. Avoid at all costs for your own sanity. The people who give him good reviews are the students that already know everything there is to know about computer science and find his jokes and stories amusing. He spends sometimes up to half of the class telling stories about things he used to do in previous coding jobs that have absolutely nothing to do with the material you are learning, then gives you quizzes on the same material.
If you are even somewhat of a visual learner that needs to see how things work, do not take Golub. He explains everything using stupid metaphors that he finds helpful and almost never shows actual code in java. Exams are not very similar to the study question posted. As someone below me said, he definitely leaves core topics to the TA's and barely teaches anything in class. So if you have a bad TA, you are in a terrible position.
",343
golub,2,C,CMSC250,"His lectures are good but he's very self-absorbed, biased and will passive aggressively undermine students he doesn't like. He wastes lecture time on repeatedly describing his past exploits catching proofing errors in other people's work, but then leaves core topics for TAs to teach in discussion.  

Too few exercises & worked problems overall. Pedantic, with heavy focus on empty formalism.  He starves his course without adequate worked problems, especially since he places so much emphasis on extremely formal procedural steps.  You often can't tell if you got points off because of some formal expression nicety you didn't follow or because your whole proof was wrong.  It's difficult to learn well when you have only a couple of examples for each core topic to work off.  If he didn't leave so much core teaching to his TAs, the discussion sections could be used for more exemplars and working of problems, but as it is there is inadequate work.

He compensates for this all by having limited coverage of topics and never gets to graphs at all.  All he really cares about (obsesses over) is formulaic formalism, it seems.

Yet, he hands out a lot of A's simply because students who want to memorize off the few worked examples you get and the limited coverage his course provides can do well in his classes.  The people who have it worst are those who want to do their own work (not get solutions from other people) and not memorize problem-solving.

The average students who do well in his class are ones who band together and pool their resources to create a set of solved problems.  What they are doing in effect is compensating for how he starves his course for worked problems and exercises.

His personal biases and prejudices against individual students comes across strongly at times in the classroom, like when he snaps impatiently at a student he clearly thinks is a fool.  Personality and appearance-wise, he's rather like that character in the Simpsons who runs the comic book store.",343
golub,1,A,CMSC131,"Horrible Professor.

I've taken 115 credits of classes, and this professor is honestly the most incredibly lackluster and astoundingly nitpicky professor I have ever seen.

The first lab was a total disaster, Golub cannot plan logistically at all.  He tried to have over 100 students download eclipse at the same time to complete failure.  This was then supplemented by him blaming the students for this failure, and making the due date for the first lab the next morning (this was considered ""being nice"")  I submitted the project the next AFTERNOON, to which Golub was apparently physically incapable of giving me any points for.

So there you have it!  If you want a teacher who will fail you three days into the class for his own complete incomptence with logistical issues, this is the man for you!

I've aced every other assignment he's ever assigned (taken the class in HS), but for your average student, this teacher should be avoided like the plague.

Emad is way better, sat in on his lectures, and Emad is much more entertaining/worth going to lecture for.",343
golub,5,,CMSC131,"I took 131 with very little prior programming experience (I took a god-awful class in Java when I was a senior in high school). Regardless, Golub's exceptional style of teaching not only drilled all the fundamentals securely into my mind, but also sparked a passion for programming in me. 
He does NOT read off slides; he does NOT drone on the entire lecture. (We all know a professor like that!) He buttresses every concept he covers with fantastic analogies, anecdotes from his own impressive career, and examples of practical implications. 
He takes clicker polls, which may annoy some, but which I found helpful; they motivate you to attend all lectures (which you should anyway) and they help you commit the more important points in a lecture to memory.
His quizzes are perfectly fair as are his projects. His project descriptions are especially great - visually appealing, lucid, and not too wordy.
He is not as quick with email responses as some other professors, but he is alright. And he always welcomes questions before/after lecture and at office hours. He is a very approachable individual who gives students' questions a good amount of consideration.
I have nothing negative to say about him! Look elsewhere in this page for vicious criticisms (LIES, I TELL YOU! haha).

TIPS: 
Sit closer to the front; it'll help you pay attention, participate, and be entertained.
Manage your time well in the exams.",343
golub,5,A,CMSC131,"Dr. Golub has received a few negative reviews, but I disagree with them. 

Sure, he's a bit on the crazy side(good crazy), but that's par for the course in college-level science courses, especially in the UMD Computer Science dept(according to friends of mine who are Comsci seniors).  

Dr. Golub's teaching style in CMSC131 regularly includes real-world examples and previews of things to come in future CMSC courses.  Dr. Golub and his TAs this semester kept a very wide amount of office hours(26 Office hours/week for our course, in addition to the 5 50-minute inclass hours each week).  You likely will not need the textbook if you're paying attention in class.

Grading wise, the 2 tests had 105 points but graded out of 100(5 point curve).  For our class, the median on the 1st test was 79, and the 2nd test was 80.  In addition he dropped the lowest quiz and the lowest lab grade.  Grading for this course was pretty lenient, and it is very possible to earn a little over 100% in the course.

I can't comment on how effective he is at teaching as I took this course with a decent amount of prior knowledge of the material.

On the course webpage, we had access to study questions and answers for each week, the powerpoint slides, project descriptions, and some code examples.  The study questions and answers are very helpful in preparing for quizzes and tests, and pretty much all you need to study from.  The slides were pretty much a skeleton of what's covered in class, and were not much help if you had to miss a class or 2.  Project descriptions were clear about what was and wasn't allowed in a certain project, and how to obtain the maximum points.  I can't comment on the code examples as I didn't look at them often.

",343
golub,3,A,,"I am an engineering major and I found this class to be ridiculously easy. It is by far the easiest CORE class. There were 5 projects and the lowest grade I got on them was a 95. He gives step by step directions so its really easy to finish them. The last graded project was to create webpages which was the most fun and useful thing we did in class.
His class is really boring and hard to stay up in. But he has clicker questions for attendance, so I tried to be there as much as possible.
He assigned two papers which I completely BS-ed and got an A on both. For the exams, I looked at all the lecture notes (which he posts online) and I got A's on the exams.
If you are good with computers or are an engineering major, definitely take this class. It is an easy A. Just make sure to take you laptop to class or have other stuff to do because its the most boring class ever!",343
golub,4,A-,CMSC131,"Golub was an okay teacher. His lectures were pretty boring and not always helpful, but he was very approachable and always willing to help. The quizzes were very difficult however. Fawzi Emad is the better option for CMSC131 and 132.",343
golub,1,,CMSC351,"This guy is the worst, one of the worst professors ever. Don't pay attention to any of the good reviews, they come from people who got good grades because of his ""curve"", who studied in groups and did the homework in groups. His curve only benefits people who do well on his exams. 

Yeah...this class is easy if you study really hard everyday, attend every lecture, studying in a group, ask questions about everything, and pay attention to every little detail

Otherwise if you don't do ALL of those things you won't get a good grade, now that's what an easy class is. You are technically not allowed to work together on homeworks but I'm guessing the good reviewers who studied in groups did anyway.

You basically have to study in groups or be very good at algorithm theory in order to get a good grade",343
golub,3,A+,CMSC351,"I don't know what the deal is with what ALMOST EVERYONE told me but this class has been fairly easy. One thing to note about this class (which is perhaps why I found it easy) is that the material that you learn is actually extremely relevant to the field of computer science. If you tackle the material with that attitude you're bound to do much better in the class. I have had internship interview questions based on material learned in the class -- so learn the material any way that you can!

The only thing about Golub's class is that you need to be in lecture. You need to learn how he wants all of the problems' solutions to be set up -- exactly the way he does them in class. Do your best on homework and try to imitate his examples in lecture to get the best grade. Also, definitely do the thought questions -- get a study group. I can't stress this tip enough. His exams seemed to be based much more on the thought questions than the homework questions (how convenient..) -- and if you've done the thought questions, you're bound to ace the exam.

Go to office hours if you are confused about something. He actually is very helpful in office hours (not necessarily in class), just make sure that you have notes from class because the first thing some of the TA's and Golub sometimes asks is ""okay, well lets look at your notes.""

If you do miss a class make sure to get the notes from someone else. If you miss some classes you can still get away with an awesome grade, but if you miss even a single one of the classes where he discusses critical material, you're grade will drop like a rock unless you have access to someone else's notes.

All three of our midterms were pick 4 out of 5 questions. It was not this way in the past semesters (not for all 3 exams anyway) so don't bank on it, but it did make the class a hell of a lot easier. He also tells you he weighs grading as follows: 17% per exam, 14% homeworks+quizzes+projects, 35% final. For us, he changed it to 12% lowest midterm, 17% middle midterm, 22% best midterm, and for the homework section (which totalled 150 pts), he took the score out of 125 instead. 

He also seems to curve exams arbitrarily..but everyone else has already touched on how he curves. Our first exam was taken out of 88 points, our second was 95, and third 97 or so. I would have expected a much higher curve for the second exam, which makes me wonder where he gets his numbers from (the 12 point curve on the first exam was unnecessarily high, but I'm not going to complain).

Also, the book is unnecessary.

I would have given him 4 stars but if you try to ask him questions right after an exam even if it's unrelated, he will yell at you. He is also very condescending sometimes. Even if you have a legitimate question he will cut you off and say ""I'm not answering those questions right now"" or ""I can't solve new problems for you right now"" or ""that's not relevant to the topic"" even if a) it's a general conceptual question, b) you're not asking him to solve a new question, and c) it is relevant to the topic. Golub many times (not always) assumes that his students are idiots and comes off as being extremely mean and as someone else has said, his head can be very far up his ass.

Finally, when you're taking a test, make sure to get your question across if you have a legitimate question. Many times the TA's too (and Golub) may think you're fishing for the answer even when you're not. This has happened so many times it makes me want to smack them and tell them to listen to my damn question before cutting me off. You're basically on your own.

Also I don't know what the other people are smoking who gave him 5 stars. I ended up with ~99.5% (so it's not like I'm biased against or bitter about his grading) in the class and I still think he was not a very ""patient"" and ""approachable"" and friendly guy who cared for his students...",343
golub,4,A,CMSC351,"I don't see where the hatred stems from. All the negative reviews about this guy and all the complaints about how ridiculously tough the material is - is complete bullshit.

I am by no means, a top student. I merely got a B in CMSC250, and that was with a curve. I found this class to be somewhat enjoyable and predictable in terms of what would be on the exam.

I agree with the guy below me, form study groups. Most of the ""lone warriors"" ended up failing the course, or barely passing with a C.

If you honestly go to all lectures, office hours, and do all the homework problems and thought questions intuitively, then you have no problems getting a B or higher.

The guy was nice enough to curve exams (although randomly and not by much) and drop 25 hw points.

Verdict: Go to every class, attend office hours if you sincerely get stuck, form a productive study group, and do ALL the homework and thought questions. Assuming you aren't the type to choke during exams, you should net a relatively A or B.",343
golub,2,,CMSC351,"This course is pretty easy in my opinion. Especially if you found cmsc250 easy, this one is similar. However, the professor himself is a total loser and a-hole. First of all, he thinks he's the smartest person alive, talking about how he can do pretty much any proof alive and how him and his friends go around cracking systems. He will tell you countless stories every class about how he outsmarted one thing or another. It's funny one kid told me about how we should do a drinking game where everyone takes a shot whenever he boasts about himself.

Of course, all professors have some ego but that is not why he's a terrible professor. He can be excessively rude and repressive during lecture and office hours, up to the point where he will yell at you if you ask a question he finds trivial. Personally, I went to his office hours once to explain how he did a certain proof, and he yelled at me, ""okay you are not doing this the way i mentioned in class, you have to pay attention!"" Forget about even asking any tangential questions, because he will automatically shoot down anything that's not related to the topic at hand. His default response: ""we're not talking about that. see me in office hours."" Also if you approach him with your own problem and ask him to solve it, he refuses to do so out of concern that others won't get a chance to see the solution.

As other people have mentioned, he does not post up lecture notes or worked out examples, so you must attend class or get notes from someone else. the only good thing i have to say about the class is that his exams are reasonable and predictable; there is very little deviation from his homework and thought questions. Also, he is generous in that he allows you to answer 4 out of 5 questions and curves each exam score. I was able to coast through this course with an easy A, but I still hated the professor.",343
golub,5,,CMSC351,"Okay number one if your major is computer science you should be expecting hard courses. The teacher is a great teacher, provides plenty of extra help and if you DO NOT wait until the day of the exam you can get plenty of help. He will explain something as many times as necessary until you completely comprehend the topic. He does not post his in class notes online because he wants to encourage student to attend class and once again if you are a computer science major you should not be looking for the easy way out. The class takes place in the afternoon so there is no excuse to not attend class. His Homework’s are fairy difficult however, if you email him or seek help during his office hours he will provide you plenty of help and clues. His test can be Extremely hard or Extremely Fair, it’s all based on how much you have actually learned. It is not impossible to get an A in his class. Also, he is very patient, approachable and does not make you feel stupid for not understanding a topic. Also, he cares about his students!!!!
I would recommend him to other students.
",343
golub,4,B,CMSC351,"Such a lovely person. He's always so nice and smiling to you whenever you talk to him. 

He made such a amazing adjustment for the percentage distribution to try to help the class.

He has a unique way of encouraging students to go to his class and office hours, yet it's really helping people to understand and learn the material.

Didn't really appreciate what he did in the beginning of the semester but now I understand why and am truly grateful.

Unlike some of the CS professor, he's friendly and approachable.

People whoever don't want to make any effort and slack off but still hope to pass better not take his class.",343
golub,1,,CMSC351,"This guy's head is so far up his own ass that he can see out his mouth.

He has made 351 to fail you. This is one of those courses where you will have to come to his office hours or the TA's office hours if you want to actually learn anything. If you do show up for office hours, don't expect to get help for about an hour because EVERYBODY ELSE is also trying to get help. Good luck.

His slides are absolutely useless. For whatever reason, he does not post his written examples online. Make sure to take good notes. He will do examples in class on his fancy shmancy Tablet PC, but not post them afterwards.

He posts extra assignments and examples online, but again, he does not post solutions. Same deal with the homework: NO SOLUTIONS ARE POSTED EVER. This alone makes the course hell for the math illiterate. You want to learn from examples and build up your confidence, but you can't because you have NOTHING to work off of.

Exams are generally based off the homework and his ""thought questions,"" the extra problems he posts online without solutions. Don't expect any extra help with those exams because he doesn't post sample exams. (If he did, they probably would come without solutions. So useful.) Of course, how he expects you to master some of theses proofs after one or two examples is beyond me.

His exam grading policy is the worst. If you get a problem wrong, you will lose almost all the points if you don't lose them all. Don't expect points for effort. You can write out an elaborate proof and get maybe a couple of points for it.

And then his ""curving"" system...

Since he's all into his mathematics, he ""curves"" by dividing your exam grade by a decimal he magically calculated or pulled out of his ass which is now also his mouth. Now your simple arithmetic abilities should tell you this is an issue. If you got a 100 on the exam with a curve of .90, you'll enjoy an extra 11 points. If you're the unfortunate guy that only got say a 50 on the exam, you get a mere 5 extra points. So if you do well on an exam, you get an extra boost. If you're already failing, expect to be failing even more. The rich only get richer in his world.

This guy always talks about how he's ""clever"" yet he doesn't do a damn thing to endow his students with his ""clever""-ness. This guy is incompetent as a teacher. Just dodge him for your own sanity.",343
golub,1,?,CMSC351,"This is the worst professor ever

The book does not cover the material on the exams

The slides also do not cover the material on the exams

All of his posted examples are either half of the problem or very unclear and vague

All of the most important real work he does in class on a note pad for a few minutes but he never posts these notes online on the slides at all, instead he just assumes you get it

You are not allowed to study together on homeworks or use notes from online

This makes this class nearly impossible to study for

Overall, one of the worst experiences so far",343
golub,1,A-,,"He's enthusiastic about what he's teaching... but that doesn't make it less boring.

The course is for non majors...so don't expect coding. The hardest thing you'll do code wise is probably a basic cascading style sheet for an html page. 

You learn about email... and file transfers...and html...and spreadsheets...sound fun yet?

20% of the first test grade was on dates like when the first mac graphical os came out... or when the microsoft mouse came out... and the dates are one digit apart... things like that made this course ridiculous. 

I'd never take it again and never suggest it to a friend. ",343
golub,2,,," The first half of class is pretty easy. I am not great with computers, but I got an A on the first exam and the first 3 projects. Then things get harder, and his notes are not that helpful, so I just looked stuff up and didn't use his notes. 
In class, a good way to stay awake is to play GOLUB BINGO. 
Under the G, put ""blows his nose"". Under the O, put ""Tells a story about the inaugration"". 
Under the L, put ""Tells a story about an East German spy."" 
Under the U, put ""Talks about his sister, who is in law school."" 
Under the B, put ""Mentions the New York Times"". 
If you get all 5 in one class, you WIN GOLUB BINGO! YEAH!!
Note: You may win very, very often.",343
golub,2,A-,CMSC351,"Oh Golub...

His lecture notes aren't the best in the world. He'll show how to do a proof on his Tablet PC...but not post those notes online. Sure it discourages the class-skippers but what about those who actually take notes and need to review them? He might have the occasional ""generic"" proof posted online but thats about it.

His exams are painful but doable. The biggest thing is reviewing all those homework/thought questions he gives and manipulating them. Practice practice practice!

One of Golub's bright spots: He'll happily answer ""any"" questions in class. If you missed something in the examples he does, he'll gladly go over it again until you get it. Please don't be asking ""what-ifs"". He often cut you off.

He does curve the exams. Often it's drop a question and add a few points.

With the final exam, he'll give you about 12 questions and you only have to do 8 of them. They are grouped into sections...like a section of three questions, a section of two questions, etc.

Overall Golub does know his material very well..but he's quite arrogant about it. He can be helpful but his teaching methods are questionable.

And yes, he doesn't give much partial credit.",343
golub,1,,,"If you're a journalism major and do not know a whole lot about computers, do not take this class with Golub. The lectures are boring, his notes are awful, and overall he is an absolute nut job.",343
golub,1,A,,"He is probably the most boring lecturer I ever had. He cannot teach at all and just so painfully boring. If you take the class with him, you better be good at UNIX. 
That being said the class itself was pretty easy for me. I am an Electrical Engineering major and I found this to be the easiest class I have ever taken through out my academic career. I got above 100's on all 8 projects with curve/extra credit. Exams were really long and was not able to finish in 45 minutes, but he curved them anyway. The final for the class was the easiest test I have ever had. It was all html coding/trivial question about html and I found it really easy. I even finished it in 15 minutes and got above a 100.
On the other hand a lot of other people found the class hard because they never was exposed programming or not used to UNIX. But if your some one like me and your in engineering you probably will find this class really really easy. ",343
golub,1,,CMSC351,"As bad as the CS department professors are I would say Golub is the worst. 

To start, his lecture notes are very bad. He hand writes his lecture notes on his tablet PC during lecture and says these will be online. The bad thing is that he works through a problem in class and doesn't put that work online. This is no help at all.

He post thought questions which are supposed to be sample like questions but he posts no answers or ideas about how to go about approaching them. You never really know for sure if you are even close to getting the right answer.

His exams are extremely hard. He does not have sample exams because as he says at the beginning semester ""He never really thought they were helpful"". Are you kidding??? If a question is worth 20 points you will only receive around 4 points for work if you are wrong. 

There is so much more to say about this guys teaching that is bad. The sad thing is that in the past 4 or 5 semesters he is the only professor teaching 351 during the fall and spring so you are pretty much forced to take him. I think it is better to take this class during the summer with someone else in my opinion!!!!",343
golub,2,,CMSC351,"As previously stated, Golub isn't the greatest professor the CS department has to offer, more like one of the worst I've had.  

As others said, he knows the material, but you never will.  Algorithms aren't for everyone, but he will make you regret taking the class in the first place.

His notes are USELESS, and I mean utterly, supremely pointless.  He will give examples in class that are on the slides, yet he leaves out the actual answer.  He uses a tablet PC to do most of the lectures, writing in the answers to questions as he goes along.  He fails to keep those handwritten items in what he posts.  

His homeworks are difficult and you really have to take them head-first.  He doesn't post any practice exams, etc... NO answers posted to HW's, NO answers posted to his ""thought questions"", NOTHING.  So if you don't go to lecture, you will have no reference as to how to do the work.

Despite all of this, office hours with him help a lot, but he still doesn't want to give you the answers to anything.",343
golub,3,B,,"I would have had an A if i hadn't screwed up submitting one of the projects. This class is not easy if you are unfamiliar with Unix and have no real computer background. I found myself trying to do a simple command for hours. His project directions are extremely vague. I am a journalism major and took this class thinking it would be easy. Definitely DO NOT take this class with Golub if your looking for an easy A. A's are possible, but not fun to get. Lectures are boring as hell and are mandatory for good grade because of clickers. Overall he is nice, but just a bad teacher. ",343
golub,2,B,,"Golub is a terrible lecturer who is extremely hard to follow. The first few weeks of lecture youll learn that taking notes is impossible and pointless (he posts notes online.) Going to lecture is pretty much pointless except to get attendance points via clickers, afterwards you would be best served to leave. The class consists of three exams which are 15 percent of your grade, 7 projects all worth 3-7 percent, attendance/scheduled in class discussions, and one monster of a final exam worth 27 percent. The projects are just step by step instructions that take anywhere from 1-3 hours. You work with UNIX command lines (yes, in an intro class), HTML code, spreadsheets, and a few other things. the exams are pretty tough, but if you study you can definitely pull off a B. Im pretty good with computers and had experience with HTML, but the class was still confusing. Had to take this for journalism requirements, but avoid it if you can.",343
golub,4,,CMSC351,"His lectures are okay, but his examples can be a bit hard to follow.  It's not difficult to do well in his class, but some of his exam questions are overly difficult and can be vague in terms of what he is really asking.  No quizzes.  Were assigned eight homeworks throughout the semester.  Homeworks aren't too bad and are actually useful as a couple of homework questions were asked to me in job interviews.  He is very helpful during office hours and will go out of your way to explain things to you before and after class.  Make sure to do all of his ""thought questions"" and alter some of his homework questions to study for his exams.",343
golub,2,,CMSC351,"Golub is a guy who seems to mean well, but his flaws are pretty serious. For one his grading methodology is questionable at best. If you read the syllabus he claims to curve each assignment...but his curving method is random and mathematically suspect. For example, on one exam we were told to divide our scores by .8. The problem with this curve is it gives MORE of a curve to people with higher grades...seeming to violate the point of a curve. Another time he gave everyone in the class 5 extra points as a ""curve"" but admitted that he had not yet calculated the average. He will intermittently claim that he has to ""recheck his formulas for final grades""...so basically he leaves your grade as one of his thought questions. I  finished the final for class yesterday, so the final grades aren't up yet, but it will be interesting to see what he does. I know kids who are brilliant and  very knowledgeable about the material who currently have Bs.

Then there are the exams which give little to no partial credit, and somehow expect you to answer questions based on information that he doesn't give you. For example, when he says ""use the quantified definition"" somehow in Golub-speak this means ""use the quantified definition using an inductive proof""...the later part being a crucial piece of information I wish I had.

His class is set up like a discussion. He gives you limited notes, and then you work out the details in class. This looks good on paper...but the problem is all those damn smart-ass CS kids who want to show off instead of letting everyone else learn. They'll derail him and let him think he can gloss over the details because everyone gets it already. Don't let him get away with this, shy people! Also, because his notes were so sparse and I'm a bad note-taker, I was affected negatively by his teaching style, but not everyone will have a problem with this.

If you want to do well in this class, you HAVE to come to class. His notes aren't going to help you. Trust me, come to this one. Also, see him in office hours if you can. This is kind of irritating to me, because this isn't feasible for everyone, but unless you have prior knowledge of the material, you're going to want to get extra hours with him to clarify some of his vague details (especially towards the end of the semester when the algorithms get weirder). Ask questions in class! He's more than happy to answer them. Also, submit regrades even if you have the slightest question about your exam. He will sometimes expect answers for questions he doesn't ask, and you can get those points back easily...once I got an exam bumped up a full letter grade because of this. He can be very stubborn about some things though...I know one student who had a log base 3 in one of his answers which golub argued with him for at least 5 minutes over whether it was a 2 or 3. ",343

golub,1,A-,,"He clearly knows the material very well, but is terrible at teaching it.  Lectures are painstakingly boring, so try to bring a laptop and stay awake, though almost no one will attend.  You can definitely get an A in the class, but it is not fun and you will not walk out with any practical knowledge.",343
golub,3,A,CMSC351,"People really scared me into thinking Golub was a terrible professor. I don't think he is really that bad. However, you will need to goto his office hours if you don't understand something and make sure you practice the material. He is sometimes overly tough, but generally fair. For example for the first test this semester he gave us decimals and fractions all over the place. It was really just a pain in the ass more than a test of knowledge.

However, he is a competent though not excellent teacher, and is more than happy to help you out during office hours.

That said though, he is not the sort of guy who will bump you up if he sees you in his office a lot or w.e. He will give you what you earn and nothing more.

That said, I abused notes from the previous semester with Bonnie/Vibha's sections because Golub just has garbage for notes sometimes.

So, pro tip: look at Fall 07 section notes :)",343
golub,2,,CMSC351,"Golub does not really aim to prepare you in lecture for exams or homeworks.  After the first midterm I found myself ignoring his lecture notes and working entirely off of the other section's (taught by Bonnie Dorr and Vihba) posted notes.  Golub was also indeed stingy with grading, and people in the other section could get points back on midterms that our section could not get back via Golub.  I rather wish I had been in the Bonnie/Vihba section.",343
golub,5,B,CMSC351,"Taught me all I needed to know, he had no surprises on his tests and was a great resource when I had concerns about my grade. I failed the first test (like 20%), studied my butt off for the next 2 and the final and ended up with a B.",343
golub,4,,CMSC434,"Golub is, well, Golub. This class is fun, but he can really make things serious about the designs and implementations. Design mocks required hours of effort (in a team), but were kinda satisfying in the end. It's a pretty chill class, but I don't recommend skipping too many classes - he seems to love random pop quizzes. Tests were pretty much right off the slides, and the homeworks were just 1-2 page question and answer things. If you take this course, be prepared to spend some time out of class for the project. Designing something in Android can take hours to make look pretty. ",343
golub,1,C,CMSC131,"I had him for 131 and did not learn a single thing except how is made world a better place, how is a influential person in many things. He should not be teaching 131 at all. This class needs a person who actually teaches.  ",343

Lectures were still boring but they were informative. Project descriptions were extremely well organized. In 434 there is a big group project. If you follow all of his directions, you should get a good grade in class. ",343
golub,3,A,CMSC351,"Golub talks a lot during lecture without having a lot of information on the slides themselves. The most crucial information you will learn is what he writes down during class. However, he will not post those notes online, so you can't miss any classes. If you show up to class and take down his notes, you will most likely be successful. Every once in a while, he will post example solutions on the course website - take advantage of them because he will most likely ask a similar question on his midterms. He has many homework and practice questions, but never posts the answers. So make sure that you compare answers with other people before the midterms. Study groups are key since you will never be provided with homework answers. If you go over every practice question and every homework, you will be adequately prepared for the midterms. The midterms are simple compared to the practice questions - just make sure you read the instructions carefully because Golub often asks that you only set up the question and not solve it. He isn't the greatest lecturer, but he will teach you enough to succeed in your class.",343

His slides are not that great when he has them, so you really have to pay attention. Despite these complaints I did learn stuff in his lecturers and I think I got the correct grades for the amount of work I put in. For 351 he was great mainly because he was much easier than Kruskal. His tests were very fair in that class and were very similar to the homeworks and lectures. I would recommend Golub for upper level courses, but maybe avoid him for earlier courses, as his non-sequiturs can be really frustrating when you are first learning certain concepts.  ",343
golub,3,A,CMSC131,"He's a good person, but an okay teacher. He lectures every class, but rarely stays on topic. If you know basic Java already you are probably better off taking his class because it will be so easy and minimal work. He does clickers, but it is really just for attendance.

However, the professor spent a lot of time going on tangents, so at some points it took us a long time to get through the material, or it was hard to pay attention to it. The projects themselves were fun, but I think they were somewhat repetitive.

Golub is very engaged in the course and answers questions quickly but his assignment descriptions are vague and because of that, he grades harshly if he feels like a group/student did not follow what he wants (even though it wasn't really specified in the description.) If you go over the Panopto lectures (which are divided into small video sections) and work well as a team, you should be fine. Ask Golub questions if you are doubting anything because of his description vagueness.",343
golub,3,A,CMSC434,"I had Professor Golub for CMSC434. The biggest weakness from the course is the lack of directions and the grading. A lot of the assignments that are given have very vague instructions, so it can be frustrating to see the feedback when you never knew that you were suppose to include something. However, the class is not really that difficult. The most important thing is making sure that you have a good group because a majority of your grade will rely on the assignments that you complete as a team. I would recommend to take this class in the same section as a few of your friends so that you will at least know who you are working with and that they will contribute equally.",343

golub,1,,CMSC434,"Was thinking this would be a fun course to take during my last semester as the thought of working on 1 single large project sounded fun, I was wrong. Lectures are very clear, everything else isn't really much so. 
The course has very vague descriptions of what was to be expected of the student and when grades are released, there is generally no explanation as to why points were removed. You end up not being to fight for points back since there no rubric. You essentially either did what he wanted or didn't, but he didn't tell you, so hopefully you guessed right. The assignments are graded based off personal bias and any attempts to put a creative twist leads to point reduction. I don't understand how a interface design class could be so close minded. Concepts can be applied in different ways. Considering all the concepts taught from lecture, he really need to redesign the course project and assignment descriptions and grading system as I'd rate them as a level 4 on severity because their catastrophic problems.

His quizzes, homeworks, and exams are incredibly fair and with a good amount of studying, doing well in the class shouldn't be an issue. CMSC250 is traditionally known as one of the weedout courses, but with Fawzi it never seemed like one.

1. Fawzi can't review every topic with a fine tooth comb because it's only a semester-long course, therefore the rate at which new material is introduced is fast. You will have to attend pretty much every lecture if you want to be at a good pace, and you must take copious notes - Fawzi doesn't use the textbook (don't buy the textbook, it's completely useless). 

2. The projects. The first two projects are very easy and doable...however the difficulty then increases quickly. PROJECTS ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GETTING A GOOD GRADE!!! The biggest problem students have with the projects is not figuring out what to do...it's actually completing the project on time. Fawzi gives you about a week and a half to do the projects, but most people wait till the last minute and their grade suffers mightily. PLEASE START YOUR PROJECTS EARLY. I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. 

Now that I'm done addressing those who might be new to programming entirely, let me broaden my view to everyone taking the class. Fawzi's tests are perfectly fair. Not too easy, but definitely not hard as well. Study well, and you'll do fine. PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE STUDY QUESTIONS. They're the keys to a good test score. Quizes and Labs count for a small portion of your overall grade, but make sure you don't BS them. Fawzi's Final Exam was definitely tougher than both his midterms, so don't blow that off and make sure you study hard for that one. 

Fawzi is a fantastic professor and I can't imagine any professor better in the CS Department who is better. ",344
emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC131,"Incredible professor. Teaches everything himself; never need to buy or look at the book (nor will it help you to). Take good notes in class; they are your only source of substantial information because truth be told, the online lecture slides (which are written by another professor anyway) are convoluted and give much extraneous information. Do not skip exams (as obvious as it sounds, it happens) or quizzes because he strictly adheres to university policy and will give you a zero. You can get by with showing up late but if you try and leave lecture early he will stop you and  make you feel terrible in front of the entire class. Start projects early (especially those toward the end of the course) since nobody can get it perfect the first time. Review the study questions he puts online, they mirror key questions on the exams.

I came into this class a Business major with no computer programming experience whatsoever, but he goes out of his way to make sure that everyone understands the material.",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC132,"Fawzi is the best natural teacher I've ever seen in my life!  If you go to the lectures you will learn the material.  Period. He's also pretty entertaining and tries to keep things informal and low-key. If you see a few ""mixed reviews"" on sites like this, let me tell you why: Fawzi has a very low tolerance for students who are obnoxious during class. If you act like an ass during the lecture, he will shut you down!  It's pretty funny to watch. So you'll find a few negative reviews from some of those people. But trust me, Fawzi is the best instructor you could possibly get. I'll take him for any course I can.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,"This guy is brisk, jovial, relaxed, and accessible. Most lectures are teeming with material, but he somehow makes it all digestible and light. Thing is, some of the topics (like data structures) won't stick to your mind in just one lecture; so you must re-read the slides, draw memory diagrams, and then explain them to yourself until you're comfortable enough.

The projects are appropriate for the subject matter and most of them have their easy or advanced sections already implemented so you can focus only on the stuff you need practice on.

Quizzes and exams are all easy as long as you go through the slides and maybe some of the example code. The discussion exercises are seldom helpful, but good for collaboration.

I got an A+ and the class is my favorite (most informative) CS class yet.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC122,"Fawzi was a great professor. Anyone saying he taught poorly probably just doesn't like Computer Science, not Fawzi. I don't know how you can make a computer class anymore simple or interesting. The TA's and his own office hours were extremely helpful for the projects. The tests and quizzes were straight from the lecture slides so if you go to class and then review them as study material you will get an A; the final is no exception. 

I had fun in this class and am now going to declare a Computer Science minor",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC122,"Programming is not really my thing, but Fawzi made the class more than bearable. His sense of humor and teaching style were very amusing and overall this was a great class. He grades reasonably, and the assignments were mostly pretty cool (except for one of them that drove me up a wall.) BTW, I thoght I was getting a C, but ended up with a B! Fawzi is more than fair when it comes to grades.

Somebody else said Fawzi wasn't helpful in office hours, but that's total B.S. I don't know why that kid is so pissed off - Fawzi knows the material backwards and forwards and will go out of his way to make sure you understand it. I got a lot of help in office hours from Fawzi -- he was totally chill.",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC122,"The class was fun!  Fawzi is truly a gifted instructor and does a great job making sure that everyone learns the material.  I met with him several times during office hours and he was very personable and helpful.  

The exams were very fair (actually, they were pretty easy).  The projects were reasonable, but don't start working on them at the last minute because office hours get crowded on the day the projects are due.

This is a course for beginners, so you don't need to know anything beforehand.  But be prepared to do some work. The projects take a good amount of time and there are frequent quizzes that you'll need to study for.

Overall, this was a great class for me -- I learned a lot and enjoyed it quite a bit.",344
emad_fawzi,4,A,CMSC122,"This class consisted of 2 midterms, the final, 10 quizzes, 5 programming projects, and an 8 page paper. The paper sounds bad but it's easy, basically if you do it and it's coherent, you should get an A. 

The class is easy in the beginning, until you start talking about Javascript. However, I ended up getting an A in the class and I had no prior programming knowledge whatsoever. He tries to make lectures interesting and talk about things that could be useful and get you interested in computer programming, if you aren't already. 

The tests have at most three questions where you have to write programs, and the rest are short answers, so he tries to help out the people who might not be good at writing programs and functions.

Good class to take if you are willing to put in a little work for the A.",344
emad_fawzi,1,B,CMSC132,"He doesn't care about his students.
Don't take his class.
He knows his stuff, but expects his students to already know the content that he is there to teach about.
Worst professor I've had at Maryland by far
",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC122,I'm finishing up CMSC122 with Mr. Emad this semester.  So far (as a second semester Freshman) this is the best class I've had in college. I'm actually changing my major to Computer Science as a result of my experiences in this course. Mr. Emad's teaching style is outstanding -- he is very enthusiastic and his explanations are always logical and easy to understand. The exams were reasonable (not too long and at the right level) and the projects were decent. I'm looking forward to taking CMSC131 with Mr. Emad this summer and continuing on in the major.,344
emad_fawzi,1,C,CMSC122,"1st: If you are a JOURNALISM MAJOR dont take this class with him.  and btw that expected grade is a C if he doesnt act like a complete douche.  He teaches 122 as if you already know coding and caters his class to people that will be majors or are trying to get into the major.  His grading is arbitrary and doesnt give you a rubric for the projects. Sketch. His grading is harsh, unforgiving and frankly unnecessary for an introductory class.  He doesnt curve, but takes off chunks of your grade for senseless things.  

He needs to think more about his audience, which is the key to being a good teacher.  Don't cater your class to people that already know material.  Bring everyone up or reconsider your profession

",344
emad_fawzi,2,B,CMSC132,"He is a great professor if you're smart. When I mean smart, I mean you know the material well, or pick it up while he's teaching. Everyday he comes to class he is disorganized but is a decent professor. He spends at least five mins per slide complaining about how the slides are wrong or not how he would have done it. The same with the coding examples you see on the CVS. He ASSUMES you remember almost everything from 131 but many friends of mine that tested or AP'ed (not sure how to say it) out of 131 have told me how much 132 sucks because he assumes you know more than you actually do. He is very meticulous with his grading and excessively strict. He is notorious for not curving the class so don't expect it. He curved for our first midterm (we had two) because the average was like a 65% percent. He told us that the exam was going to be easy, however many people didn't finish.

He's not for the average b student because he caters to the smarter crowd. Try to talk to him in person and tell me he isn't an self absorbed asshole. He invites questions but will sometimes ignore simple questions he assumes we should already know. He is rude and even if the TA's agree with you that one of his exam questions are unfair he will debate it to no end until you give up and realize it's impossible to convince him otherwise.

Don't get me wrong, he's not a bad professor and I would even recommend taking him as a professor. I just think he's an asshole.

Remember, he caters to the smart.He's a decent, but not the best, professor. The only reason I had an 85% was cause I know how to program decently even though I failed one exam. 

He's good in the sense that he expects alot from you and in turn you work harder because he doesn't curve. He's tough but not horrible.",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC132,"I enjoyed this class a lot from the academic perspective. I have seen him cut students short as is being argued below, but he needs to do so to teach all of the material, and when he does realize he had not heard someone's idea or question through that he should have, he will immediately apologize. He is confident but he does not devalue his student's ideas. In fact he encourages it, and I am confused by comments to the contrary.

I may be biased since I had few difficulties understanding the actual material; however, I am new to programming, and did do a lot of work outside the class to keep my grade up and be able to ask suitable questions. Some students asked questions that they should ask during office hours. I have taken advantage of this in the past and he is very thorough at explaining things as long as other students' time is not being completely wasted.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,"Fawzi rocks!  The reviews by the angry student below do not represent my views at all. Fawzi's lectures are thorough and clear, his exams are fair, and he has a great sense of humor.  I actually looked forward to going to his lectures! In office hours he isn't going to debug your code for you, but he'll give you enough hints to get you going if you're stuck.  I thought his exam reviews were extremely helpful -- he went over everything that we asked him to in great detail. The exams looked exactly like what he had prepared us for.  He really seems to care about teaching and I'll take any class with him that I can.",344
emad_fawzi,2,D,CMSC132,"The guy is awful and you are not a great programmer.  Everyone who has not gone to his office, loves him.  Everyone who has seen him personally, thinks he is a world class douche.  I will admit, I am spiteful now because he gave me a D for being less than a point away from a 70 (did bad on the final, was doing well until I took it).  I asked him for something, anything to make up the small difference and not screw me for the next year, but he said it wasn't his problem and that was all.  If you are a natural programmer, take him.  If you need someone who is kind and willing to be nice behind the scenes as well, take ANYONE else.  I have found Golub, Nadua-Perez, Plane,much more approachable.  Fawzi really is a jerk if you are a guy who is a below average programmer.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,Fawzi was a great professor. He explained all the course material in a way that was easy to understand and retain. I took AP Comp Sci in high school and had no problem in this class. Those who dislike Fawzi must have either skipped class often or are not cut out to be Computer Scientists.,344
emad_fawzi,3,B,CMSC132,"Fawzi Emad is a good professor in the things that he does. However, he is not willing to adapt his style for students who do not learn from his particular style of teaching. He expects you to come to every class, and will tell you what to expect on exams and such only in class (he also teaches using slides).

 This is not unreasonable; however, for people who learn best by doing and have a hard time following lectures, this can be a problem. On the first midterm, there was a big portion of the grade that was not tested via a project beforehand which can be very problematic for kinesthetic learners.

He also does not offer review problems, or even a sheet listing things to study.
However, it should be noted that if you attend class, keep track of the general topics discussed, and take very brief notes, then go back and study slides before the exam, you can do very well. You MUST do these things to succeed, because Fawzi will often test on things that he mentioned once in class that are just historical facts and you won't find in the materials.

Also, pay attention to what appears on quizzes, because it is likely to reappear on exams.

Basically, I would say that if you know yourself to be a kinesthetic learner, avoid his class because it will be a struggle to go by his style of teaching, but it is possible to do well with some work outside your normal way of learning.",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC132,"Fawzi is an excellent professor.  Explains the material really nicely and keeps the lectures interesting.

Definitely disagree with the idea of him not caring about his students.  He takes time to answer all questions in class and is very thorough in doing so.  The idea of him not caring about his students is quite far from what it seems like in my class at least.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,I also disagree with the person two/three posts below...  I had Fawzi for both 131 and 132.  I can assure you that he always went out of his way to help us learn the material.  His classes are actually FUN and he is always upbeat and energetic.,344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"I disagree with the person one below me. Fawzi is a really nice guy, and he does care about students. You'll find that out if you go to his office for help. 
He is definitely one of the best teachers in the CS department if not the best. Teaching people how to program isn't an easy task, and no one does it better than Fawzi. If you've never programmed before you'll have a hard time while taking cmsc131. It's because learning how to program for the first time is really hard, and you'll have to work extra hard in that class. He'll make sure that you learn all the material needed. He doesn't always write the exams, but he'll look at the exams and make sure there isn't anything that he didn't cover. When I took 131, he was running the class, and he wrote the exams, and the exams were very reasonable. On the other hand 132 was run by Nelson, and the exams weren't that great, but still fair.
Yes, CMSC389C (C++) didn't go that well, since it was the first time the class was being offered, and Fawzi tried to cover too much stuff in 3 weeks, which didn't work out so well. Fawzi hates curving, but he ended up doing a 10% curve in that class. Fawzi cares about his students, and he'll definitely straighten out that class the next time he takes it.
Fawzi has recently started to teach from slides, since he has some physical issues from writing on the blackboard for a long time, and his doctor told him not to write on blackboard. This is kind of unfortunate.
He is not like one of those dorky CS professors, he's a very fun guy.
On response to the reviewer one below me. Fawzi is a human being. He'll only get angry when there's a very good reason to be angry. One time a student was asking Fawzi if he could gchat with him over the weekend if he has any questions!!! You expect your professor to sit in front of his computer all weekend so that he can answer students' questions! Now who wouldn't get angry at that?
I took 4 classes with Fawzi. And I would never take a class with anyone else if Fawzi's teaching it.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC122,"Let me begin by saying that CMSC122 is probably one of the most demanding CORE classes out there, and you should take it only if you're willing to LEARN something (not a class where you can beat around the bush and get an A). With that said, Dr. Emad makes the rigorous challenge of learning a programming language for the first time insanely fun. He's a great guy, and overall a professor that can actually TEACH. I usually suck at programming, but because of his guidance, I can actually program independently now. You will have to work your tail off in his class, but trust me, in the end it's the most accomplished feeling you'll ever have. Wish I actually majored in Compsci now, since he made everything seem so interesting! ",344
emad_fawzi,2,A,CMSC132,"Okay. I had this guy for 131 and 132. He's probably one of the better teachers in the department. He's a decent teacher. Not incredible. He is good at conveying the information, and you will learn the material pretty well. However, there are a few majors problems.
First off, I don't think he cares much about his students. He is really into himself, and if you get in his way he will stomp you into the ground. Yes, he will teach you what you need to know, but he makes it fairly obvious that he doesn't care much about the students, but more about the fact that his boss wants him to teach in a certain way. Everything usually needs to go the way that he wants it, otherwise he will get angry.
A big problem with his grading and tests is that he stresses trivial stupid points that don't have much to do with the class. Some of the tests will have not much concepts, but some stupid esoteric stuff about Java that does not really matter.
Another big problem was that he used lecture slides made by the department that he didn't like. He was always commenting on how the slides were wrong and stupid. Well, if he didn't like them, then he should make his own.

He's a little bit rude as well when it comes to dealing with students, and helps very little with actual exam preparation in the weeks before the final.
Overall, 131 and 132 aren't too bad. The projects take some time, but if you work hard you can get an A. You should probably take this guy over some of the other 131/2 professors, but you should know what to expect. He just isn't as great as everyone says he is.

By the way, I'm not one of those students who happened to have a bad encounter with Fawzi or anything. I did fine in the class and didn't have any personal issues with him. I'm just telling you what you need to know about this guy.
",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC122,"Very friendly and approachable person. Clearly passionate and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, he has apparently injured his clavicle from years of writing on the board, so he gave lectures from a PowerPoint. He seemed a little out of his comfort zone.

Nonetheless, great professor. If you know nothing of HTML, CSS, or Javascript he'll make sure you do by the end of the class! Always has office hours and always willing and able to address any concerns.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC250,"Fawzi was a great teacher. Fawzi sets his expectations at a reasonable level and then expects you to meet them, unlike many teachers that expect WAY too much and then curve. Curves always seem to add more stress to the class than necessary.

Fawzi always did a good job conveying his thoughts, and was also good at coming up with multiple ways to explain the same concept for people who were struggling.

Fair exams too. Don't expect much of a curve, but you shouldn't need it since he's fair.",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"Fawzi is an excellent professor. I went into his class not having any programming experience and I came out with a great foundation in Java.  He really enjoys teaching, so his enthusiasm made the class fun and interesting.  His grading is very fair and he is very helpful and personable.",344
emad_fawzi,3,B,,"I had Fawzi for both CMSC131 and CMSC132, and got A's in both classes, although both of my A's were very challenging and I worked hard to make sure I did well. If you are reading this page for 131 or 132, please take Fawzi's class. However, for an upper level class (meaning 250, 351, or in my experience 389C winter class) please do not take Fawzi unless it is necessary. He taught CMSC389C for the first time and threw so much material and difficult concepts at us in a 3 week winter class (without a TA or office hours), that half the class didn't finish the final project, and since the final project was so difficult and right at the time of the final exam (who gives a final exam for winter class?), the class average was horrendous as well. He was reluctant to curve, and even then it didn't make up for an extremely difficult class with very little allowance for people with no knowledge of C++. Hopefully he improves it in the future, but please take Nelson's winter class or someone else's class, trust me, you'll be better off.",344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC131,"Excellent teacher, obviously I'm not the only one with this opinion looking at others people's appraisals. He knows java in and out, explains everything you need to know about the upcoming projects and he's just a likable person. His great personality makes the class bearable. If you have to take CMSC131, try to take it with Fawzi.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,,"Fantastic. Explains concepts very well, with very good examples, is helpful at office hours, and very friendly and approachable. Not an easy A, but you will learn lots.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132H,"Fawzi is a great guy. Really nice and respectful to students and he understands students very well. He is very funny too and an interesting teacher. He will often start the class saying ""What the hell am I doing right now?"" or something like that because he will chat with students almost to the point that he forgets he has to teach. But don't worry, you will always get through all the material for the day and you will understand it well enough. Biggest recommendation: start the projects early. You will be amazed at how good you feel and the stuff you can do when you've already finished your CS project early.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC131,"Awesome professor. Makes sense of difficult concepts. Students of other professors always come in and sit in on his lecture because he is always a better teacher.

emad_fawzi,5,A,,"Fawzi is an excellent teacher. He won the teacher of the year award at the University of Maryland in 2006 and after taking his course I can definitely say he deserves this. Fawzi is one of the most helpful, interesting, and knowledgeable teachers at the University. If you get him as your teacher you will be very lucky because his teaching methods are exceptional and you will learn a lot. He is not an easy professor though and many of his tasks are quite challenging, but he does value hard work and effort. Fawzi deserves the  6 golden stars!!",344

emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"Fawzi really is a excellent teacher, definitely one of the best at UMD. He explains everything extremely well, providing concrete examples along with easy-to-understand explanations of the material.

If you can, definitely take a class with Fawzi.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"Had him for 131 and he is damn good. One of the best profs in the CS department.

However, there is a downside, in that if you don't know some level of programming before walking in, you will have trouble. This is partially because Fawzi does not curve extra to cope with kids who know code inside out and still take the class.

As his GPA spreads say, he is a tough professor, and curves pretty minimally, but in the end, he is a solid teacher. Regardless of the grade you get, you will know the material to a good extent.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,,"Fawzi is one of the greatest professors I have ever had.  He's the most friendly guy in the world and explains everything with great clarity.

Fantastic.",344

His class wasn't a walk in the park but it also wasn't made any more difficult than it had to be. Fawzi's exams were fair and he taught you what was necessary to understand the material you were expected to know. 
One problem was that the book required for 131 was not even mentioned once by Fawzi, I assume the only reason it's required was for the other professor's lecture and sections. Make sure that the text is going to be used before you buy it for this class. 
Also, Fawzi is a computer science advisor for non-freshmen, and he's really nice if you come in wanting to get advice about classes. He's just generally a cool guy.",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"Excellent professor, one of my favorites.  His lectures are interesting and he's a fun guy.  He does an excellent job explaining material and caters to the beginners in the class.  Will definitely be looking for him teaching other courses I need to take.",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"I took a class with Fawzi a few semesters ago, and he is still the best professor I've had. This was the first comp sci class I took at UMD, and he went into great detail about all subjects, while still keeping the class interesting. I went to just about every class (something I never do now) because I knew I'd learn a lot and have a fun time. Great guy, great teacher...if you have the option, take a class with him",344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,Fawzi's way of explaining the material really makes it stick. I'm not sure what it is. He just makes you see why a concept is useful or why it matters and the explains it in a logical manner. Everything just clicks. ,344

emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC131,Excellent lecturer! This was my favorite class to go to. The projects are interesting the exams were not too bad. Take that with a grain of salt since I have programmed before. He posts weekly study questions and those are the guide to acing the exams. ,344
emad_fawzi,5,,CMSC131,"Fantastic professor, he is very engaging and pretty funny. The course (CMSC131) covers a lot of ground, so things move very fast-paced, but Fawzi does a great job covering everything. Study Questions are great for exam preparation (but not sufficient alone). Projects are not too difficult but become increasingly more time-consuming as the semester progresses, thus starting early is a good idea. Exams are very fair, not too difficult, not too easy. Things that are passed by in lecture may show up on the exam, so it is a good idea to make it to every lecture and take detailed notes. Definitely practice writing chunks of code on paper if you are not used to it, those are usually the most difficult portions of the exams and you won't have a lot of time to think of how to go about the problem, so it's important to know your approach immediately. Do the labs, the code that you have to write in those often resemble the code problems on the exams. Fawzi is superb at explaining abstract concepts and their practicality. The class is not an ""easy A"", but if you put in the work then you should be fine and will certainly learn a lot. The man is good at his job.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"One of the best computer science instructors I have ever had. He is extremely organized, and is great at explaining new topics in lecture. He is enthusiastic when teaching and wants to see you succeed. I would prioritize signing up for his class over anyone else. ",344

emad_fawzi,5,B+,CMSC131,"Everything I want to say has already been said by all the 5-star ratings of Fawzi Emad! This man is an enthusiastic, organized, well-spoken professor who is passionate about whatever he teaches. Of course, if you don't put effort into reviewing concepts and doing the CS projects early, your grade will reflect that. 

I liked his teaching style. Very straightforward and to the point, plus his humor to enhance the learning environment. Fawzi is surely the way to go when deciding which professor to learn from! In fact, I'm taking him again for CMSC132 and CMSC250 this semester :)",344
emad_fawzi,3,B+,CMSC132,"Fawzi is a solid lecturer. He explains concepts extremely well and is generally very articulate and well-spoken. 
However that being said, his quizzes for CMSC132 are unnecessarily difficult and he's often rude and condescending if you approach him at office hours. ",344
emad_fawzi,2,,CMSC132,"This review gives 2 stars for his 132. (For his 250, it will be 4 stars.)
I take his 132 after reading reviews of his 131 here, and realize that his 132 is pretty hard. He delivers content a bit fast in class, while the materials he provides on the website are not good enough to study for quizzes and exams. His quiz drives me mad. If you take his 132, you'd better take notes carefully and make sure everything is covered.
On the other hand, I recommend his 250, it's much easier than his 132, cool and relaxing. 
By the way, he's really strict, just don't miss any assignment. I feel like he's not quite approachable.",344
emad_fawzi,4,B,CMSC132,"I had Fawzi for CMSC131 and CMSC132.

Pros: He is a really good lecturer that keeps students engaged and makes normally hard material easy to understand via great analogies, detailed examples, and in-class demonstrations.

Cons: Beware of pop quizzes. Also, there are instances of him giving difficult projects. Additionally, in his office hours, he tends to be a bit more condescending that what his lecturing style implies.

Overall, my experience in his class has been a positive one. You will definitely learn a lot from him. However, be prepared to put in a lot of work every day.",344
emad_fawzi,2,A-,CMSC132,"Yes, he's a good lecturer. He was horrible for 132 regardless. Incessant pop quizzes. Rude during office hours. Unfair exams. I've heard only good thing for his 131 class but don't drink the Kool-Aid: Fawzi isn't all that. ",344
emad_fawzi,1,B,CMSC132,132 with him was drastically different from 131. Pop quizzes were really difficult and he was kind of a douchebag in office hours.,344
emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC131,Great Lecturer,344
emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC131,"Trust these reviews. Fawzi knows how to teach CS to beginners unlike any other professor in the department. I came in with absolutely no knowledge of Java and got an A+. By no means is his 131 class easy, conversely it is actually very difficult. I am a business major adding CS and this was definitely the hardest class I've ever taken. You need to work really hard and study literally every day to do well in this course. Fawzi is an astounding lecturer and if you sit in the front, ask questions, and take notes on everything he says, you can do well. Fawzi is miles better than any other professor (including Nelson/Pedram) for CMSC131. Take  him!",344
emad_fawzi,3,,CMSC131,"Fawzi is pretty overrated. Maybe it's just me since everyone else seems to love him, but he was under-prepared for class almost every single lecture. Maybe its because I was his first class of the day, not entirely sure, but he'd frequently forget about slides or not have materials ready. His lecturing style was alright, but nowhere near as phenomenal as people make it out to be.",344
emad_fawzi,2,,CMSC132,"I had Fawzi for both CMSC 131 and 132. I felt that his class for 131 was far better planned and overall the projects and exams were fair. However, for 132 his quizzes were a disaster, his teaching got more confusing, and whenever students approached him in office hours he was extremely rude. Honestly the most overhyped CS professor at UMD ",344
emad_fawzi,5,A-,CMSC131,"Fawzi is AMAZING! I don't see how anybody could give him a negative review. He is a true professional who loves teaching and cares deeply about his students. He's the best natural ""teacher"" I've ever had (including college and high school). The lectures were informative and held my attention the whole time. He was also very helpful and encouraging to me during office hours.  I wish I could take another class with Fawzi!",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC250,"Fawzi is an amazing proffesor, one of the best in CMSC. He makes topics that could be really hard as easy as possible. Homework always fits well with the exams. Warning that he has a dry sense of humor so if you're not prepared for it you might think he's making fun of you. Hilarious and cares about his students.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"I was worried taking this class with basically no cs experience, but fawzi definitely made everything feel doable. His lectures are great and because of the way his slides are made, you HAVE to attend every lecture if you don’t have a strong background. His quizzes are also very easy but he doesn’t drop so you have to make sure you go to every lecture and consistently stay up to date with his study questions. The two midterms are almost entirely straightforward questions and are very simple to study for by looking at past quizzes/study questions. The projects are easy A’s if you start them the day you’re assigned, which I made a habit.

Overall, this class was the most time consuming class I’ve had so far, but also one where I learned the most. I definitely recommend taking fawzi, as I believe you’ll learn the most from him.",344
emad_fawzi,1,A,CMSC132,"Fawzi is a good lecturer. I will give him credit in that he is able to present the material clearly and in a way you will understand. However, as a human being, he is very rude. He constantly is making comments to make himself sound so much better than you. He is rude in office hours about your concerns. I felt as though he did not take the time to feel the concerns or engage with the students. There were plenty of comments he made in class that left me feeling offended or upset. That being said, if you do not care about personality, he teaches well. If you want to have a good relationship with a professor, or are the kind of person who needs office hours with a professor, don't take his class.",344
emad_fawzi,3,P,CMSC132,"Fawzi is a pretty solid lecturer for beginners and his exams are pretty fair. He is open to explaining any conceptual problems you have about what he's teaching (as long as you're willing to wait in the long line for him). 
However, his quizzes and some of his later projects can be much more difficult than how he formatted them in CMSC131. Specifically for the quizzes, some of them seemed straight up unfair (considering the resources his class provided and the content we had covered). 

I would say that his CMSC132 class is doable, but be prepared for the spike in difficulty transitioning from his CMSC131 class.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"AMAZING professor. Clearly always prepared for his lectures, makes everything understandable and attention-holding, and easy to talk to. Great class even if you haven't done CS before. Overall, I had a great time in his classes (took CMSC131 and 132 with him). Projects are doable and interesting but will take time. He also has pop quizzes (better in 131 than 132 there). I learned so much from him!!",344
emad_fawzi,5,B+,CMSC132,"Fawzi is the best! He knows the material inside and out. If you watch his lectures, you'll understand everything. He's really good at explaining even the most difficult concepts. He's also a fun person with a great sense of humor that he uses to make the class even more enjoyable. I get the feeling he has a low tolerance for ""whiners"", which might explain some of the lower ratings.  Lol",344
emad_fawzi,5,A-,CMSC132,"I had Fawzi for both 131 and 132. He's definitely the professor you want for either of these, if you really want to learn the material. His lectures are easy to follow and he makes the class interesting and fun. He's also very friendly outside of class. I went to his office about 6 times and he was always welcoming and helpful.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,"Had him for 132 in Spring 2020 and I couldn't recommend him more. Some other reviews say he's rude but I never got that vibe from him. In fact, he's one of the kindest and most humble professors I've had. He genuinely cares about his students. If you have to choose a prof to take online, I'd recommend Fawzi. He handled the transition to online learning very well.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A+,CMSC131,"Such an awesome teacher for 131 and 132. He's fun and fair, and he's a good lecturer that makes sure you understand the material–as long as you pay attention during his lectures and show up, you can do really well in the class.

He also let me take my first 131 exam in his office after I accidentally slept through it, so I pretty much owe this man my life.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"The actual GOAT. I have minimal background programming experience and took this class to see if I enjoyed CS. Fawzi was a great professor with a great sense of humor and very fair exams/quizzes. He taught me so much about CS and I am very glad I took it with him, plan on taking 132 with him next semester to. If you can, take Fawzi.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"Really enjoyed his class - though lectures were recorded online, I was never bored when watching them, plus he makes the content really easy to understand for a beginner CS course; plus, quizzes + projects were not bad - would definitely reccommend!",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"Fawzi was a solid professor with quality lectures and enjoyable, reasonable projects. His lectures were asynchronous and you had all day to watch them, which was convenient. If you enjoy challenges, then I guarantee you will like his Soldiers project which was a lot of fun to work with. The biggest downside is that his quizzes are little tough and can be tight on time. He also comes off a bit rude in his class-wide emails, however whenever I personally emailed him, he was receptive and kind.",344
emad_fawzi,5,A-,CMSC131,"He''s a great professor and all his lectures explain the concepts thoroughly. During COVID his lectures are recorded and it mandatory to watch for a grade. He posts them a day early.  His exams and quizzes are timed. He makes silly jokes in his lecture and overall, I definitely recommend him as a professor for this class. ",344
emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC131,"I took Fawzi for 131 and will be taking him again for 132 in the spring. He is a great lecturer, explaining concepts well and then illustrating them with examples. He also keeps them fairly entertaining (which is hard to do with pre-recorded lectures, I'm sure his in-person classes are even better). All of the projects were fairly straightforward and most of the time you end up with a cool final product.  If you watch all his lectures and study your lecture notes, you'll do fine on quizzes/exams. He covers everything that winds up on his tests in his lectures.
",344
emad_fawzi,5,C,CMSC131,I am a rising senior in CS and Fawzi is one of the best teachers that I have had alongside Teli. He explains the concepts well and is good at gauging what a freshman understands better than Yoon. You can't go wrong with taking him or Nelson. ,344

emad_fawzi,5,B,CMSC131,"His lectures (which were asynchronous) were always out in a timely manner, and when they weren't he would give you an extra two or three days to watch them.

Weekly Wednesday quizzes can be challenging but most of the time was on recent material.

emad_fawzi,5,A,CMSC132,Prof. Fawzi is super reasonable and super knowledgeable. I would choose him over Nelson again (although I hear Nelson is great too). I loved the projects and the lectures were always informative and easy to understand. The quizzes are challenging but not unreasonable.,344
saavedra,3,A-,BSCI161,Very strict when grading assignments. Don't take online.,345
katz_jonathan,4,A-,CMSC456,"I give Dr. Katz a 4 out of 5 because, all things considered, he was a pretty good professor in a lot of ways.

First of all, his lectures and the content of the course follow his textbook almost to the letter so you have something concrete that you can use to follow along with the course. That being said, I found the book to be a bit dry and ambiguous at certain points (especially the 3rd chapter) and it definitely took a lot of getting used to. Still, it's a pretty solid book (especially considering that it's the first proof based undergrad crypto textbook on the market) and Katz does a good job of following the content well.

Another of Katz's strengths is that he's VERY open to taking questions and will elegantly field even the dumbest possible questions you could ever imagine. In all seriousness though, he's always willing to take questions and clarify points. Given that crypto is a pretty comprehensive and complex subject this is very important and very helpful.

Now for (what I thought were) the not-so-good aspects of Katz's teaching style. For one thing, I personally found  that the way he communicated just wasn't very easy to learn from. It wasn't just that the course was hard either -- I found that even when Katz lectured on stuff that I already knew that the message he was trying to get across was vague and difficult to wrap one's head around. It's hard to explain -- that's just how I felt about his teaching style.

Also, I felt that his homeworks were a huge pain and didn't really help very much to get across the content of the course. Most of the questions were taken from the exercises in the book and they took FOREVER and were graded pretty (to be frank, VERY) harshly by the TA.

Overall, I recommend Katz for CMSC/MATH 456. I personally don't think he's the best lecturer out there but I learned a ton in his class and I know for a fact that you're going to learn a LOT more from him than you are from Fitzgerald or the other math crypto professor.",347
katz_jonathan,4,C,CMSC456,"Professor: Seems like a great guy. He does his lectures on a whiteboard and doesn't post any notes online. As a whole his lectures are good and worth going too. He likes answering questions and will schedule a meeting with you if you need extra help (and ask for it). 

Coursework: We only had homework, the midterm, and the final. The homework's are challenging, are graded hard, and are a big part of your grade. I would recommend trying to team up with another person in class to work on them or to stop by the TA's office hours (I did neither). The midterm and the final were medium difficulty. He doesn't give any practice tests to study, so study the book and the book problems...hard.    

Grades: He does some kinda of curve with the homework's, not sure what. The midterm and the final cut offs might be changed depending on how the class did overall. No extra work or credit will be given, so study hard for the midterm and the final. If you do badly on either, you have a good chance of failing the class.   

Bottom Line? Don't underestimate the homework's or the tests and you can do well in this class. My C grade was due to a poor midterm grade and some of my poor homework grades. This is a great senior class because of the low workload (homework's are spaced around with one to two weeks breaks in between, and you only have two tests). But don't take this class if your the type that does badly on tests.",347
katz_jonathan,4,A,CMSC414,"Prof. Katz is a pretty good CS teacher. He teaches on the board and does not just read off of a powerpoint. The midterm was moderately difficult, but the final was in-class, online, all multiple choice and was easy.

Projects and homeworks were cool, but honestly there could have been more (assuming you actually liked the topics)

Biggest issue with this class is that 50% of the people come in with not a clue about any of the topics and with no security background and the other 50% has experience and knows a bit already. This makes the class either too easy/boring OR too hard/too fast. Can't make everyone happy, but this gap can make the class less enjoyable.",347
katz_jonathan,4,A,CMSC414,"He's on OK professor. I didn't really go to class because it was boring (not the prof's fault).  But he put up the slides online.  Exams are actually pretty easy but everyone does badly on them (trust me, I'm no genius).

The projects/homeworks are awesome and entertaining (best part of the class).  The course gives you a good overview of things, although a good 25% of the course seems common sense.",347
katz_jonathan,5,A+,CMSC451,"Textbook definition of a good professor.
- Answers Piazza posts quickly
- Lecture is clear, provides lots of examples
- Handled the transition to COVID online learning very well
- HW's were relevant
- Exams were reflective of HW's and class material

10/10 would take again.",347
katz_jonathan,2,B-,CMSC451,I would not take him again because he seems to genuinely not care about any of his students. He has good and interesting lectures but it seems like he doesn't want to spend a second of his time outside of class for the class. Maybe this impression is unique to me but I felt like he didn't care about the students and didn't want to be bothered. ,347
katz_jonathan,1,B,CMSC451,"He has good lectures but this person genuinely does not care about any of his students. He does not want to spend any second on logistics and his replies to piazza posts are very irritating to say the least. I would not take him again. And grades? He says everybody should get an A and does not curve. Grading is not clear at all! We never know what the cutoffs were, we never knew what grades we had until we saw them on Testudo. A complete failure of a professor in my opinion. He also asked if us so many times not to email him. He even said he will not respond to any emails. He genuinely does not want to teach in my opinion. ",347
papoian,4,A+,CHEM131,Dr. Papoian is a good teacher for what is usually a difficult class. His lectures are clear and helpful. He spends time going over quantitative problems and makes it clear what will be on the exam via practice exams. The exams are relatively easy compared to other 131 profs (esp. Friedman). The average overall grade for our class was 81.9.,348
papoian,3,A+,CHEM131,Dr. Papoian seems like the classic archetype of a professor who understands his material so well that he struggles to teach to people with little to no chemistry background. His lectures were unenlightening but he is a nice enough guy and the class isn't challenging if you just do your work.,348
papoian,2,,CHEM131S,Do not suggest taking him online by any means. ,348
papoian,3,B+,CHEM131,"The professor mostly went over the same topics we did as homework. Lectures were okay, not very interesting. The workload was by far the worst out of all my classes but its not too hard to get a decent grade, just VERY time consuming. Practice exams were NOTHING compared to the real exam so don't be fooled. Same concept but much more difficult problems. One of the exams ended up having a horrible class average (many 40s) and from many complaints, was curved at least 18 points.",348
papoian,3,B,CHEM131,He was an alright professor. I chose an asynchronous class and he recorded his lectures. I mainly used the textbook and CHEM101 homework to teach myself. I only used his lecture if I really didn't understand a concept but I only needed to do that once or twice. The class is manageable and the textbook was my main resource. The homework was reasonable and it really helped me in the end. He also is willing to work with students. My class did really bad overall on one test so he let everyone take the make-up but if we ended up with a worse score that would be our grade either way. I think he was better than the other teacher for the semester. Overall the class was fine.,348
papoian,3,B,CHEM131,"He understood what he was talking about and usually answered questions pretty well. Was not very helpful on the interactive textbook, which has a lot of glitches and answers key issues. Other than that his exams and homeworks are very similar to those in the past. DIfficult material for any freshman I think but if you study a lot you should be fine in his class. However, having him online and in-person are two very different things. Easier to get a good grade in person so I would wait to take his class until the apocalypse is over.",348
vanhoy,5,A+,CMSC435,Great professor and very reasonable. He even gives extra points for completing projects early. Highly recommend taking his courses.,352
borgia,2,B,BSCI465,"Short version: interesting class, terrible professor.

Long version: Let me start by saying that Dr. Borgia is completely competent in his knowledge of the material....HOWEVER -- Dr. Borgia is also probably one of the most boring and strange-to-look-at professors at the University. He won't see your hand raised unless you are sitting front and center (which I would recommend you do if you're planning to attend most of the lectures). He does this weird swallowing thing when he's been talking for a long time and it cuts off his words and you're sitting there staring at him trying to catch his breath....it's weird.

Anyway, his lectures consist of plain black and white powerpoint slides that he reads off of. 

Discussion points are worth the same amount as the FINAL EXAM, so you have to think of shit to say every week. It's terrible for someone like me who is quiet and generally unopinionated. The discussions are based on a weekly assigned scientific paper, so if you like reading lengthy scientific papers then go for it.

His exams are essentially 100 True/False  questions (multiple-multiple choice)and maybe a question or two where you graph the results of some experiment he talked about in class.

You're kinda damned if you do and damned if you don't attend lecture. If you do, you'll be literally bored to death (I nearly drew my last breath this semester) but if you don't go you won't get discussion points (which BTW seem to be very arbitrarily assigned; there didn't appear to be any particular organized method of evaluation) and you'll miss graphs and charts that he explains in class (AND THESE ARE USUALLY NOT ON THE LECTURE PPTs he posts online).

And while we're talking about powerpoints....can you say CLUSTER FUCK. I try to give the guy a break cuz he's damn near blind, but his powerpoints are the shittiest things I've ever seen in an institution of education. Why doesn't  he get an assistant to help him, geesh! So that's another incentive to attend class, cuz if you try to decipher that shit by yourself at home, you'll be so screwed.

Welp, have fun in class now, kids! :-D",353
borgia,2,C+,BSCI106,"Borgia is rather boring, I will admit, but that's not what makes his class kill you. His exams and quizzes are mostly true and false questions where he only changes one or two words in the definition to make it false. Sometimes, he'll have a question on the exam from a quiz, but the answer is different. His questions purposely try to trick the student - they aren't designed to test for actual knowledge at all. He also makes a LOT of errors, both in his powerpoint slides and on exams. It shows he could really care less about the class he teaches. He also only curves by the highest test score. One person gets a 96 and he curves by 4 points, despite the class average being a 66.

I agree with what someone else said - if you ask a question during lecture, he will answer quite brutally, almost rudely. There was one gentleman that obviously didn't quite believe in evolution and Borgia insulted his intelligence several times over. 

The lab isn't too bad. I had Dilip, who actually seems to care about how well you're doing and whether or not you understand the material.

---Edit---
I was furious with my grade. After checking and checking, apparently I ended up with a C. Out of 800 points, I was 1.5 points away from a B. I asked if it was possible to be bumped and the TA I was corresponding with (not Dilip) said Borgia didn't do that.",353
borgia,3,B,BSCI106,"This class was super boring but with almost no effort I got a B. If you're a bio major I would take this class with someone else where you'll probably learn more. There are quizzes every other lecture or so that really help your grade. He's a pretty okay guy, he does try to make jokes in lecture... Anyway if you have a good TA then your experience will be better. I had Katie and she was really great. Lab is where you learn most things but you do have to go to the forest which is by Lot 6 behind the Public Health Building. Also the last lab is at the stream which is by the View near Route 1. I have absolutely no interest in bio so this class was good for me because there was no book and by simply glancing over my notes I got C's on the test. The good thing about Borgia is he rounds from the highest grade to a 100 so my final exam grades were always Bs. I'm sure with a little more effort I could've gotten an A but what's done is done. The TA's are really helpful and there's opportunity for extra credit, through quizzez and the like, but it's only a few points so it won't make a big difference but if you're on the edge it will. Overall not a bad prof. but class is boring and it's not one you want to go to. He also pot notes and slides online and sometimes reuses exam questions. His tests are mostly true/false with one minor difference being false, there are fill in the blank, short answer, and matching.",353
borgia,1,A,BSCI106,Do not ever take him.  His true and fa1se questions in pop quizzes and tests are SOOOOOO hard and tricky.  His lectures are so boring that half of the people comes to lecture.  Also his lecture slides do not make sense because there are so much grammatical error. ,353
borgia,1,B,BSCI106,"Do not take him. You will learn nothing from his lectures and you'll end up teaching yourself the whole course. Not only is he rude, but he is extremely unhelpful. He doesn't care at ALL how much the students are learning or how the students do.",353
borgia,1,B,BSCI106,"AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS. He is by far the most boring professor I've ever had. His lectures are awful, boring, mono-tone and just confusing. He barely explains anything as he reads from his lecture notes through the whole class. His lecture notes that he puts up on elms have so many different errors. Just to sum it up, save yourself a huge dissapointment and many many headaches... 
DON'T TAKE HIM",353
borgia,1,C,BSCI106,"The content was impossible. I went to class and studied for an ABSURD amount of time for the exams, and I've only gotten a 65% and 55% on the midterms. The class average for the second exam was a D, which is absolutely ridiculous. I'm a mostly A, high B student. I have never once gotten a C in any class and I'm praying for a C in this class, which is ridiculous considering the amount of time I put into this class. The teacher is an idiot; he reads right off the slides. When I go back to his lecture slides to read the notes, he spells ""cells"" as ""sells"" and has so many grammatical errors that you cannot even understand the point he is trying to make. My TA wasn't even good. I emailed him 6 days before the exam to ask what we should study since there was no study guide given out and no specifications and he did not email me back until two days before the exam, only after I sent him a second email. He responded with ""I have no idea how to answer your question."" There was literally NOTHING enjoyable about this course and I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to take it. I'll admit that I am much more of an English/History student, but I've never been a bad student whatsoever and I'm praying that I do not need to retake this class. His exams are 60 True/False questions. True and false does not test your knowledge, but your test taking skills. He is not curving the class, but he should when his average on a test is a D, and a friend of mine who got an A in BSCI105 is struggling and worried about his grade. I wanted to take this course to be a Psychology major, but I'm dropping the major. Dr. Borgia is way to old to be an effective teacher- he cannot even see when his students have questions. He snaps at certain people and his TA's do the same thing. Even my TA would start a class beginning, ""If I don't make you fall asleep today, it has been a successful day."" In the middle of class he would say to himself, ""I love my job. I love my job."" While everyone else has had their quizzes back for weeks, I'm still waiting for my grade and they obviously will not be returned by the end of the semester. This class is 100% the worst class I have ever taken and will ever take through my college career. I am possibly taking it to the department, but I'm not sure what they can do about it.

Basically, DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. ",353
borgia,1,C+,BSCI106,"The teaching style is abysmal.  The powerpoints are fraught with typos, he lectures in a monotone, and even though he asks if there are questions, he never stops to actually see if there are any, and the TA has to intervene before he moves onto the next slide.  He goes through the lecture slides incredibly fast-- he reads straight from the slides, which he posts online a few hours after the lecture.  Going to class feels pointless, but he has 10 unannounced quizzes throughout the semester, so you need to go or else you'll most likely miss one.  

Exams are inordinately difficult: we have 2 midterms, both of which are half true/false, and remaining half consisting of fill in the blank, matching, and short answers.  The exams don't focus on overall concepts, but rather nit-picky details hidden in his disorganized lecture slides, which makes it VERY difficult to get a grade that matches the level of effort you put into studying for the exam.  He curves each test to the highest grade, which is nice since he isn't obliged to do that, but since there are only a few people with any A's at all, the majority of the class is still stuck in the C, low B range.  Also, don't waste money on the textbook; he says in the beginning of the year that you can to have some background information, but his tests are completely lecture-based, and it is a complete waste of money to buy the expensive text listed on the syllabus.

This class isn't the worst in the world; if you work your ass off, you can probably get a decent grade.  That having been said, if you can take the course with a different professor, I highly suggest you do so.",353
borgia,1,,BSCI106,"This guy is an awful teacher. He can barely see and can't read his lecture slides to us without getting an inch from the screen. On top of that, his exams come straight from lectures, and are so poorly worded that almost nobody does well, yet one person will get a 95 and wreck the curve for everyone. Avoid Him.",353
borgia,1,C,BSCI106,"This professor is the worst one I have ever had. I tried to read the reviews on here and decided to take a chance and take this class with him. Biggest mistake ever. I highly suggest you find another professor. His tests are confusing and most people get c's and d's on them, but since one person gets a 95 or above he only curves the test by 2-3 points.

Trust me, save your time/money and take it with a better professor. ",353
borgia,2,A-,BSCI106,"Borgia sucks. He is an extremely boring lecturer, he's really rude, and if you raise your hand he won't call on you cause he's basically blind. The class is real easy though. You have to go to class because of the 5 question clicker quizzes each lecture. The exams are all true/false and most of the questions come from the clicker quizzes. Don't buy the textbook or anything for this class besides the response card, everything comes from lecture.",353
borgia,1,B,BSCI106,"He is awful. rude, not very helpful, all he does is read the notes which you can do yourself.

also you dont need the book at all. all the notes are available online. 

the TA's basically teach this class ",353
borgia,3,B,BSCI106C,Ok so Borgia was one of the most boring lectures I have ever been to see.  He does these clicker questions that are eventually totaled up into an exam grade which sucked but the TAs in this class are amazing. Reimi was great and actually made lab pretty fun. ,353
borgia,3,A-,BSCI106,"First off try and get JF Savard as your TA (he is more than a grad student i think he said he was here to work for Maryland on their projects in Australia over the summer or something like that.  anyway he has TAed for BSCI106 like 7 times so he knows what he is doing)

As for Borgia he is really an ok guy.  There was one true/false midterm (but he changes the midterm type semester to semester i think) and a final.  There were also 5 clicker question points each class and those added up to one test grade. A lot of points in this class come from the lab, so that is why you want Savard.  

Borgia's lectures were pretty useless, but you had to go for the clickers... He just reads off a powerpoint that has many misspelled words.

He curves tests so that the highest grade gets bumped up to a 100 and everyone else gets bumped up the same amount of points.  ",353
borgia,2,,BSCI338R,"Stubborn, even rude at times.  Easier to talk to in his office than in class.

Lecture for fifteen minutes, rest of the class is discussion lead by a different pair of students each week.

If quiet or not very opinionated, class may seem dull and annoying as you try to find something to say each week.  Participation is part of your grade.

Turn in typed questions from the reading every week.  
One multiple-choice midterm, curved to highest grade.  Based on lectures (he posts them).  
One paper presenting a novel idea relating to Darwinian Medicine, or presenting different sides of a related topic.  
Presentation on last day to class on a different topic than paper.  

Readings from ""Why We Get Sick"" by Nesse & Williams, papers or articles.  Vary in length and difficulty.  

Would not recommend to friends.",353
borgia,2,B-,BSCI360,"TL;DR Don't take this class unless you want to really work for your grade. This is a 3 credit class but feels more like a 4 credit class


Fun class, but a terrible teacher. The exams are T/F and short answers and its almost impossible to finish in time. He expects you to understand his typoed notes and how his rambling stories are relevant to the lecture.

The discussions are pretty bad especially when he expects you to lead at least 2 discussions on scientific papers that are written for experts in the field. He grades kinda fairly just make sure you are on good terms with the TA though, my TA was a harsh grader so it made the class even more stressful",353
evans_michael,3,,AOSC123,"So signed up for this class cuz it looked like I'd get a better understanding of climate, yet it really seems like he expects you to already know the terminology, and how things work prior to coming to the class... VERY hard if you have zero understanding, probably VERY easy if you know the topic, but this should be a teaching class for an intro course not an affirmation of prior knowledge.

Sad cause it looked like it would be good.",356
evans_michael,3,A+,GEOL437,He is very average. A bit boring even though he tries to be exciting but he is very helpful and willing to spent time working with you until you understand a concept. He is also really nice but the class itself  was not particularly enjoyable. ,356
forni,2,B,MATH130,"Professor Forni is a really nice guy, but he can't teach very well. People rarely showed up for lectures. Also, the TAs sucked so much. They were terrible teachers too, and they gave us so little time for our quizzes the first several weeks. Exams are difficult, but if you consistently do the homework, you should be fine. You have to teach yourself math at this school anyways, the teachers usually suck",358
forni,4,A-,MATH130,"Professor Forni is a very nice man but is awful at teaching. He goes off on tangents during lectures and it is very difficult to keep up with him. I completely stopped going to lecture and just went to discussion instead. He has very nice and helpful TAs that understand the students. Forni's exams are impossible, I got a 43% on one exam but still managed to get an A- in the class. He curves very generously to compensate for his difficult exams. Overall awful professor but a good curve ",358
forni,1,,MATH220,He teach very fast and very confusing. He does curve the class alot but if you are a student who needs to know the material very well I would NOT recommend him at all!,358
forni,1,,MATH220,This is by far the worst professor i have ever meet in my life. Enough said.,358
forni,4,,MATH405,"Well, people below do make a quite-true comment on him. However, I have to say something else. Don't expect the teacher to teach you everything in the classroom, especially in the math class. If you don't do homework, don't read the text carefully, don't go to his office hour, then don't blame at last. I took MATH405 with him. I believe 405 is the most or second most difficult math class for undergrade(you guys can confirm this with anyone in math department or any students who have ever taken this class). His lecture is ""terrible"", full of abstract content and lots of stuff that presume you have already known. But, he is patient both in and out of classroom. You can bring your homework to his office, he will do every single one for you step by step. And he curve a lot, as long as you got a score above the average, you can guarantee to get a B. And usally, this B finally turns to an A- or even A on your transcrept, because he really CURVES a lot. 

Guys, don't blame how fxxxxxx bad the professor he is if you don't attend lecture, nor do homework. Blame yourselves, cuz you are students, you are supposed to be responsible for what you have ever done.

Last, I want to say, if you devote your time into it, you really learn a lot, far more than the course coverage, from him. He is knowledgable and smart. You know, he was a Ph.D. from Princeton U. xD",358
forni,1,A,MATH220,"After the first few days of class I thought I was really going to like this guy.  Unfortunately, those feelings haven't stayed the same due to the fact this guy just rambles on about derivatives without teaching.  Just to give you an idea how bad of a teacher he is, the class average for the first midterm was a 39.  He's arrogant in the fact that he expected people to get everything right on these tests when in reality, they were nearly impossible.  The only reason why I'm doing well in the class is because I took calculus last year.  I've talked to kids who didn't take calc and are in my class and they are completely lost.  There are so many other teachers you can take for this class.  I advise you NOT to take a class with Forni.",358
forni,1,A,STAT400,"What everyone else said.  His lectures were awful so I had to rely on my TA to learn the material.  Homeworks were pretty easy but do not prepare you for the tests at all.  Even though the tests are open book, the book doesn't help at all.  I failed my second midterm but still got an A because of the generous curve.  ",358
forni,1,A,STAT400,"His lectures are impossible to followw, so you must learn everything from the book. His tests are created to be IMPOSSIBLE! He himself said that a student should be able to only understand half the test. That sentiment was reflected in the average grades (the first midterm average was a ~45, and the second was a 32). The final was do-able. Avoid if possible.",358
forni,1,,STAT400,"Good lecturer: no, a terrible lecturer
Smart: may be but definitely not a smart teacher
Tests: hard, at least 2 problems not doable
Approachable: not really, sometimes didn't show up during his office hours
Should I take him: I suggest to do everything possible to AVOID taking any class (esp. STAT400) with him
Are lectures helpful: 95% of lectures that I attended were not very helpful, other 5%: don't know.
Test avg: Test 1 -> low-mid 50s, Test 2 -> low-mid 30s...I'm not kidding!!
Curve: Huge curve, basically if you do avg on test, its a B
Other comments: 
-If you have questions about homework, don't go and ask him. He  will do everything but answer your question. 
-Even though he is a stats professor, he won't give you a grade distribution which is sad




",358
forni,1,B+,STAT400,"Honestly, I went to no more than 25% of the lectures. From when I was there, I can say that Forni focused mostly on the theoretical concepts of the class. He showed us the proofs for many concepts in statistics. His lecture was not really organized well and he rarely did example problems. 
HW is 30% of the grade, which boosts your grade. I learned most of the general concepts by doing the homework and reading the not-so-well-written textbook. I knew the material well enough to do the practice tests that tested a basic understanding of the material.
However, HIS TESTS ARE HARD. The problems make you apply the material in ways that you have never seen (not in lecture or in the book). There is a huge curve, because even though I likely got below 50% on both midterms and the final, I still got a B+. 
Even with the curve, the class is just annoying, because the tests just stress you out and I didn't learn anything that I really couldn't have figured out from AP statistics. 
I would say AVOID HIM if you can.",358
forni,2,B,STAT400,"This man is a genius but a terrible teacher. The exams are open book but insanely difficult. He curves to a B average though which is cool and he is also very approachable and responds to emails fast.

Basically, he is terrible teacher but also a fair one.",358
forni,1,,STAT400,"Must have to agree with all poster below.  All he does in lectures are proofs.  I only went to majority of his lecture before exam 1 then i found out nothing in his lecture resembles on his exam.  HW was 30% of grade (grade booster), it was straight from the book.  All exams resembles NOTHING from HW or lecture.  He even told us to do practice exam from other prof in testbank....totally different.

He only had 4 problems on exam 1 & 2.  He even stated that the last 2 problems he makes it more difficult to see how we do...so he atleast expect a 50 from ppl

Exam 1...the average was around 50+
Exam 2...the average was around 30+

With those averages, he gotta curve...but if you hit the average and do really well on the HW....you should be fine...I manget to get a B with good HW scores but a little below average test score...

But if you really want to learn...he is not the prof for you...

",358
forni,1,,STAT400,"He is a terrible professor, he reads the book and does proofs the entire lecture. He assigns a lot of homework and it's 30% of your grade. The tests look nothing like the homework, nor do they resemble anything else he did during class. The average grade for the first test was a 55 and the average grade for the second wont be higher than a 45. DO NOT TAKE STAT400 WITH HIM. ",358
forni,3,B,STAT400,"Forni teaches stat400 in a very unique way. lectures are very confusing, and most people do not attend. the weekly homework from the book was pretty straight forward, but his tests are completely different and there are not any good tools to study for them. however, there is a large curve as a 50% on the 1st test was close to a B. it is not hard to pass the class, but the material is sometimes overwhelming. do not recommend for people who really want to know the material",358
forni,4,B,MATH411,"Prof. Forni is a nice and approachable guy. That being said, his lecture was kind of unorganized and through out the semester I had no idea what was going on. But he always appears so understanding and innocent that I just couldn't want to blame him for anything... Do not expect his class to engage you (in this class he assigns problems out of a boring book. I liked the problems he wrote but it only happened for the very first hw :/ ). Take his class if you are especially motivated/determined or you may slip off the way I did... 
Exams were hard, mostly because they were ~10% similar to the problems from the book... He did generously curve the average of the class final grade to a B (the raw average was failing).",358
forni,4,,MATH411,"He's a funny guy, really smart too. His lectures are ok, but you doesn't follow the textbook very strictly, so oftentimes I had no clue what was going on. His midterms are ridiculously hard, while the final is somewhat more reasonable. That said, he curves to a B average, which is pretty generous. His style of teaching is different from others, but the way his exams destroy your self-confidence gives you great perspective on how little you really know.",358
forni,1,,MATH411,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR

He is the worst professor I have had during my undergrad studies and he should not be teaching classes. His exams were totally unfair and unrelated to the material he was supposedly teaching and his teaching was totally incoherent. I made the mistake of taking this professor but I hope others avoid making this mistake. ",358
deming_leo,5,A,ASTR100,Professor Deming is amazing! His lectures are extremely thorough and it is very clear he loves the topic and wants to share his interests.

He does a lot to make sure you get the material,361

chadwick,5,A-,MATH141,The best choice for MATH140-141. His lectures consist of him working out some proofs and doing examples that relate to the WebAssign and his tests. His tests are pretty straight forward and not very hard since he posts his old test. Averages for the exams are around low to mid 80s. He also prepares you well for the final. I ended up getting a solid A on the final exam even though I got a few B's on his test. Overall just a nice guy to.,362
chadwick,5,B-,MATH141,Chadwick is easily the best Calc 2 teacher. He gives the easiest tests that are simply plug and chug (no theory or proofs). He gave our class a 3% curve as well on top of a semester with an abnormally high gpa average for Math141,362
chadwick,4,,MATH424,"Great professor. His exams were very close to his study guides and overall fair. The only complaint I have is that he created a effectively down curved the class by changing the weights on assignments more than half way into the semester. In addition, instead of dropping two assignments (which is what the original syllabus stated), he decided to drop just one.",362
chadwick,4,A-,MATH140,"Really good teacher. The lectures/notes flow easily to follow. Dr. Chadwick hand writes everything, and goes through problems and examples of what you are learning to make it easy to understand. Quizes and exams are fair, and accurately reflect what was learned in class. Discussion worksheets are more concept based, and not the most helpful, but the homework and lectures are where the main focus is. Only problem with Dr. Chadwick is that he is not good at answering questions DURING lecture. Go to his office hours (which are underused except before an exam) if you need help. Really chill/easy going teacher. ",362
chadwick,5,A-,MATH141,"Dr. Chadwick is a very thorough teacher. His lectures are all handwritten, and his example problems are very helpful for the homework. Exams and quizzes for his class are very fair, and cover whatever he reviews (no trick questions). Dr. Chadwick is still not able to answer questions during his lecture, but go to his office hours since hardly anyone does unless it is before an exam.

Discussions are helpful, but really depends on who your TA is.",362
chadwick,5,B+,MATH140,"Chadwick is a great teacher. With online lectures, he is very detailed which really helps you understand the material and units. He always allows students to stop him if they have any questions or if they're confused. I don't personally go to his office hours, I usually go to GSS which is a big help. His worksheets he assigns us during discussion with our TA are difficult. They're nothing compared to what you learn in lecture. Especially in the beginning, you literally don't understand why it's so hard. But overtime, it makes more sense and you get use to it. Quizzes every other-ish week, and they are very easy. Tests on the otherhand are much harder. But if you know the material and do practice, it's not hard to get over a 90. HW was given on WebAssign. He was nice enough to not assign hw on fridays, so hw was only twice a week. WebAssign kinda of sucks, but isn't that awful. Chadwick, great teacher, highly reccomend if you can get his class (they fill up very quickly)",362
chadwick,5,C+,MATH140,"I believe this class is one of the hardest classes that many undergraduates take. However, I would recommend taking this course with Dr. Chadwick. He was very detailed in his explanations of most of the concepts and would stop and answer any question during the lecture. I believe his demonstration of knowledge was what prepared many students for the exams. I'm not great at math, however I was able to do better than my expectations due to Chadwick. ",362

-He gives detailed lectures and reasonable amount of work. Just like CALC 1, its 2 HWs/ week, 2 WKSTs/ week, and quizzes every other week and an exam maybe after 3 quizzes. 
-The only thing is that he's very meticulous about lecturing such that he doesn't love it when people ask a ton of questions. It gets him antsy that we're taking up time when he could be finishing notes. He also isn't flexible with quizzes and exams. I emailed him that I was getting my vaccine and wanted to take the quiz ahead of time but he ignored my email. 
-Other than that, his exams are pretty reasonable similar to questions he goes over in lecture)
- I hear Guilick is good (he makes the exams I'm pretty sure). But the only thing about him is that he gives pop quizzes and Chadwick lets us know thru syllabus when quizzes are

gebremariam,5,A,PHYS161,"I love Bantu, he is the best! go to his office hours and befreind him he is a great guy. I already graduated two years ago but he has become my freind and mentor for a long time. What an amazing guy. so damn nice. godman",365
gebremariam,4,A,PHYS270,"Bantu makes PHYS270 a decent experience.    There are two midterms, each worth 12% of your grade, which is nice because most of the PHYS270 professors do 3 midterms.  Overall, they were pretty easy, with a few of the questions being very similar, or even direct questions from the homework.  

Lab is 25%, but that is the same regardless of your professor. Lab was, in my opinion, the worst part of the class.  There are only 4 labs (plus the culminating lab), but they all pretty much took the full 3 hours and were pretty tough.  Your experience is going to depend entirely on who your lab TA is.  If you get a good one, lab shouldn't be bad. 

Quizzes are 10% of your grade, and there is one at the end of each chapter.  He does not announce the quizzes beforehand, but if you follow his lectures and the schedule, you should know about when they will be.  They are almost always very easy and require only basic knowledge of the chapter.  Write down the equations as he is teaching, or start the homework before he finishes the chapter, and quizzes will be simple.

Homework is 21%, with 14% being masteringphysics and 7% being written.  The written is just to do 3 of the masteringphysics problems by hand on paper and turn it in, so it's not really extra work.  The masteringphysics tends to be pretty easy, so the homework isn't a huge burden. Do check often if there is an assignment though because he does not announce when he posts them.  Do not copy from the solutions manual because they are watching for that and a large portion of the class did just that on the first homework.

The exams were each 3 problems and were usually pretty simple.  The only issue is that since they are only 3 problems, if you are completely lost on one question, you already lost a large portion of your grade.  Study hard for these, redo the masteringphysics, and you'll be fine.

The final exam was a common final across all the sections, and was actually pretty easy.  It's hard to say if he curved the class because we did not get our final exam scores back, but I have a feeling that he did.",365
gebremariam,4,A+,PHYS161,"To be honest, the only reason I ever went to lecture was because of the unannounced pop quizzes. Bantu's lectures are pretty boring (and that's with a laptop). 

Mastering Physics (online HW) is more difficult than any of the tests (or the examples done in class).

If you have even marginal experience with physics this class is a review. (but a 3 on AP C Mech doesn't place you out).",365
gebremariam,3,B,PHYS270,"This guy isn't that bad, but he isn't that good. He should illustrate some more example problems. Instead, he primarily just uses Power-Point slides which are identical to the book, so if the book confuses you Bantu won't help that much. Also, I didn't like that he gives no sample exams whatsoever; on Fri. before a Mon. exam he just tell us ""3 problems 1 is on Chap 35, 2 is on 36, 3 is on 37"". However, his exams were really straightforward, everything was an example in the book or an assigned homework problem - no curve balls. ",365
gebremariam,4,A,PHYS270,"Bantu is a really nice guy and a decent lecturer, although he can be kind of boring. He goes through the material pretty slowly, which means his tests end up covering less material than usual for 270, so they are not very difficult in general.

He grades very fairly and I think there was a curve at the end of the semester.

He usually does one pop quiz a week, but the questions are so easy (as long as you have the equations written down).

The Mastering Physics hw is not too bad, especially since he gives you 5 chances to answer each question correctly, with no loss of credit until the last chance is used up. 

The only really annoying thing about Bantu was that he never emailed us when he posted assignments, so you basically have to check Blackboard constantly to see if there is a written assignment and you have to check MP to see if there is a new online assignment.

Overall, Bantu is definitely one of the better physics professors.",365
gebremariam,4,A,PHYS270,"Dr. Bantu is a very nice, easygoing professor who made PHYS270 a relatively easy experience. He's a rather dry lecturer, but he cracks jokes in lecture occasionally to wake up the many sleepy, bored students. 

However, his class was not too hard., especially compared to the other professor, Jenkins. The tests were straightforward (except maybe the second one, which almost no one finished), and the final was not even cumulative! MasteringPhysics was the homework system used and there was always help available if you knew where to look. There were quizzes in lecture at the end of each chapter, but most of the time you did not really have to go to lecture since he posts lecture powerpoints online. Also, discussion is useless. My TA always went on tangents that usually ended in him talking about Maxwell's equations, which was irrelevant to most of the topics we were covering.

The worst part of this class is the lab which counts for 25% of the 270 grade. Fortunately, we only had it every other week, but my experience was awful since no one knew what he or she was doing and the TA couldn't speak a word of English and explain anything!

Overall, definitely take Bantu over any other PHYS270 professor!",365

His exams are such curve balls there's aways one problem that will throw you off and he gives like 2 problems, so if you screw up one, you fail. He curves a lot at the end but you gotta have at least a 70% or higher to get a B. Which isn't bad but his exams are bad so that might be hard to get.

gebremariam,4,B,PHYS260,"I had Hailu for 161 and i loved him, however this year for 260 his setup is a little different due to covid and Im struggling a bit. Hes a very understanding prof and is so helpful if you have questions but the lecture videos are sooooooo boring i can barely get through them. ",365
gebremariam,1,C+,PHYS161,"I would give him 0 if that was possible. I think he doesn't deserve one dollar of his salary. He posted the lecture videos and never held class once, only proctored exams and quizes which is so nice of him honestly. He also never ever gave any study material for any test. ",365
gebremariam,2,A,PHYS161,"*class was fully online due to covid*
Imagine learning physics by reading a textbook. It's informative, but not particularly exciting. Now turn that textbook into a powerpoint. Literally just screenshot the equations from the digital version of the textbook and stick it in a powerpoint. Mix in an excessive amount of practice problems, usually solved wrong and usually easier than anything the test will give you. Now have a man read this powerpoint, veeerrryyy slooowwwlllyyy, unconstrained by the normal class schedule due to the asynchronous format of the class online. Thats Hailu. Looking back, I'm pretty sure that if I skipped every lecture and just read the textbook, I probably could have learned the same amount in half the time.
The class had quizzes every week over zoom. They were timed for 10 minutes, so if you had internet issues, you were kind of screwed. The quizzes varied wildly in difficulty, from high school trig to problems we haven't learned yet.
The class uses expert ta for all homework, which is actually very nice. It gives you hints and specific feedback if it knows why your answer is wrong.
The class is curved, but hailu seemed to be deliberately vague about how much, or whether he would curve down if final grades were too high. In the end, the 67% average on the final meant there was a generous curve up of at least a few percent.
Ultimately, take Hailu if you have to. He's not necessarily a good teacher, but he's also not actively bad.
",365
gebremariam,4,B+,PHYS260,"Dr. G is a very fair professor. His lectures are monotoned and slow, but his lecture videos are simple and easy to follow. The homework goes well with the lecture content but may get stuck on a few which is normal. Dr. G's quizzes are very fair and relate to the previous lecture content as well. He provides the equations and contents needed, so as long as you complete the homework (or most of it) before the quizzes, and are caught up on the lectures you are in good shape.

Exams are fair, but studying with book problems does help. Book problems are more challenging than exam problems but are a good tool for understanding the content more. ",365
gebremariam,1,,PHYS260,"Hailu is absolutely awful. His lecture videos are mind-numbingly boring and his ego is off the roof. Don't bother emailing him unless you want a snarky response that makes you feel stupid. His final exams are also incredibly hard, leaving everyone to wait anxiously for the curve to save their final grade. Save yourself and find a different prof",365
gebremariam,4,A,PHYS161,"I had him during fall 2020, so class was completely online. His lecture videos were somewhat monotonous but actually taught you the material if you paid attention, and he had good examples so I never felt the need to read the book to supplement in-class instruction. Make sure to watch out for numerical mistakes in his examples though! Quizzes were simple FRQs which reflected the main concept of the content for the week, and homeworks were pretty consistent with what was taught in class. (Some problems were hard, but that's normal). Midterm exams were pretty ok, final was really hard, but the curve takes care of it.",365
samet,1,A,CMSC420,"He's by far the worst professor I've ever seen. Some people say he's good because he wrote a bunch of thick books - but even those are not great. He talks down to everybody, beginning with students, and ending with his TA and fellow professors. (At the classes he talks about how other professors teaching the same class are so much worse than him, and how their slides are stolen from other people...) 

Then there's this Quadtree project, which is supposed to be written in C/C++ or Pascal. Still even though he claims to be an expert in all of them (and all Computer Science, for that matter), he constantly demonstrates he doesn't know what he's talking about. But again, according to him, everybody is wrong and only he's right.

At the classes, he sticks to his slides and rarely gets up from his chair. Whenever someone asks something that is not explicitly explained in there, he gets angry, saying that we're supposed to know it already. That may be acceptable if after saying it he would actually do the explanation, which of course, he doesn't (I suspect that's because he doesn't know anything out of those slides...). 

He's paranoid about using electronic tools like the submit server or the grade server - because of this, it's hard to keep track of your progress in the class. We've just taken the final, and if we want to find out our score, we have to go to his office...

I guess the only good thing about this course is that it teaches you how to work on your own, and not expect it to come from your instructor - in a way, it's a good life lesson... 

I wouldn't take any (other) course with him!",366
samet,1,,CMSC420,"I once heard Meesh say: ""Never use a binary search tree. If you use binary search then I'll laugh at you, because you're stupid. Use hashing."" So useful! So up-to-date!

On the first day of class, Samet spent 15 minutes comparing methods of string representation based on how much memory you can save by SHARING COMMON SUBSTRINGS. He claims to have lost the old Macintosh software that created his slides, and they're all marked Copyright 1997. You have the option of turning in your quadtree project in Pascal. So, not exactly cutting-edge.

The projects are all, without exception, sorely under-specified. For all of the projects the TA had to post lengthy clarifications to make the projects possible.

Right now, the early morning (!) section with Subrahmanian is full. Every time someone drops from that section, someone from Samet's section jumps ship, so Subrahmanian's stays full. 15 or so people actually show up for class every day in our section.

The infamous quadtree project is ridiculous. Within the first couple days of class you have to turn in your specification for the data structure. Four weeks later it must be completely finished supporting 15 different operations, along with a text-based command parser, makefile, etc. All code must be completely from scratch, and you'll need to implement a linked list, a heap, and a binary search tree (heh heh) during this time to finish your quadtree. We didn't get to quadtrees in lecture until December, so you need to figure everything out by reading his 1000+ page tome. And if, like me, you escaped 216 without ever learning how to use gdb then you'll have to develop a feel for that too because it's impossible to write 2,000 lines of bug-free anything (let alone C) without a fully-featured debugger.

Many weeks of class are wasted learning Lisp, which has nothing to do with data structures. Those projects are straightforward compared to the quadtree project, but they're nontrivial. 

The tests are hard. For the first midterm, out of 24 exams (by the way, note that the class started out full with 40 students) 1 got <30%, 2 others got <40%, 8 others got <50%, 7 others got <60%, 6 others got <70%, 4 others got <80%, and 1 other got <90%. So only 5 people got above a 70%.

I can't say it was a total waste of time, because I did gain a lot of experience writing crappy C code, but if I wanted to do that then I'd have taken OS.",366
samet,1,C,CMSC420,"Do not take Data Structures with Samet.

He knows the material well- he literally wrote the book on it, and he'll make sure you know it. He'll talk down to you, make a big deal about how you don't know anything, and not actually teach you very much you haven't already seen before in other classes until way after you've done the projects on them. He assigned us the notorious quadtree project, which while a fun exercise, isn't fun when you have only the first three weeks or so of the semester to finish it. If you aren't experienced writing thousand-line projects with C/C++/Pascal, if you appreciate your Friday nights as times to not do work, or if you like teachers that give you reasonable test cases and use the submit server instead of making the TA grade your output by hand... you will start hating this course very early if you take it with Samet.

He teaches on overhead slides and ""animated"" pdfs. He teaches us to think recursively, and teaches us how trees work, and seems to think he has a better definition for just about everything in Computer Science than everyone else. (He doesn't.) He doesn't use the submit server because the process ""isn't human enough"" for him.

He really really does know his stuff. He's a smart guy, but he teaches you the material in vague, opinionated terms using materials that a) largely haven't been updated in over a decade and b) don't really correspond with the rest of our CS education.

But hey, he's still teaching the course, so he must be doing something right... oh, that's right- tenure. Never mind.",366
samet,1,B-,CMSC420,"Probably the best thing about this guy is that he is very smart and knows what he's talking about. Unfortunately, thats where the good things end.

On the the first day of class, he assigns the notorious quadtree project. Although the first two parts of it are very easy, parts 3 and 4 are complete hell. Samet himself gives no instruction on the project himself, instead telling you to learn about quadtrees from the long project description and gigantic textbook of his. He then goes off lecturing us about linked lists and other stupid structures we already learned about time and time again.

During lectures, he simply reads off lecture slides which he wrote, making lecture extremely boring. He tries to engage students by calling on them randomly and asking them questions, but (unsurprisingly) people rarely ever answer them the way he wants. If you don't learn the material from lecture, you have two other resources to learn the material from: Notes on Data Structures and Multidimensional Data Structures, two books which were also written by Samet. So yeah, you basically learn stuff by reading the same material three times. And don't try to learn the material from somewhere else: Samet has carefully added his own opinion and bias to his course materials, and these are often important for the test. If you put down that ""an advantage of doubly linked lists is that you can traverse backwards"", he will frustratingly mark you wrong.

He seems to have this delusion that CMSC 420 is the only class his students are taking, and that we spend all of our time on it. It is not below him to assign extra homework assignments and lectures whenever he wants, and he often does this, even when students are buried in projects or other work for his class. We had class Tuesdays and Thursdays, and he would literally assign extra lectures on Fridays, and then would get upset when only 8 people showed up to them. 

Seriously, I don't know what people see in him. My rating is based solely on his TEACHING, not on his intelligence or research. It's people like Samet that really make we wish the tenure system is abolished and that teaching departments actually had some quality control.",366
samet,4,A,CMSC420,"Intelligent

He is sarcastic at times but quite insightful during lectures. He knows the material very well (much of it deriving from his own areas of interests) while capable of going beyond the normal curriculum. However, do be discrete about questions as he will digress/rant at times if they are bad. Pre-reading lecture slides are not necessary imo, just careful understanding during the lectures. Projects may be seem long but are relatively easy if you understand the problem's nature. Exams were relatively easy",366
samet,1,,CMSC420,"I think the best way to write a review for Dr. Samet would be in a list
format, so here it goes:

1) His teaching style is not engaging and will put you to sleep.  He asks
the class many questions, and it's rare that students ever answer them
correctly to Samet's standards.
2)He has an extremely abrasive personality and talks down to students like
they're children.  I felt like I was in middle school again many times
throughout the semester.  He also spoke badly about other professors in
the department in front of the entire class.  He literally said most of
them don't know anything, especially about simple things like linked
lists.  I found this to be absurd and very unprofessional.
3)He was away on travel a lot throughout the semester and re-scheduled
class a few times on different days than when class originally took place.
 Whenever some people wouldn't show up to these re-scheduled sessions, he
would chastise the class and lecture us about how he's taking the time out
of his schedule to lecture us and how everyone needs to be there.  Problem
is, the class was on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and rescheduling the class on
a Friday evening means half of the class won't be able to be there because
of work, other scheduled activities, or other private matters.  Samet has
a really difficult time understanding this.
4)He's a smart guy and has been teaching the material for so long that he
completely understands it but expects everyone else to understand it at
the same magnitude of his understanding.  This makes him have a difficult
time coming down to the level of undergrads and understanding that most of
us are absorbing the material in the class for the first time, hence most
of us actually having to learn the material.  He constantly refers to
topics in the class as common sense and gets agitated when students are
left feeling clueless from his awful teachings.
5)The infamous quadtree project gets assigned on the first day of class,
yet he teaches absolutely nothing about quadtrees.  He told the class to
look at some Java applets that show examples of how quadtrees work and
told us to go read his encyclopedic book.  That project was the most
horrendous project I've done at UMD and the major reason why it was so
difficult was because I didn't have a good understanding of quadtrees as I
was left to research them on my own.  It would've been extremely helpful
if he spent the first few days of lecture talking about the mechanics of
quadtrees and tips on how to implement certain operations.  Instead, he
jumped right into teaching us data structures we've learned as freshmen
and assigned other homework assignments on top of the newly assigned
quadtree project.

There are other things about Dr. Samet I could mention, but I feel that
the five things listed above should provide a decent foundation of what to
expect from him.  In regards to the class, I found the exams and some of
the homework assignments to be difficult.  Besides the quadtree project
(which has to be implemented in C, C++, or Pascal), the remaining
programming projects are all done in Lisp and are straight forward.

I don't recommend Dr. Samet for this class, and if I could go back in time
I would've taken it with another professor as I truly don't feel I've
learned much from his class at all.  I feel like I am walking away with a
semi-understanding of some convoluted, advanced data structures and the
knowledge of little tricks that can be used for simple data structures to
save space that pointers/references take up.",366
samet,4,,CMSC420,"He is a very smart man, and wants to teach.  He grades tests very fairly and is willing to take time out of his day for you.

It may well seem like he has difficulty coming down to the level of undergraduate students to explain things in a way we easily understand.  However, a lot of the difficulty in learning from him can be alleviated by pre-reading the material in the textbook (or, more specifically, the extended notes corresponding to the lecture slides) before class.  He expects you to pre-read, which is reasonable but quite time consuming.  If you don't pre-read, it will be hard to learn from his lectures.",366
samet,1,B,CMSC420,"Incredibly rude professor, constantly yelling at people for asking questions or for not having known material. In our class, someone joined the class late because somebody dropped the class so they got on off the waitlist. Samet spent the first 15 minutes of the class lecturing the guy who joined late saying ""this class isn't a train, you can't get on and off whenever you want, you need to have done all the homeworks already. Where are they??""

There's no grade server or submit server, he made us print some of our projects and hand them in, and we didn't receive grades until a couple days ago. There's also no elms page, and he hasn't sent a single email or message on elms out. All he does is sit there and yell at people, definitely would not take.",366
samet,1,W,CMSC420,"In my family, I am perceived as the ""smart one"" and basically forced to help my younger sibling in 6th grade math homework. Admittedly though, nothing much is learned during these tutor sessions because I cannot fathom how what I 100% understand to be difficult and because I do not have any teaching skills at all. Now imagine me, but now I am over 70 years old, very unfamiliar with very recent technology, and is paid to teach. That is basically professor Hanan Samet. He is really smart, having pioneered research into Computer Science and even has his own wikipedia page. But all that matters is if he can teach college students and my god he doesn't.

Taken him with online classes, his lectures were boring and barely understandable. Most of it consisted of him going through a pdf of illustrations that are hardly understandable by itself, therefore you have to watch the lecture so he can explain what it all means, but then you can't get through the dull barrier or understand at all. Also for some reason the slides and chapter pdfs given do not support ctrl+f, and this is especially bad given that these things are huge pages of text.

The big project seems to be the same each time according to the other reviews, but this time the project was split into parts with different due dates. While I appreciate it making me keep my procrastination in check, the project was still god awful. This mostly comes down to the information on the project like the project description. I've learned more on how to do the project from piazza than the pdf given. At one point, plenty of people received zero's because the hidden tests were exponentially larger than the sample ones given. Fortunately we were given a second chance to edit our project, but I wasn't happy having to edit in C of all things. They still made us use these weird huge inputs for the later parts that just makes it too difficult to debug. Oh yeah instead of using gradescope or the submit server to submit code, Samet uses Elms. Gradescope is used, but only for written homework.

I should have known this professor was not gonna be good at all when the only section open for 420 was him. I wish I actually saw all these previous reviews before I was too desperate to take something for the semester. If I had the ability, I would go full Jimmy Neutron and time travel back to the exact time and location I was signing up on Testudo. I would slap that laptop out of his hand and tell myself to get a new laptop, because it's way cheaper than the tuition taking his class.",366

I felt that we barely went over the material needed. The final exam focused only on topics after  the 2nd midterm and she gave 0 practice on the final exam(she is a new teacher so we had nothing to go off of). Obviously this explains the insanely low average for the final, 65, and she refused to create a fair curve. For some reason she believes a 95% or higher is an A but a 60 is a C-, very unfairly weighted. Avoid this teacher unlesse you think you can get a 95+ on all assignments/quizzes.

You really need to start the projects within a couple days of them being due, the concepts are more theoretical in this class, in 131/132/216 everything was fairly straightforward.

We had 5 quizzes (announced) and they were generally on the easy side, just testing basic knowledge of what was going on during lecture. I had Richard Johnson as my TA, he was very helpful.
No discussion programming projects. 

Exams:
We had one exam on Ruby/NFA/DFA/Regex/CFG and maybe some other stuff. This exam was pretty straightforward and easy. The second midterm was on Ocaml/Operational Sematics/Multithreading, this exam was pretty hard. The final was a little easier than the second exam.

milchberg,5,B,ENEE690,"Can be a little difficult to approach but he does care about teaching and is very willing to help.

Some times I think he doesn't realize how difficult his hw/exams can be but overall a solid teacher and fair grader.  

Seems to appreciates effort, know your hw inside/out and you'll be ready for at least 50% of any exam.  Think more about concepts, I never got anything lame a like a derivation or extremely calc heavy problem on a test. ",373
milchberg,5,A,PHYS270,"Milchberg is a decent lecturer and a great/hilarious guy. Homework was straight out of the textbook for 270, and the exams were pretty insane, but his grading is dependent on progress. The departmental final for 270 meant that after his exams the final was a cakewalk and almost everyone in the class walked away with an A. 

Just wish I could take him for 420, but they switched up the professors on me. ",373
milchberg,5,A-,PHYS270,I would say Milchberg is an above average lecturer. In his lectures he spends time deriving formulas and explaining concepts. He will include a few examples but not too many. His reviews before the final and midterms were helpful where he could do more examples and summarize concepts. The homework is time consuming but you get roughly 2 weeks per assignment to complete it. He also uses an improvement grading style where only your best midterm is counted and if your final exam grade is higher than your best midterm then that counts for both your final exam grade and midterm grades. Usually on midterms and the final he will include a problem that's similar to the homework. Overall Milchberg is a nice professor and wants to help his students.,373
appelbaum,5,,PHYS402,"One of the best physics lecturers I had: 1)extremely thorough and clear presentation of QM, with lecture notes posted; 2)put effort into designing the course, supplementing Griffiths' textbook with his own derivations which are often more insightful; 3)challenging but well-written homework problems focusing on physics concepts. 
That being said, he held (perhaps righteously) high standards for his students therefore gave difficult exams. But, even when the problem seemed really hard, you could manage to solve it if you followed and understood all his lecture notes (which I should have done but didn't). I definitely learned a lot in his class and did not regret taking him. It's not an easy ride, but neither is QM. ",374
appelbaum,1,B,PHYS402,"Probably the worst professor I've ever had. He had unrealistic expectations of the students, a monotonous classroom experience, and did not provide nearly enough support to his students. His exams were purposeful attempts to fool students, a fact of his teaching strategy that he shared with us.
Moreover, he made me really dislike QM, something I would have thought impossible.

Avoid at all costs.",374

He helps you through the projects if you ask for it. He had a midterm and a final exam. Both are worth a significant portion of your grade and they are extremely challenging. Be prepared for those things. Other than that this was an amazing course with a great professor. ,380
farquhar,3,A,GEOL124,"Farquhar is a really nice guy, almost too nice. 

I came into this class expecting a challenging, engaging course on how life evolved on earth from the beginning to its present day form. While we certainly did cover some of this, it seemed that climate change was a bigger topic of discussion than life itself. I can't say that I didn't learn anything, I definitely did. It just wasn't the type of stuff I expected to learn. The class itself was generally boring, although there were a couple topics where the material was interesting and Farquhar gave a good lecture. 

As for Farquhar himself, like I said he is extremely nice and overly agreeable. He is also the most awkward teacher I have ever had. Half the time it seemed like he was scared to death of public speaking. He wants his students to succeed and do well, but he isn't commanding enough. Farquhar also tends to go off track and talk about his research. I actually didn't mind listening to this though because it tended to be more interesting than the lecture slides. Farquhar knows his stuff but has a hard time of conveying it. The TA, Brian, was very good and explained things well. The discussion sections were a lot lighter and more social. 

As for the difficulty level of the class, I don't understand how anyone can possibly get less than a B if you go to class even half the time. We had two projects for the class. In one we had to go to the National History museum in DC. The worksheet we had to fill out was dreadful, and it took me about 3 hours to complete. The museum itself is really interesting though. The other project was a group project which was pretty easy. The tests are easy and you get extra credit all over the place. I'm sitting at a 91% for the year and barely did any work. If you spend 1/2 hour studying for the tests and an hour studying for the final you'll get good grades. 

The class was meh. Not awesome, not terrible. I learned a decent amount and got a good grade with no work. ",382
farquhar,1,B,GEOL124,"This class is DREADFUL!! Yes, the subject has potential to be interesting (which is why i signed up for it) but the teacher just completely killed every ounce of that appeal.  He rambles like crazy!  I can not even begin to explain how off topic he gets for such extended amounts of time.  Also, his planning is awful.  The syllabus is pointless because he follows no lesson plan at all.  He becomes so completely engrossed in one subject that we would end up spending more than 2 weeks on one graph.  He also has a tendency of assuming everyone has an extensive knowledge of every subject in science ever so lectures, on top of being highly disorganized, are impossible to understand.

As for course load there were two projects.  For one, we had to answer 10
+ pages of specific questions pertaining to various exhibits at the Museum of Natural History.  It personally took me 5 hours to complete, it was 10% of our grade.  The other project was a group project where you had to make a wiki page on a topic concerning global warming/climate change/etc. We had 2 mid-terms, each of which asks very specific questions like what is the energy output of the sun, and the choices varied only in decimal placement. There is also a final which is cumulative.

For discussion, life was not so bad.  The T.A. is a million times better than the professor and section was kind of interesting.  For the whole course, every week you had to read a chapter out of the discussion book and answer a question pertaining to that chapter, very easy.

In conclusion, do not take this class.  Even though discussion was good, having to deal with the lecture is not worth it.   ",382
farquhar,2,B,GEOL124,"awful class. do NOT take this class unless you want to be absolutley bored and angry the whole time. farquhar gets off topic about his field research and science buddies half the time, and then expects you to understand everything he didn't say. even though it says its an easy core science class, STAY AWAY.",382
farquhar,3,A-,GEOL444,"Farquhar is a really nice professor, and he clearly knows a TON about what he's talking about — he discovered a decent amount of the things we learned about! But as someone with basically no experience with what he was teaching us about, a lot of the class ended up going over my head and was just really hard to absorb. Honestly think the only reason I did well in this class is because our TA was a huge help, Farquhar gave us all 100% for participation, and I think he put a pretty big curve on the final. Be prepared to put a lot of work in outside class!",382
purtilo,5,A,,"This was a very interesting honors seminar. Purtilo is very passionate about the material he teaches, and I learned a lot about privacy. The workload is reasonable, and he will give you a good grade if you write thoughtfully. I definitely recommend taking this course with Purtilo.  ",384
purtilo,4,A+,CMSC132H,"Purtilo is a solid professor who respects his students. He is an efficient teacher, and he frequently ended class early, since we tended to get ahead of the other sections. He makes it clear that he is dedicated to producing ""satisfied customers"" of his students.",384
purtilo,4,A-,,"Purtilo was an extremely engaging professor. The class was all and all fairly easy and as long as you turn in coherent thoughtful work, he'll give you an A. He brought in a ton of interesting guest speakers. Make sure you start on the paper early, it'll help you greatly when you have to cram down towards the end of the semester. ",384
purtilo,1,,CMSC435,"One of the most useless classes I ever took at Maryland, and Purtilo was mostly responsible for that. I learned almost nothing from this class, because, duh, he doesn't teach at all. Most of the class time is spent either meeting with your teams for the class project (will get to it in a sec). And even when he lectures, the topics are lamest and most useless. ""Change is inevitable,"" he will say multiple times during the lectures. And that's about all you will get from this class (but didn't you already know that).
Now about the class project. One of the most horribly designed software I have ever seen in my life -- Terpnav. The thing (hard to call it a software) has 10 different languages supporting it, is spread over multiple machines with source code that has no documentation, and even Purtilo doesn't know how to install and run the thing. But he persists with it every semester, makes students add features to it, which is not hard in itself, but dealing with this beast of a software is the most annoying part, and yet not worth it at all. And the final is a take-home, which is entirely based on the TerpNav project. So, almost all your grade comes from the class project. He will say in the beginning there will be smaller projects too (we had just one), but essentially what you do with TerpNav is all that accounts for your grade.
Take this class with anyone but Purtilo. I have heard some other professors do much better job.",384
purtilo,5,,CMSC132H,"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR CMSC132 OR ANY INTRO-LEVEL CLASS......FOR AN UPPER LEVEL COURSE HE HAS NO EQUAL. Just so we are clear. 

Dr. Purtilo is a phenomenal professor, engaging lecturer, and an all-around wonderful person. However, he is simply not interested in teaching lower level classes. He instead will lecture on far more upper-level topics of overall software engineering and product development which, while very interesting, have little to do with the course material. He will occasionally go through the syllabus but blow through it at a staggering speed so no one can not learn any of it.

In our class he did ""show and tell"" Fridays where he brought in ancient relics of computer engineering and explained their functions, inner workings, and how modern design has since expanded. For one interested in such a subject this experience is phenomenal, but anyone taking the course simply to learn Java would roll their eyes.

 If you enroll in his class you will want to attend every lecture out of interest, however, will have to pray that another professor posts their lecture slides and that your TA knows how to actually code in Java (or read the textbook I suppose...gasp!). My course took a significant amount of outside-lecture work.

He has long left Java in his profession so any syntax question on its inner workings (you know, the entire midterm and final test material) he will do his best to answer for you and certainly take time outside of class to be sure he gets you the right answer. But this whole process could have been avoided by simply taking a professor more focused on lower-level programming.

If you are competent learning material outside of lecture and are genuinely interested in computer science his knowledge, persona, and class complete a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn material beyond the textbook from a truly remarkable person. BUT If you are taking a lower level class to satisfy some random requirement his class will require a lot of unnecessary work.",384
purtilo,4,,,"The class material was very interesting. Towards the middle/end of the semester we had guest speakers every lecture or so from all different fields of industry, including many from the three-letter-agencies. The final paper at the end was a doozy, but the trick with that (like everything) is getting started early. The professor, unlike most Comp Sci instructors, is very helpful and approachable outside of class. Overall, an enjoyable experience and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",384
purtilo,1,,CMSC435,"The most unorganized and effortless professor I have ever met. Pop quizzes in the first 5 minute of the class, if you are a bit late then f u. Every project is group project.

What you did is a big group project which is lack instruction, all you do is to figure out how to start from zero to 100 by yourself.  I paid way more time than in this project than in other classes. After demo, presentation, documentation writing. You also need to write a final (which is like a 4000 words reports to him) reflect your effort on this project.",384
reggia,5,,CMSC289I,"A truly wonderful professor. I'd heard mixed stories about CMSC289I beforehand, but Prof. Reggia made this class a great experience. He was always friendly, and very approachable via office hours and email. After every homework, quiz, and exam, Prof. Reggia took great pains to make sure we understood the content before moving onto new topics. Even if people had still trouble understanding the material, Prof. Reggia strongly encouraged students to ""grab me or one of the TAs after class"". 

The content itself was great. This class provided a great opportunity to see how broad a field it really is. One definitely doesn't need to be a CS major to get something out of this class.

In short, excellent professor and excellent class. ",386
reggia,5,A,CMSC289I,"One of the best professors I've had in my UMD experience. His slides were easy to understand, and he made sure that everyone understood the content before moving on. For example, he'd give ungraded quizzes from time to time, and always take time afterwards to explain what was going on. The same went for the exams. After each of the midterms, Prof. Reggia took a good chunk out of his lectures to make sure we got the content. Both in lecture and in office hours, he was very friendly and polite; in fact he encouraged us to stop by if we were worried about grades, homework, or a topic not clearly understood from lecture.

If you have a chance to take a course under Prof. Reggia, do it. ",386
reggia,5,A,CMSC289I,"This is from the perspective of a CMSC student.

Reading the description, I was worried this class wouldn't be as suitable for Computer Science students, but was happily wrong. 
The class does not require mathematical knowledge beyond algebra(logarithms are briefly explained, and provided for you in many cases).
The class also does not require previous knowledge in computer programming.  While it will be easier to understand some of the concepts with a ComSci baackground, it is in no way required or required to do well.

If you are a Computer science student interested in AI, you will enjoy this class as well.  Many of the concepts, algorithms, and techniques taughts can be used in your other CMSC courses as well as CMSC421 of course.


The grade is made up of 20% for homework and quizzes, 20% for each of two midterms, and 40% for the final.  
We had 9 homework assignments regularly spread out through the semester.  Each homework took roughly a couple hours to complete, and plenty of time was given to complete them.  Part of the homework would be 'randomly' selected and be graded, the rest wouldn't be graded.
There was 1 quiz early in the semester, then a second quiz that wasn't graded.  
The two midterms were difficult, not cumulative, but thorough, and resulted in low averages, about 50-60%.
The final was cumulative and mainly consisted of problems that were already reinforced through homeworks as well as trivia-esque questions.
While the averages for some of the homeworks and the midterms were fairly low, there was a very generous curve, and Dr. Reggia revealed an estimate of how the curve would be done based on each of the midterms. Though not estimated in class, the curve also affects the homework and final exam.

Essentially, if you finished the homeworks and understood them, paid attention in class and did the readings, you could get an A without it being a high-stress course.

After every homework, quiz, and midterm, each question was reviewed in depth and Dr. Reggia gave numerous opportunities for students to ask questions.  

Dr. Reggia is very approachable after class and in office hours.  ",386

Turned out to be the hardest class I've taken at UMD. On top of that there is no discussion so you don't really have an opportunity to make sense of what you cover in class. If your looking for an easy CORE class, THIS IS NOT IT.

Reggia- Nicest guy ever. Went to him a week before the final breaking down bc I had like a F in the class and he was so comforting, and reassuring. Told me if I got a C on the final he'd give me a C in the class. And I did:)",386

At one point he was asked to solve one of our test problems on the blackboard and he was unable to do it.

Pros:
+ Very clearly passionate about the subject matter, if you like astronomy you'll love this class.
+ Class content is pretty interesting and made topical through the use of real world examples.
+ (Kinda) easy A (See below).
+ Tests are extremely generous. Basically, after you take them, you immediately take the same test again in your group, allowing you to net a lot more points. This is carefully designed to never hurt your grade, only help.

Cons:
- Despite the course being designated as for nonscience majors, the course actually does require quite a bit of rudimentary knowledge of math, science, and physics. Some help is given during class, but most likely not enough. STEM majors will be fine, but non-STEM majors should be prepared for some additional studying.
- Class organization was a bit strange, as we had to take extensive notes of pre-lecture videos that were quite long, but in class lectures mostly didn't go over any new content.",392

However, if you are taking her for MATH113, the content is a bit easier since 90% of it is just stuff that you learned in high school. Also, I am not sure if this is just because of COVID-19 but we used a software called knewton alta and that provided a good amount of practice for 70% percent of the material and for the stuff that she really just flies by without much practice Khan academy will be your best friend.

Take home midterm was a rehash from the grad level class 10 years ago, plus 3 more pages, and way beyond the scope of what we'd learned in class.

There are only a few things holding me back from giving him five stars. Firstly, he goes on a lot of tangents. If you are the type of student who learns solely from lectures, it might be difficult since sometimes he does not cover all of the material. Secondly, he seems to have difficulty teaching the students who have difficulty grasping the concepts.

Like some of the other reviews said, he covers the material really quickly and perhaps not in as much detail as they should be, but if you do the worksheets in discussion and/or study, you'll be fine. His lectures are good to go to because he covers a lot of stuff that other professors don't, and talks about philosophy and stuff sometimes (its always somewhat relevant though).

His exams are so long and you have to budget your time really well if you want to finish. 

The lab is a decent amount of work, but it's an easy boost to your grade if you submit everything on time. It's not super hard to get an A in the class, you just have to focus on the bigger concepts when studying. I do recommend Buchner, just be ready to put in the time for a 4 credit class! ",402

Any break out room I joined NO ONE had any clue what was going on. On the first exam the average was a 75 and the second exam's average was a 65 and he didn't curve either which led me to drop the class. It was insanely difficult to pay attention in his class. If you see John Quah on your schedule I advise you to drop that class IMMEDIATELY! Literally, take any other professor. He seems like a nice guy but a really bad professor.",406

He can also be passive aggressive.",406
quah,1,B-,MATH120,"He's a really really nice guy, but super confusing with his lectures. I had never taken calc before this class and he expected everyone in an elementary calc class to know what he was teaching before he taught it. His lectures often made you more confused and he did examples without even teaching the content. His exams are very different from the study guides and he doesn't curve anything. He put us in breakout rooms pretty often and no one ever knew what was going on. I ended up teaching myself the content through MyMathLab. Overall, would not recommend taking the class with this professor.",406

His lectures are very boring and he does not teach content, he just does some problems or goes off on tangents that make no sense. I often never payed attention to lectures because what he was saying did not apply to the homework or exams. I did very well in MyMathLab, homework was very easy and did not prepare you for his exams. His exams are extremely difficult!! He gives problems containing calculus he never taught us. He has a theory that the best, smartest students should get 65% on his tests because “the best” basketball players shoot 2/3 of their baskets. Do not take this class. It will fuck you over. I would give him zero stars ",406

ouyang,4,A,PHYS271,"It takes a while to get used to his accent, but once you do he's a pretty good teachers.  Lectures can be boring; i often did homework during lecture.  However, he uses detailed powerpoints and will post them online so you can look over them.  There are random lecture quizzes, but just for completing them you get a 9/15 so they help boost your grade a little.  Also the weekly problems you get for hw are often taken right from the book, so take a look in the book to see if there is anything in there that might help you solve the problem.  Also Min makes sure that students know he cares about their grade and wants to help them succeed, and this was good to have from a professor.",413

He is understanding about making up quizzes, and makes his lectures interesting. He wants his students to do well. Justin answers e-mails so quickly, and can always provide helpful answers. He always gives 2 study guides with the solutions for each exam. His exams were all fair. Not easy, but everything that was on the exam was thoroughly taught. I can't stress how awesome of a professor he is.",414

He had all of his PDFs laid out and available.  They were concise and had plenty of examples.  The assignments were overall fairly straightforward, though you may have to think for a few minutes about a couple of the later ones.  You get a second chance to get a 100% if your code is incorrect after the first submission, which was a nice bonus.  He always got back to my e-mails pretty quickly and did his best to help with any errors I was having in my code just through e-mail.  I got a 100% in the class and would definitely recommend his intro to MATLAB course.",414

He presents the materials in ways that anyone (even with poor background and fundamentals in math) can understand if he/she puts some effort.
He tells students what to focus for the exams.
TA was extremely nice and helpful as well.
Wyss-Gallifent is just a really cool professor. 
His exams were fair (more on easy side since i falied Calc 1 once and re-took it during spring semester).
He's extremely nice guy.
When Levermore had a class before us, and left the board messy and ended late (about 2~3 minutes before our class time), Justin never lost his cool. Not even once.
Take him. If you put in a little bit of effort, you're gonna pass.",414

I never had to use the textbook because his notes are so clear. Tests are difficult enough to let you see if you actually are understanding the material, but not so difficult that you feel like crap after taking them.

I also took the MATLAB course. The tutorial was really helpful and clear. I spent maybe 10 hours total the entire semester on this class, and that includes learning MATLAB from scratch and doing the projects. Take this class as early as possible; it's easy, not a lot of work, and a decent introduction to MATLAB.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,"Justin is more or less the ideal math professor. Energetic, engaging, and interesting, his lectures proceed at the perfect pace with exactly the right balance between examples and theory. 

Just take him already. Think of a complimentary adjective that could apply to a professor and it probably applies to Justin. Seriously, if it's a choice between Justin and someone else, it's not a choice. Justin all the way. Why are you still reading this? Go to Testudo and register for his class already.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH206,"Justin is amazing if you don't already know.

I had him for calc3 and he was boss. 

My review is more for the Matlab course. If you need a GPA booster, take this class. Justin is really helpful, and provides awesome tutorials. Also, the TA is amazing. If I wasn't sure about something, I just emailed the TA, and he made things really clear, so definitely take advantage of him (he's grading your projects anyways). There are only three projects and Justin gives you a lot of time to do them. The last project is a little tricky but the TA offers a lot of guidance. Take this course, you won't regret it.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A-,MATH241,"TAKE JUSTIN FOR ANY CLASS! He is literally the best professor I've had at Maryland by far! He explains concepts really well and he even adds some math humor into the lectures sometimes. Even though calc 3 wasn't always easy, he explained things very well and there was never a moment in class where I felt lost. 

His exams are very fair if you pay attention in lecture, and do the suggested but optional homework problems he posts online. Definitely go to discussions because there is a quiz at least once a week in discussion. 

The quizzes in discussions are 10 points each and add up to be 100 points of the total point value of the class. There are also 3 Matlab projects throughout the semester and 1 Matlab quiz, each worth 25 points, also adding up to 100 points. We had four exams in the semester, each exam worth 100 points each. The final exam this year was written by Justin and was also fair, no surprises. 

Overall, I really enjoyed Calc 3 with Justin and I would retake another class with him if I could. ",414

wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,"Great person, even better professor.

You don't need to get the textbook, he will teach you everything you need to know in class and dumb it down for the people who really know nothing about math (which is not the best for some people because if you go into higher math later, it is possible that you won't able to deal with some of the complex proofs and derivations since justin's version of 241 is so simplified). Very reasonable exams; he only gives you problems you have seen before. Has weekly quizzes in discussions, four matlab projects (actually 3 and then 1 matlab quiz), four exams, and a final. Nothing is too hard in this class; everyone should be fine.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH206,Never actually met him because this is an online course. But it was a great class. A great introduction to MATLAB. He explained things on his website very clearly and had plenty of examples and practice problems. He was also always willing to answer questions through email and was very respectful. There were three projects I think. They were pretty easy but last one took a little bit of time to do but was still very doable. I felt like the class was extremely helpful especially since I was taking differential equations at the same time which uses MATLAB. Plus the class is only like three months long. I highly recommend the class. ,414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH241,"I took Justin for Math 241 fall of '11, and have to say that he brought back a love of math I thought UMD math teachers had sufficiently killed off in me.

Justin is a great math teacher. He is not only approachable but a genuinely nice guy who teaches because he loves to teach. He is a lecturer, NOT someone who is being forced to take time away from their work to teach the class.

My biggest recommendation is a simple one. Swing by his office hours and say hello. I found myself practically living out of his office once I started going. It was a great place to get math work done, get extra problems, or just chat, and Justin is a great source for math help as well as random facts and entertainment.

In addition to everything I've already said, I want to point out that for anyone afraid of Matlab, Justin's are very reasonable, and his guides will get you through most of them without any problem. Justin is also very fast about answering emails with questions, especially as MATLAB assignments approach their deadlines.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B+,MATH241,Justin is hands-down the best math professor I have had at this university. He knows how to explain the topics without confusing the class with worthless proofs and MATLAB. His sense of humor is great and it is apparent he really cares for his students. I recommend going out of your way to have Justin as a professor before you graduate.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,One of the best teachers I've ever had in my life. (Possibly this will hold true for the rest of college!) He writes precise notes with great handwriting and pictures and explains topics in great detail. Doesn't grade homeworks but they are helpful! Has about one quiz per week in discussion but they're mostly up to the TA. Assigns three MATLABs where he gives tutorials for all of them so it's basically an application of it and there's one super easy quiz on it as well. Four tests and a final and his tests should be easy since you get a cheat sheet as well,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,Love him. Everyone would attend his lecture even at 9am. His style of his exams are exactly the same thing as his review sheets. No webassign and only matlab which he gives tutorials on. This guy is the best. Take any math class with him.,414

His exams are fair, he makes sure you know the material inside and out, he's really nice and funny, always willing to answer questions and explain things thoroughly.  Whether you are an A student or an F student, take his class.  He is a wonderful person and an intelligent professor.  Also, the lowest 7 webassigns being dropped doesn't hurt either, ha haha",414

He teaches the class with theory and lots of examples. His notes were so good that I only opened my book to do the hw. His pace with the syllabus is reasonable but faster compared to other professors because Justin wants to spend more time in the latter chapters. Those chapters are crazy so it will benefit in the long run. His exams are easy and follows the sample exams he posts before the exams. There are three easy matlab assignments. The fourth one is a short matlab quiz. All matlab related hw/quiz is easy. The final was not that bad. But do not underestimate the finals. You still need to work hard. Do not miss out on taking a course with Justin. ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,,MATH241,"Prof. Justin teaches the material by going step-by-step through each example and he even goes over examples of harder problems (which other profs rarely do). He is very down to earth for a person who holds a PhD. Assignments: 4 exams (none dropped), 4 matlabs (the last was a quiz counted as a matlab to make sure we were actually doing our own matlab assignments), 12 quizzes (2 dropped), and the final. Doesn't really curve grades since the average is usually high for a math course (low 80's).",414

Curve is very light, 4 percent this year, but class was easy.

And you don't really need the textbook. He gives example exams which are close to the real thing, and the discussions help too. I didn't buy one and got an A.",414

Great guy - just take him and you'll see!",414

He covers a lot of material in every lecture, but not so much that you ever feel overwhelmed. As long as you put in the necessary effort, this class should be no problem.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH475,"Really good teacher, especially compared to other math professors at UMD. One of the things I love about Justin is that he is humble. If he felt one of his lectures wasn't perfectly clear, he'll spend some of next class clarifying the tougher bits. Many professors just move on and leave the stragglers behind.

I'm not a huge fan of the group works, but they're fairly infrequent. He grades very easily on them because they're tough.

Plus he brought us bagels!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,,MATH130,"I am going to compare Cremins vs Justin

So I took MATH130 with Cremins first. He is not a bad professor at all, but if I had a choice, I would have definitely waited one semester to take it with Justin. Cremins teaches relatively well, but at a quick pace so taking his lectures would be beneficial to you if you took calculus before in high school or somewhere else. His exams are challenging sometimes. If you have never seen calculus before in your life, then take it with Justin. Unlike Cremins, Justin really takes everything step by step to make sure you know whatever he is teaching means and why he is doing whatever he is doing. Justin also puts out sample tests that are pretty much verbatim, (except for variables and etc.) to the actual exams. The grading system he has is also good because you can either concentrate on your exam grades, or your group work, quizzes, and final and take the higher grade. Meaning if you get an overall C on your midterms and get an overall B on group work, quizzes, and the final, you get a B in the class. This is much more flexible than Cremins, where you get what you get out of the entire total of quizzes, mid terms, etc.

Justin sometimes writes useless transitions like ""lets think about this"" or ""think about it!"" but that doesn't really bother me too much. His handwriting is also very neat, which sometimes Cremins lacks.

So in a nutshell, if you have taken calculus before, are really good at math, Cremins is a good choice. If you are not so great at math and want a slightly easier grading policy, Justin's the way to go.",414

-one math discussion a week with a 10 point quiz. he only counts 10. there are 13 or 14. win.
-one bio discussion a week with an easy 10 point group work. same deal: only counts 10. win again.
-you'll only need the textbook for [optional] homework or extra review problems.
- he gives one or two sample exams. he gives an ENTIRE lecture before a test as a review day. go to it,do the sample exams, and YOU CAN'T FAIL.

He would explain things that you thought you knew, but he would give you a deeper understanding about it. He is a really cool guy and makes lecture fun with his jokes.If your taking calc, make sure you have him as your professor and no one else. He is hands down the best teacher I've ever had. lol I wish he taught calc 3 lol",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A-,MATH140,"I also took Gulick's 140 my first semester here and although he was a great teacher, I still had a difficulty learning and understanding the material. Justin made it really simple and easy to understand. By writting literally every word on the board taking notes was easy. His sense of humor and cool accent are an added bonus!

I really wish he taught all of my math classes!!!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A-,MATH140,"There's a reason Justin is the highest rated professor on this site: he is the absolute man. I had the privilege to take MATH140 with him this semester and understood the material 10 times better than when I did in high school. He teaches the material with such clarity that it is impossible to not understand what is going on (no matter how dumb you may be). What separates him from every other professor here at UMD is his teaching style. He is incredibly fun and engaging with the students. He always goes off topic with a joke or random topic at least once per class and it just makes you think to yourself ""this guy is so cool."" This may sound like a strange love story, but I guarantee you that if you take this class (or any class) with Justin, you will feel the same way. One day I saw him walking around campus in his red converse sneakers enjoying the awesome weather outside and I feel like that sums up who he is completely: the best professor I've ever had. Thank you Justin!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH130,"Justin is a really great professor! His lectures are really easy to follow, and actually makes the lecture a little more fun. He does everything in a way that is really easy to understand, but even if you still can't grasp the concept, he is always willing to talk to you after lecture, at office hours, or whenever. You still need to study, but most of the time, a lot of the problems are right from the old exams, or from class problems. I would recommend Justin to anyone who needs to take a math course.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH140,"Great professor.  Teaches on a good pace for everyone to follow and understand the content.  Justin gets his students well prepared for the exams.  If student gets a  bad grade, there's no excuse because Justin does everything he possibly could to get the students prepared for the exams.  A really good professor and I wouldn't want any other math professor other than Justin.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH140,I took Gulicks 140 and failed with a D. He is by no means a bad proff however. He just doesnt teach it the way Justin does. Justin thoroughly enjoys the nuances and implications of what he teaches and puts everything in terms that non math majors can understand. He starts with a non proof driven explaination and follows it up with the reasoning/proof. Drastically simplifies the overwhelming material in the book. I have not opened it once this semester. every question i've had could be answered by my notes. Ive definately needed to study for the exams but my work has been rewarded. The exact same amount of work in Gulicks earned me a D but i fully expect an A or B+ this go-round.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH130,LOVE HIM!!!!!!  If you have a choice definitely choose him as your professor.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH131,"I am certainly not a math person, but I actually did really well in Justin's class. He was such a GREAT teacher.  Studying for exams was very doable because he always gave practice exams so you knew what to prepare for.  He was also hilarious in class and just an all around nice guy. DEFINITELY take him if you can!!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH131,"Single best professor that I had last semester. I cant really add much beyond what the other reviewers have said. He is just truly that excellent. He really made math fun, and the only way that he could have made the class easier was to take the exam for you. Beyond that, he really explained things well, so that the stuff that I learned in AP Stat and AP Calc finally clicked into place and made sense in the context of the world. Try to get Justin as your prof if at all possible. ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH131,Im sure hereally donesnt need anyone else say how great of a teacher he  is but for anyone that is thinking about taking one of his classes think no more do it! He is one of the best teachers UMD has to offer!!,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A-,MATH131,"Took justin for 130 and 131 he is the best math teacher I have ever had, not only is he a really awesome teacher, he is soooo chill. the environment in class is fun and loose and he actually cares about his students! Take justin if u can he is the man!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH403,"Abstract Algebra was probably the most difficult course I have taken so far in college, but it was all worth it because I learned an incredible amount thanks to Justin's awesome teaching skills!

I had him for 246 last semester, so I decided to give this class a try because he was teaching it. 403 was a very tough course for me, but I'm sure I would have failed the class if any other professor had taught it. Justin lectures is such a straightforward, easy-to-follow manner and explains everything he writes of the chalkboard. He provides plenty of examples so that everyone can comprehend the meaning of theorems, definitions, and proofs he writes on the board. 

Unlike most of the professors in the math department, Justin actually cares about his students and doesn't brush them off. He responds to emails very quickly and has numerous office hours available if you need extra help, since many of us did need it. 

The exams were pretty hard, but straightforward nonetheless, with averages/medians usually in the 50s. He does give an appropriate curve so if you think you're failing, don't worry, all hope is not lost!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH131,"Justin was an amazing teacher. He took the time to explain things to you in an engaging way. His lectures were never boring and they never seemed as long as they really were. He always uses real life examples relating to our field of study so that we could feel as though we were actually learning something. He not only teaches you how to do something, but often teaches you why you are doing it that way and how the formula was derived. His tests were very straight forward and closely resembled the practice exams, so you always knew what to study. He was an amazing teacher who really loved to teach. He also computes your grade two different ways at the end of the 131 course and takes the higher of the two grades. I highly recommend taking Justin's classes, you won't regret it. ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH131,"Justin is a fantastic professor. He is extremely knowledgeable, but teaches in a format that is conducive for all students to succeed. He is extremely fun and all students actually enjoy going to his classes. The workload is perfect and his tests, quizzes, and group works couldn't be more fair. He is ALWAYS available for help outside of class. He is the best and funniest professor I have ever met. TAKE THIS CLASS. I promise you that you will do amazing (if you work hard) and you will actually want to go to class.

Justin clearly cares about all his students and I think the good ratings below me vouch that he is an amazing professor.

He gives sample exams to help you prep for his exams and he drops 3 quizzes and 3 group works. The homework is good practice for the exams so I really advise you do it. However, it is not collected/graded so it is not mandatory.

My only regret is not failing this class so I could take him again!!!


Overall, the best professor UMD has!
",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH131,"Highly recommended. Justin is one of the best professors - funny, engaging, and organized. He teaches in a way where even the most struggling student can understand. He takes everything step-by-step in a very organized and simple way. I did not even have to look in my book for help once. The only time I opened the book was when I was doing the homework problems. Also, the sample exams are very similar to the actual exams. ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH141H,"Justin is by far the best teacher in the math department.  He covers everything you need to know in depth and focuses on things that each class is having trouble with.  He takes it personally if his class does poorly on his exams and really puts in the effort to make sure they don't.  That being said, his exams aren't easy but aren't impossible either.  If you do the work and go to class you will do fine.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH246,"Justin is a great professor.  he doesnt make you learn all of the unnecessary things that the other 246 teachers make you learn.  his tests are basic and there is nothing that is on there to try to trick you.  they are basically the same as the practice tests he gives, which really help a lot.  the final exam was a little bit more difficult because it is a uniform exam and there are things that he did not cover, as far as i know. (i did not go to many classes at the end of the semester) he probably would have curved it, but he had taught the other material so well, our class did better than the classes who covered more material.  Overall, if you put any effort into this class, there is no reason to not get an A",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH246,"I had Justin for Diff eq, which on its own is moderately hard. He was different from wolfe who i had the semester prior in that he didnt just write up all the formulas on the board or derive them, he went through step by step to show you the methods you needed to know, and his tests clearly followed his lectures. im taking him again for math403!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH406,Great professor.  Made the material easy to understand.  I didn't even need to buy the book because the notes were so clear.  However his curve isn't really generous so don't expect a free A. ,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH246,"Great class. Exams were like the samples. Screw the MATLAB book...guides were always posted. Excellent professor who broke MATH246 down into the simplest of terms. As long as you do the MATLABs, do well on the exams, and take a decent amount of quizzes, you have the A on lockdown. The final was VERY similar to the ones on testbank.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH246,"Justin is a great professor.  MATH246 is a very hard class, and the book they give you is not very good at explaining, so lectures are very important when learning the material.  He was pretty flexible with missed MATLAB assignments, which were pretty frustrating.  Additionally there are weekly quizzes in discussion but he drops a few of them.  I missed many lectures and quizzes and still have a chance to get a B.  As long as you go to lectures and take all the notes, you will have no problem getting a good grade in Justin's class.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH246,"By far the best math professor I've had.  If you go to class and write down all the notes he writes on the board, the only time you will open your book is to see what the homework problems are.  Lectures are very organized, starts with the theory and then shows a couple of examples.  The best thing is that he only teaches what you need to know for the tests and the tests themselves are really easy.  He doesn't try to trick you with the tests and the sample exams he gives are very similar to the actual tests.  Basically, if you can do the sample exams you will know how to do the entire test.  Weekly quizzes are a pain, but he only takes the top ten.  MATLAB is similarly a pain, but he posts guides to the MATLAB assignments that are pretty much a step by step guide to the problems.  If you can, take Justin for any math class that you have to take.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH220,"The best professor I have had at UMD. If you are taking 220, you need to have him. He teaches the material so clearly and what he writes on the board is what you need to know. My roommate and I took 220 at the same time, and with his professor (one of the authors of the textbook) he suffered a lot and did so much more work. The webassigns are tough, but he dropped your 4 lowest ones. He is known to be the best 220 lecturer. I got an A+ and I know 5 other ppl in my discussion did too.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,MATH130,"Justin is amazing. I was considering taking 220 for my required calculus course, because it's the easiest. However, everyone raved about Justin, so I decided to take 130. I'm no math person, but he makes this class easy. I am definitely taking him again for 131!",414

I never have fallen asleep in this class because he makes class interesting.  Before the tests, he gives out sample exams which are really good to study from.  He's really good at clarifying everything that anyone might have a problem with.  I never figured a calculus class would be my favorite class, but Justin is awesome and I was pleasantly surprised.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,,"Explains everything in details. Instead of forcing us to memorize formulas, he taught us how to derive them. His notes are so good, you'll understand everything without even open the textbook(btw, I suggest the math department make copies for the hw problems on the textbook only for Justin's class. So that we don't have to spend so much $ on a piece of brick). Justin is great, and I completely agree with the person who said ""i once was lost but now am found!"" ......",414

We didn't even have to address him formally, he just told us to call him ""Justin"". He's so cool. I wish he could teach all of my classes. 

The material for MATH240 is still quite difficult, however. You have to pay attention and do the assigned homework. But Justin will help you as much as he can. TAKE HIS CLASS WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  ",414

Analyze the sample exam questions and try to think of ways of re-phrasing the questions as some of the actual exam questions can be a bit tricky.  Write down everything he says in lecture and you'll never need to open the book except to do homework problems.  Studied right off of my class notes.  I would definitely recommend taking a math course with him.",414

exams are very fair. he always gives 2 sample exams. u review one in lecture and one in discussion. the questions on the exam will be some type of integrated version of those questions. helps a LOT. MATLABs are also fairly easy. he'll help if u go to him for help on them.

I highly recommend his class. ",414

You follow the project description step by step, and use the MATLAB pdfs he provides on each topic to do it.

The grading scale is: Project 1 - 100 pts, Project 2 - 100 pts, Project 3 - 200 pts. After you submit a project, you have 1 day to fix the project in order to get full points, otherwise you can only get 80% of points. Because the grading scheme is lopsided, I got 100% on the first two projects, and got an 80% on the third project, giving me a 90% in the class. You can't see what errors you have unless you submit the project, so you only have one chance to redo the project.

His expectations are always very clear and his willingness to help students is unparalleled by any other professor I've had at this university. He seems to always know exactly what students are thinking. Because I've had him for three classes, I've seen how he adapts his style to best suit different types of classes. Especially for MATH410, where the material gives students a lot of trouble, Justin is so good at explaining things clearly and patiently.

wyss-gallifent,5,A-,MATH241,He is not overhyped. Best math professor I’ve ever had.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH401,"He is the coolest prof! No exams when classes moving online. And I have to say the project ""cryptography"" was so much fun to do. Such a surprise when seeing the original image was my id photo. Gotta give him 5 stars! ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH241,Just absolutely fantastic. Extremely accommodating and wants all of his students to do well. His lectures are amazing. We need more professors like Justin. He's extremely approachable and always answers questions. The amount of work that he assigns is reasonable and his matlab projects have some of the best documentation I've ever seen.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH401,"Very good lecturer, definitely lives up to his reputation. I don't really need to go into much more, the rest of the 100+ reviews tell the rest of his story. He is one of the best lecturers I've seen at UMD. If you can take a class with him, DO IT!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,"Perfect. Both live and recorded lectures. Exams were challenging, but they were take home.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A-,CMSC250,"Very hard class but his explanations made them doable. Exams were timed, but not on Zoom.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,,CMSC250,"Even though it was his first time teaching this course, he was very knowledgable about the material and his lectures were very interesting and helped prepare us for exams. ",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH206,"Justin didn't teach this class really since it was very much do work at your own pace. The class itself, especially if you have previous coding experience, is really easy and you get as many tries as you want for every problem. If you really wanted to, you could finish the class in a day, but for me it only took about a week and then I never had to worry about it again with was nice, but a lot of people waited to the last minute for deadlines and didn't have enough time to figure everything out, so the TA begrudgingly extended some deadlines",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,MATH241,Exams were all take-home during the pandemic. The lectures were very easy to understand and told you what you needed to know.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH206,MATH206 with Justin Wyss-Gallifent is one of the best one credit courses offered at UMD. It is a very reasonable amount of work and is not too difficult.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,,MATH401,"Amazing!! you could literally not know any linear algebra and get a B or better in this class. He gives you all the information that you need to know. Super nice guy, chill.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,A+,MATH206,"For MATH206, you have unlimited tries and instant feedback. This is probably the best 1-credit course at UMD, and is pretty much just MATLAB practice.",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B,CMSC250,Justin was a lifesaver during Zoom U. He was very knowledgeable and taught everything clearly. He was very good at engaging with his s tudents during lecture and they could ask questions. 100% the best professor in the CS/Math dept.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,CMSC351,Justin was fantastic. He clearly cared about us and wanted us to learn the material without truly worrying about grades. His exams were super fair based on what he taught us in class. The homework was tricky but he designed them so that we would learn the material and think about it in an abstract manner.,414
wyss-gallifent,5,A,CMSC351,"By far one of the best professors I've met at UMD. I was skeptical about joining his class as it was his first time teaching CMSC351 but he went above and beyond during the semester we were learning online. Justin spent a lot of time coming up with online class notes on his own time to explain difficult concepts, and spent a lot of time in lecture going through examples to help clarify content in the notes. Grading and exam timing-wise, Justin was very empathetic and reasonable with students.  Do the homework and review his notes before exams and you'll do well in the course!",414
wyss-gallifent,5,B-,CMSC351,"Made arguably the hardest CS class at UMD into one of the most interesting, useful, and honestly kind of easy class there is. Has such detailed notes for each topic that is publicly available (look up immortal umd for his umd website with the links to notes). These were absolute lifesavers and also just demonstrated how much he enjoys what he does, which is another reason why I gave him 5 stars. He is definitely one of the best professors I have ever seen. He is nice in office hours and with questions, but he will come across extremely blunt and sometimes rude in piaza and emails, but he explains that it's the fact he has so many questions and has to go through them. So I was taken aback at first since he seemed a little rude in emails and posts but he is really nice in office hours and just when he is able to actually spend time on answers. ",414

mohan_swarna,1,A,BSCI171,"During this Spring20 semester as bio171 lab has been online, this lady (as the head of the department) was a NIGHTMARE to deal with. She thought that by opening up a discussion thread she would be able to answer all questions students had in an efficient way. As students, we assumed she would be answering all our questions and trying to be as helpful as possible as moving a lab online is very difficult for students to manage as much as the TAs. But NO. She was of NO help when you asked a question in the discussion thread, and just tell you to refer to a different page, when we already didn't understand that page in the first place. Overall, I wish I never had the chance to have to work with this lady, as she was very bad with communicating and helping her students during this semester. Just horrible!",417
mohan_swarna,3,A,BSCI171,"Professor Mohan is strict and straightforward. She is not very helpful herself, especially since this class is asynchronous, so if you need help you have to ask a TA. The lectures are not that long but do not provide adequate information for the weekly quizzes. Overall this class is a LOT of work (labs, quizzes, lab reports) all for just 1 credit.",417
mohan_swarna,2,A,BSCI171,"The professor herself did not really engage at all especially in the virtual setting and she did not provide much clarification. On the flip side, the class itself was not too hard to get a decent grade although the workload for it was too much for a 1 credit class. The TAs I had this year was a lenient grader and gave good clarification on assignments.",417
mohan_swarna,3,A+,BSCI171,"171 was a very easy class to do online that requires very little effort. The lab simulations were kind of silly, and based on the lab manual, I imagine the labs would be pretty difficult to do in person. The quizzes were very easy, and you had to take them all twice, where the second attempt is worth more points (the questions are exactly the same though). Dr. Mohan didn't really make much of an effort to reach out to students; I don't even know what she looks like. Her pages on elms were also pretty cluttered, but they gave specific enough instructions.",417

mohan_swarna,1,A+,BSCI171,"The absolute worst professor at the University of Maryland. Completely unhelpful and way too much of a workload for a single credit. I would not recommend this professor and I only hope that she is fired soon, so that other students will not have to endure her pathetic teaching style and this horrible class experience.",417
mohan_swarna,1,,BSCI171,Mohan straight up sucks. She gives way too much work for a 1 credit class and never really offers help to her students. Its so annoying how a 1 credit class has more work than some of my 3 credit courses. Do NOT take her class if you have the option to enroll in other professors' bsci171 courses.,417
mohan_swarna,2,,BSCI171,"Excessive work and harsh grading, especially considering it's a one-credit class. She is very inflexible with due dates and other possible concerns; she's inconsiderate of student's time. In the online format, there is no direct interaction with her and she discourages it. Her lectures are somewhat helpful, but very dry and did not really elaborate much on the content found in the lab manual we are expected to read. In general, unhelpful and harsh. Would not recommend her class at all.",417
mohan_swarna,4,A,BSCI171,"I took this class online during Covid and I barely had any interactions with her. The TA's pretty much run the class, but an A is definitely possible. As long as you put in the work and actually take the time to watch the lectures, you'll do fine in the class. I ended the class with a 97% so it's very possible to get an A.",417
mohan_swarna,2,B+,BSCI171,"I didn't really have to interact with her much thankfully since it was mostly the TA's running the class but GODDAMN did this class suck. All Mohan is really good at doing is assigning large amounts of ridiculously stupid assignments and gives little to no leniency with them. I legit spent so much more time on this class than I did my 3 credit BSCI170 course. I swear sometimes it feels like she rambles on more about academic dishonesty rather than actually teaching useful shit in her lectures and explaining assignments well. She also talked a lot about how assignments were individual and you weren't allowed to work with people on them. And I think she should first start by teaching things properly so that students won't feel the need to collaborate in the first place LMAO. Thank god I had a super chill TA though. She was super kind, helpful and a fair grader.",417
carleton,3,A,BSCI207,"I took BSCI207 with Dr. Karen and with Dr. Eric Haag and I already aired my grievances about the class itself over in Dr. Eric's reviews but I just wanted to drop by here and say that Dr. Karen can teach neurons really darn well. I properly understood one unit in this whole class and it was the neurons unit and it was her doing. One review says her slides are long and this is true, I wish she just had more classes to teach her stuff. But she makes the slides so you can understand them when you go back through them, which is nice because that's pretty much the only way to study for this class from the fiery depths. 

Dr. Karen is very nice and I think a good teacher when she's not forced to teach the 207 material.Overall not a bad professor to have a course with. ",418
carleton,3,B,BSCI207,Wayy to much information on her powerpoint slides. Over 50 slides for each of her presentations for a 50 minute class. She's really nice but not a great teacher,418
carleton,5,A,,"Dr. Carlton is an amazing professor! She was happy to answer questions about assignments and really knows her stuff! She keeps things interesting and opens up the class mainly to group/peer discussions. This was a 2 credit class but I found the work-load very reasonable. Besides the few homework assignments there is a midterm project and final project. The final project was easy because you get to choose your own topic. All in all, this class is perfect if you like a small class size ~20 people, and a really intelligent, helpful professor.",418
carleton,5,A,,"For a 2 credit class, this class was more work than I had expected. We had homework assignments every week and a midterm and final project. The class was small, only about 20 kids. She's very enthusiastic about the subject, and tries to make lecture interesting. She's insanely nice and is always around to get help with homework assignments and projects and will basically walk you through everything. But overall, she's a great professor and really knows her stuff.  ",418
carleton,5,A-,BSCI207,"Wow, probably the best teacher I've had this semester and that's even though it was mostly asynchronous.
It's definitely not an easy class, you really have to work for it if you want a good grade. I don't mean that there were a lot of difficult assignments, I mean that the material itself is quite difficult, but I learned so much from it. She has each lecture (approx 50 minutes) broken up into 3-4 different smaller videos which is so awesome. It makes it so much easier do digest and absorb the material because of the smaller bite sized lectures.
Dr. Karen is also just very nice. She gets back to emails relatively quickly, and she also is just a very sweet person. I really enjoyed the class and definitely recommend it. I've heard that the BSCI207 teachers are generally very good, but Dr. Karen was just awesome.",418
lips_karen,1,B,BSCI363,"She definitely should be in research and not teaching. She is a pretty boring lecturer and does not get the class into the subject matter at all. In fact, I left with a bad taste in my mouth for conservation biology. 

The ""dossier"" projects were ridiculous. We all chose species to do our projects on from a list which she created. Many of these species had little to no information available on them. So many of the students who, by chance, picked a species with no information available, faced terrible grades.

Her exams were pretty bad too. They were  big 7-page packets of short answer questions. In the beginning of the year, she stated that her exams would focus on big ideas. But, in fact, her exams ended up being all the nit-picky details from her slides. Most of the class did horrible on her three exams and she had to curve heavily. 

The final wasn't too bad. Thats the good news. I think she used it to bring up grades. Pretty easy. But, I definitely would avoid this class overall if you can.",419
lips_karen,3,A,BSCI363,"So I ended up getting an A in this class, but I have to say that she was far from an ideal professor of conservation biology. She's not terrible, but I think she's more suited to research than teaching (not an insult, just sort of ironic). She's the only professor who I'd give under a 4 even though I got an A, which is saying something!

The subject material - as a whole - seemed pretty straightforward heading into the first (and only) midterm. I studied like crazy and ended up with a 52%. Funny thing is that 52% was right around the class average. She didn't take any blame for the incredibly long exam and said we could have studied more. Alright then. The final was a joke, lots of writing, but very easy overall. 

The major assignments (both were dossiers) weren't too bad. She graded them easily (as in the average was around 75%), likely because the midterm was so brutal. I ended up killing both dossiers which is why I got an A. There are also random homework assignments and in-class activities. Do them, because she retrospectively decided that since only half the class completed them, a couple would be for extra credit. I actually skipped ~30% the lectures (which she keeps tabs on yet doesn't count for points, which may explain why she had it in for me since I did well despite skipping all the time). 

Directions on assignments were vague, redundant, and unclear. You may feel like you're answering the same question over and over again - because you are. Just do it. She always started class early.

One more gripe. Any time I emailed her with a fair question about something, she'd give me an unnecessarily sassy response. I don't know if she just enjoyed sassing me, but they came off as sort of rude and uncalled for. 

To be fair, she was understanding enough to curve the class to make >80% an A. But trust me, that's not as easy as it sounds - in a class of 40 or so students, I was one of less than 10 to score above 80% overall, and probably one of 3-4 at most to have at least an 85%. ",419
lips_karen,1,B+,BSCI462,"Requires an insane amount of work for no reason. There's a weekly assignment to read 6-10+ articles and write a 1-2 page paper finding common themes between them. The lecture then goes over these papers, but the focus is on the methodologies. The midterm asked questions from the methodologies only - no bigger picture questions. Think ""what species of tuna did they catch"" instead of ""why was it important they caught tuna"". In a room of 16 senior biology undergrad and graduate students, the average was a 73%. There was no hint of a curve.

The in-class assignments are all the same - design an experiment within the narrowly defined example provided. Is your idea outside of the box? Not technology-focused? Did you not spend 90% of the write-up discussing how you would collect data? Too bad - instead you get a follow-up email asking you to review the assignment.

I still haven't learned anything about population ecology. 

The final project is 30% of our grade. Its due date was set two weeks after the rubric/description was released, and is absolutely insane. Prepare for a major lab report where you have to find and analyze data relating to species' population. A big chunk of students had their project proposals rejected, even after sitting down with her to verify they were on the right track. 

Her expectation that we have nothing else but this class is consistent and frankly there's a group of us prepared to fail the project. We cannot put in the time for a 15+ page lab report within the last two weeks of the semester.

She's nice in person, but should not be teaching. Avoid.
",419
lips_karen,4,,BSCI462,"I definitely think Lips has improved since the past reviews. I really liked the structure of BSCI462. Each week you read 3-6ish recent scientific papers and have to write a 1 page summary paper which is graded for completion. That took me about 3 hours each week. Then there are “activities” each week that I didn’t think were that useful, but they didn’t take too long and were supposed to be completed during class (usually had to finish them for homework). So about 4 hours each week of homework. 

Then there is the research paper assignment which is a huge chunk of the grade, but you have lots of freedom to do whatever you want which was fun. It took me about 30 hours of work on the paper. I did find it very frustrating that it was due so close to finals. 

The single exam was not too bad. Just study the concepts of the weekly papers and make sure to have lots of examples memorized. 

Karen Lips was very kind and forgiving. She loves biology. She wasn’t always super engaging, but most days were decent especially since it was a small class. I’d recommend BSCI462 with Lips. ",419
mclaren,5,B+,MATH212,"Math212 is the easiest class you will ever take. We go over addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but we learn why we use certain algorithms to solve them. Some of it is interesting, but people tend to fall asleep in her classes because she has a very soothing voice. Not too many projects, but there is a quiz every Friday. The tests can be tricky if you have trouble explaining math.  ",420
prestegaard,3,A,GEOL340,"I honestly felt like I had zero foundation for a lot of the info we learned.  Instead of learning a subject by starting at a fundamental level, learning terms, and building your way up to major concepts/conclusions, you were handed equations that you were told are true.  And then, you're told what the result means depending on the number you get out of it.  I wasn't learning for the sake of learning the subject - I was only learning so I knew what equations I was going to use on this week's lab.  Her class just felt like it was a graduate course dumbed down for undergrads where you're expected to have already heard of the main concepts and how we got there.  However, when it was dumbed down for us, it means that we were missing crucial pieces of info and derivations because we didn't see how we got to the conclusions.  Most of the info seemed to be taken from papers, and there wasn't a helpful textbook for self-study.

Labs are ridiculously easy.  You take measurements (usually just with a ruler or from the computer), and then record everything in Excel where you plug in your equations to make tables.  At the end, you then have a couple random questions that you're expected to answer despite having very little fundamental grasp of the topic; so you often have no intuition when trying to begin.  The labs were graded very generously, and made up most of your grade (other than a midterm, a final, and a couple (2-3) small group ""presentations"" of your labs for participation credit).  

Dr. Prestegaard is super nice and very approachable.  She clearly knows what she's doing in this subject, but her lectures are dry and the slides are a disorganized mess.  If you come in and do your work, it's a fairly easy A, if not a B.  But it was just a disappointing class since I was hoping for much more.",421
prestegaard,2,B,GEOL451,"Prestegaard was one of the worst professors I have ever had. Nobody learned ANYTHING from her course because she wouldn't give you any foundation for what she was ""teaching"". The only reason I gave her a 2 was because she grades so easily that even if you don't know anything you can pass her class. Hardly anyone showed up and there was no book for you to teach yourself.",421
prestegaard,4,,GEOL452,"Dr. Prestegaard is very nice and her courses are fairly interesting.  You can tell she is very passionate about her work, but that passion does not carry over well into her lectures.  She is a very lenient grader, but you do learn a lot from her class.  One complaint I have with her is she took a very long time to submit grades to ELMS and to return work back to students.  Other than that, Dr. Prestegaard was a pretty good professor and I did feel like I learned a lot without putting forth tons of effort. ",421
melnick,1,B?,,"She is a horrible teacher. Plus, the material is boring at best; it seems so freaking irrelevant to anything. Her tests are always hard, and after the first midterm she promised that an 80% or higher was an A overall. However, after the second midterm (where the average score actually went down from before), she stated that the 80s were now B+/A- territory, with the lower 80s being B+'s... This ""teacher"" goes back on her own word. I'm anticipating the final to be brutal as well, but maybe it's because I stopped giving 2 sh!ts after this horrible teacher. Currently have an 84%, but expecting that to drop even lower with the brutal curve. Honestly, take Grillakis if he's teaching next year. Apparently, he is faster paced but results in a higher percentage of A's. Melnick isn't cut out for 340. ",424
melnick,2,A-,MATH131,"In all honesty, I really regret taking Melnick. She made the tests 10x than the other professor's test, which was really unfair. She purposely designs her tests so that the average is around the low 60s, but when it came to final grades, the ""curve"" was only three percent, which is nothing comparing to the low average on the tests. She was decent at lecturing but honestly, the exams are so extremely hard that not even the quizzes and bioprojects prepared you. ",424
melnick,3,B,MATH131,"Unfortunately, I think she made what could have been a good class much harder than it needed to be. She is a very boring lecturer but thats just Math and you have to accept it. However, I feel like she could have done so much more to help the class learn and understand the material but she just didnt. She spends the entire class writing on the board and almost never turns around to see if people get what shes talking about. The only redeeming part of the class is the discussion. Even though theyre SOO ANNOYING because theres a quiz twice a week which means you have to go to every single discussion, they are super helpful. The only reason I was successful in the course was because I payed attention in discussion. Melnick is not the best lecturer out there, but i dont think shes the worst and if youre willing to work hard you can do well in the class.",424
melnick,4,A-,MATH430,"First off I must say that people must account for the class she is teaching when thinking about taking her class.  I took the upper level geometry course with her and she would occasionally complain about how bad her calc students were. She seemed to like us a lot more.

Lecture:
Was a little dry, but she gave good examples and explained things very well, things get a little strange when we get to non-Euclidean stuff which is weird.

Homework: 
Was hard. About 85% of the homework problems she made up, which were often pretty hard, if she assigned work from the book it was often pretty easy.  There were also three computer projects with Geometer's Sketchpad which were somewhat difficult.  

Office Hours:
Very helpful, in the beginning most people didn't know how to write a proof so she would more or less just do it for us.

Tests/Quizzes:
Quizzes were fairly easy, just basic test to make sure you are keeping up with the material.
The midterm was pretty easy too, the Final was a little harder because it had some crazy hyperbolic stuff.  
The layout of the midterm and final were something like this:
1) Some true false (no justification)
2) fill-in-the-blank proof
3) Do it yourself proofs
4) Some computational stuff or short answer


Grades:
25% = 12 Homeworks assigned on Friday due the next Friday (drop 2) 
10% = 3 Geometer's Sketchpad projects
35% = Final 
20% = One midterm
10% = 4 In class worksheets and 4 quizzes (lowest dropped)

Again this review should only be applied to her upper level classes.",424
melnick,1,,MATH140,Quite possibly the worst professor I've had at my two years at UMD. If a student asked a question in class she would sometimes not answer the question and tell them to see her after class or answer the question and not repeat the question so other students can hear it. She teaches proofs straight out of the book and barely goes over any examples.  Her tests are significantly harder than other Calc teachers.  She does not curve the class.  Avoid this teacher at all costs. I'm sure she knows what she is talking about but it just did not translate well to her students.  You know how I know this? All the familiar faces in my Calc class this semester.  I cannot stress this enough.  Avoid this teacher if you plan on learning Calculus.,424
melnick,2,B,MATH140,"Do not take her.
Just don't.
I only passed her class with a B because I had taken AP calc in high school. On every test that I took, there was always one question that I couldn't answer. So I lost 15-20 points automatically. She made everything so complicated and confusing. I only went to class because of the weekly quiz. Seriously, take anyone else.",424
melnick,1,B,MATH140,the person below me pretty much said it all. this was my third year of calculus 1 (2 years in high school and chose not to take the AP credit which i did earn). the way she tests is also harder than other teachers. my section learned everything in discussion from each other and the TA.,424
melnick,2,A,MATH140,"I can't let anyone get deceived by the two reviews before me. Melnick is awful. All she does is teach easy material in the most complicated way. She doesn't look at her students and just writes on the board whatever it says in the textbook, then several times during the class will turn around and give a look to the class as if we know exactly what she's trying to say. Everyone I talked about her class with, HATED her. Not one person in my discussion, which was the discussion with the highest averages in the class, said one thing nice about her. I HAD to go to Denny Gulick's lecture in order to give my chance of learning the material. Who cares if she baked us cookies. I'd rather be good at math than eat one cookie on the day before thanksgiving. The reason she doesn't teach well is simple, she goes over proofs but doesn't go over concepts well or sometimes even at all.",424
melnick,4,A,MATH140,"HAHA. I just read the review before me. Yes, she did bake us cookies for Thanksgiving, although only 40 people (around there) showed up for class. She is a very nice lady. She's very approachable. I have never been to her office hours, but she does emphasize that she has those hours opened for us. Yes, she does try to push the due date back for WebAssign if she hasn't taught the material. I have taken this class before and I will admit, I was pretty lost for the first few classes for some reason. It took me a while to get used to her teaching style. If you don't understand math, it may be a little difficult since everything seems to be definition. That made it pretty difficult for me at first. One person mentioned, ""she teaches like a wikipedia page"" and in a way, it kind of is. You need to get used to it. If you don't understand math, you really need to take notes. When you look at them later, they'll make sense. I have to admit, if you've never been a math buff, this will be a very difficult class for you. The lowest exam wasn't supposed to be dropped (it was supposed to be half the weight of a real exam), but since the average was so low for the third test, she decided to drop our lowest test grade. The class average on the last exam was pretty high, so you should be okay. Your TA will definitely help you if you need help. Having discussion twice a week is very tedious. You need to put a lot of time into this class. Good luck. ",424
melnick,5,A?,MATH140,"First thing I'm gonna say: ""She baked us cookies.""
She was a bit incoherent and awkward at the beginning of the semester, but that was probably because she was nervous or something. Anyway, I had already seen this material in high school, where I got a C. 
From what I've seen, she is incredibly nice to her students. She also tries to learn everyone's names. If you're having trouble, she will try her best to explain the material further. Unlike many other teachers, if she did not teach what was on the WebAssign, she will push the due date back (Ain't that amazing?!). 
One thing that was a bit frustrating though was that her exams were rather difficult. Everything on the exams is on what she taught, but the format of the exams is more difficult than those from other professors. On the contrary, she does give out practice exams (in the same format as the actual exam) and she did drop the lowest exam grade.
Overall, she was a pretty good instructor.",424
truman,4,B-,MATH310,"I mostly agree with the other reviews.  Kate is very energetic and knowledgeable.  She is normally very clear with her explanations (written and spoken).  With just those things, she's already better than most of the other math teachers I've had at UMD which were terrible at communicating course material.  What's scary is how much of the two textbooks she has memorized including questions and question numbers.

However, the class was too much work (for me at least).  If anyone is to blame, it's the math department's (ludicrously?) high standards.  If she didn't jam as much in as possible, then students wouldn't be prepared for Math410.  But, because there was so much material, she could hardly give us a brief explanation and short example for each topic.  So now after finishing the class, I feel like a Jack of all trades but master of none, and spending so little time on each topic means I'll probably forget almost everything (except broad topics) over the summer.  If there was less material, I could have mastered more of it, and it would likely stick longer.  But I guess for a cursory preview/review of a bunch of math topics, Math310 served its purpose.

It's funny how I put more way effort into my math classes (including Math310) than my 4xx level comp sci classes, and I get a B in math and A in comp sci (without even having to take the final in comp sci).  It's hard to say if comp sci is a bit too easy or if math is a bit too hard, but I'm leaning towards math being too hard.  It's great that Kate (and the other math teachers) drop a bunch of assignments and nudge grades so the class averages work out, but I'd rather they curve things around student performance than what percentage of the content they can cram into their brains and regurgitate onto paper in an hour.  For example, comp sci classes might set the B/C cutoff at the median for the class, and have the other grades based on standard deviations from the median. (median - 2(std dev) = D, median - 1(std dev) = C, median = B, median + 1(std dev) = A).  That means you have to do well compared to your classmates which is mostly independent of how well the teacher is at preparing the students for tests.  If the teacher's style doesn't fit with how the students learn (on average), then students can still do well compared to each other.  With the math department's system, if the teacher's style doesn't fit with how the students learn on average, then the students won't know all of the material, so they will do poorly on average.  So for math, a student can put in way more effort than others and get a better grade than most of them and still get a bad grade in the class if the class average was low (or a B when they put in a ton of effort).  Dropping and nudging scores helps, but it can still leave students that put in a ton of effort with a less-than-ideal grade. 

This problem wasn't as severe with Kate's Math310, but I wish she did something to curve tests with low averages, or did an overhaul to compare students vs each other instead of vs the textbook.  

In general, I spent nearly all of every Saturday working on Math310 homework and several hours throughout the week on the other assignments.  This felt overwhelming, but it didn't even feel like enough practice for all the content.  

So, if you have to rush and sacrifice quality for quantity to pack material into a class, is there too much material?  Does the math department want its 3xx classes to be more work than other majors' 4xx classes?  (Not to mention Math1xx and 2xx tend to feel like 3xx or 4xx classes).  And the icing on the cake is that taking CMSC250 places you out of Math310, but Math310 is unarguably much more difficult.  

That was a lot of complaining, but at least Kate tried her best and was better than other math teachers.  (Hmm, what a useful metric comparing people against their peers is).",425
truman,2,C,MATH310,"I don't know how you guys are bringing yourselves to give her high ratings. This class is an asinine waste of time and money; the last 30-40 percent of it is basically math410 REALLY poorly explained and rushed at a ridiculous pace. The rest of the class is really easy material and studying various proof techniques, which is actually fairly useful. 

She has really lost most of the class at this point with the 410 stuff. She assigns ungodly long homework assignments, and then she uses class time to go over the answers. This is great and all, but it leaves her with little time to explain the material for the subsequent hw assignments. My grades are suffering miserably because of the 410 rush, so I'm planning on getting a C at this point. I would say pick up a book like Daniel Vellman's ""how to prove it"", or the book for the class by Zhang, read over it, learn proof techniques, and avoid this stupid class all-together. I'm trying not to get discouraged from 410 because I really want to know it, but she's doing a very fine job of making me lose my interest in the subject.",425
truman,5,B,MATH310,"As has been said, Dr. Truman is great. Very conscious of students' needs. Exams are easy. Homeworks can be a bit daunting at times and only having <1hr office hours once per week doesn't help.

However, I found the class to be a bit of a waste of time. Roughly 80% of the course is easy. I'd say the other 20% is manageable at worst. The only reason I'm getting a B is because I missed one of the exams. If you're confident with your mathematical skill, I'd say either take 307 during the summer with her or don't take it at all.",425
truman,5,A-,MATH310,"Dr. Truman is a very energetic and knowledgeable instructor.  She is also an academic adviser, so if you take class with her she will know your strengths and really know what kind of schedule you can handle.  

Teaching wise she knows what she is doing and she makes herself available via email if you ever need extra help.  310 was a pretty easy class up until the last section when we started calculus proofs.  

She is definitely one of the best 310 instructors at CP, I am going to try and get her to teach me 406",425
truman,5,A,MATH310,"Kate was one of the best math instructors i have ever had. She went over anything and everything that was on tests.

go over your homeworks and any theorems that she says you have to know!! do the work and you will do well.",425
truman,2,C,MATH310,"Professor Truman is energetic and really cares about her class but unfortunately, that means having a lot of work and assignments. I took this class because I am pursuing a math minor and this class was more work than my major requirement courses. 
She does not post homework, exam, group work, or quiz solutions. The only time you can get an idea of what the solution may be is if you go to office hours or email her with an attempt to the question in which she will give you tips on how to get to the solution but never tell you the solution itself.
She would give a quiz a day after the homework was due meaning we wouldn't get our graded homework back in time to study for the quiz and see what mistakes we were making. Since there were no homework solutions posted, there were many ocassions where people would do poorly on the homework and the quiz because we didn't get feedback on time.
You can tell she cares about students really learning the concepts because this is an important class for MATH410 but that meant getting a lot of work in and outside of class.  
I personally think this class was too much work for what it is worth and multiple people dropped from our class before our second midterm (some of them dropping the course for a second time). We also did not have enough time to complete our midterms with more than half of the class not fully completing the exams.",425
truman,4,B,MATH310,"Probably the best instructor for MATH310. She would assign quick 5-10 minute videos containing definitions to watch before class when needed (not that often), otherwise we only had to attend live lecture. Most, if not all, of live lecture time was dedicated to student understanding of concepts and the homework. She would have two or three examples, but would build in time for students to ask questions or allow them to interject their own questions instead of the prepared examples. She was also really responsive and helpful on Piazza - you'd often get a response within 10 minutes, regardless of the time or day. Only reason that this a 4 and not 5 star review is the time allotted for quizzes and especially exams felt unrealistic since we were supposed to stop ~10 minutes earlier to scan and submit.
CLASS TIPS (Regardless of teacher):
1. Start the HW early! She doesn't give you a week to do it because she's nice (which she is), she does it because it takes a week(or at least a weekend) to do it! Seriously. Except for the first HW, I would consider it a godsend to finish a HW in six hours or less.
2. When studying for an exam, I recommend writing all the terms and definitions you learned that unit on two sheets of paper. That way you have everything you need to look at when studying in one place. Also very good when cramming. Also, it's obvious but bears saying, study by doing problems! Specifically, the problems you got wrong or had trouble with on HW and quizzes.
3. Start doing math at least thirty minutes prior to an exam. That way when it starts you're already in ""math mode"".
4. (This one might be more Truman and/or online-specific, but is still useful). Finally, you should be in a blitzkrieg mindset during this exam. You really do not have time for mistakes. If you read a problem and after thirty seconds still don't know how to approach it, SKIP IT.",425

ide_kayo,5,A,AMSC460,"She has a Japanese accent, and so she may be difficult to understand sometimes, but she is super nice when you ask her to repeat things. She even apologizes about the way in which she pronounces things sometimes. Homework is sparse and light, basically just there to make sure that you can in fact code what you learn in class. She gives weekly quizzes, but she basically tells you on what you will be quizzed in the class before. She gives a lot of chances to earn bonus points, and also if the class does especially poorly on a quiz, she allows people to retake the quiz. She is very understanding about the concerns of her students, and it is clear that her main objective is that students learn. She is a decent lecturer, but the textbook is very good, in case you're not a huge fan of her lectures.",430
frauwirth,5,A-,BSCI422,"He's a really great professor because he clearly cares about this material. Like the others have said, the material can get boring at times but he does his best to insert some humour here and there. He always, always answers question so raise your hand!

For the exams, the best way to study is to know those slides! A ton of the figures from the slides are from the book but I personally didn't think you needed the book. Pay attention to the things in red on the slides and you can also just ask him what he expects us to know from the particular slide and he will gladly tell you.

I also recommend recording the lectures, because the material can get pretty dense at times. Overall, highly recommend this class if you are pre-med. Kind of disappointed in the A- but he doesn't curve in the summer :/ ",433

Dr. Frauwirth also is reasonable about regrades and gives extra review sessions that are very helpful.",433

Great class, great professor. Put in the effort, and you'll get the grade.",433

As mentioned earlier, he tries to lighten up the class with his dull and dry sense of humour; it clearly never worked, since almost everybody was dozing off... LITERALLY. If u need a core requirement in LS, i am positive that there are better seminars you could take instead of this one.  ",433

The tests were not hard and there are old exams of his available that he recycles questions from.",433
paczolt,4,A-,BSCI222,"I think Dr P. deserves  5 stars but i'm gonna give her a 4 because she doesn't curve. Her lectures are fairly easy to understand and having the panapto videos as backup is really a life saver. I'll advice everyone to watch her panaptos thoroughly- her questions are only ever from what she talks about in class which is great. The exam review that the  TA's make is also really helpful.
I'll advice everyone to start studying a week before the exam. 
Go through the panaptos and take notes then go over the notes. Her exams can be kinda tricky, especially the multiple choice section, where she asks really detailed questions- You know those times where you read and you skim a section where you're like this probably won't come up on the exam. Yeah, it will come up. ",435
paczolt,5,,BSCI222,"Paczolt is really nice and does just about everything she can to help you out.
She posts her lecture slides, lecture summaries, lecture videos, pages to read in the book and problem sets, review videos made by her TAs, and old exams and their answer keys, so you can decide how you want to study. Office hours are also really great for getting your questions answered, and her TAs are absolutely amazing.
Her exams are tough but fair - Paczolt likes to focus on the concepts instead of specific details, so you won't really have to memorize too much. But her short answer questions will really test if you know the material well enough to apply it to a setting you may not be familiar with.
The gene lab assignments in discussion are easy points, Canvas quizzes are rather straightforward, there is quite a bit of extra credit, and her final exam reuses questions from the midterms that are rewritten differently so it's easier to study for. That said, there is no curve.
In short, she gives you everything you need for an A, so if you put your time into this class you'll get it.",435
paczolt,3,A-,BSCI222,"Paczolt gives you all the materials you need to succeed (this is for online). She gives you a clear schedule and what you need to do. She also gives you previous exams which are crucial(!!!) because they are very similar to the new ones, however, she barely mentions she has that resource out and I felt like it was underutilized.

I really appreciated this; however, her exams are very weird..her multiple choice gives more time than necessary but some questions ask obscure concepts she barely mentions in lecture but doesn't have on slides. Additionally, her topic videos are just so very long and IMO boring but that's just personal and not why I gave her 3 stars.

I think compared to the other BSCI222 teachers, Dr. P would probably be my least recommended out of them. She makes work and assignments from anything (so many assignments), and I think I spent the most effort in this class than any other class I have taken (including chem231/241). She also has a predetermined grade cutoffs and DOESN'T CURVE, and doesn't round either (90% is an A-, 89.999999 is a B+). This causes her to have a lower grade distribution than other professors, so I also wouldn't recommend her for this reason.",435

montesi,2,A-,GEOL200,"Montesi was an average/slightly below average professor. The French accent isn't a problem, it's his teaching style. The class was not inherently difficult, but the ""flipped lecture"" format of this class is just so that he doesn't have to give lectures. Students are expected to watch 5-6, 20-30 minute videos per week on the material. His grammar isn't great and there are a lot of typos in his videos. His test questions often had typos, etc and he would have to make like 5-6 announcements during tests to correct them. All the tests are in class, open notes, and online which makes them easy to do good on, right? Not really, sometimes he asks questions on the smallest details possible and the wording is sometimes downright impossible to understand. He gives kahoot quizzes every other lecture, same story as the tests here. There isn't enough time to read and think about the questions because kahoot only gives you 30 seconds to answer. 40% of your grade is a project on a geological event of your choosing (from a list) and this is done over the whole semester. Overall easy project but his guidelines can be vague and he'll take off points for stuff that he didn't say he wanted in the first place. I got an A- because like I said it's not inherently hard it's just really tedious and annoying and not worth your time for a gen-ed. TL;DR don't take this class.",438
montesi,1,A,GEOL200,"The flipped class format was a disaster. This flipped class format was supposed to make class more fun and help make learning easier and fun for students. For me it just seems like the professor is too lazy to actually teach his course. Class is just 1hr 15 min of the professor answering questions that students ask. Practically one giant Q and A, 2 times per week, that are also mandatory to go to since he gives out quizzes at the beginning of each class. Montesi also requires students to spend hours each week looking at videos of his online prerecorded lectures. Class seems like a complete waste of time since all of our learning is done by ourselves. 40% of your final grade is also determined by your group project which can either really help you or really hurt you. For me, it really hurt my grade since I got 2 non cooperative group mates and after complaining to the professor, nothing was done to help me. What I expected to be a relatively straightforward, and fun class to satisfy my gen eds turned into a extremely dull, and work heavy class that took up a large chunk of my time that I wanted to spend on other major related courses.

After attending lectures, reading the textbooks, and redoing all the hws, I opened the practice exam and it had ridiculously complex problems with what some material that seems irrelevant to this course. She expects you to have knowledge that was not taught in lecture or covered in the textbook. I wish discussion would have been taught better (the TA also admitted to needing help from the professor to do specific problems). She's probably a great scientist and researcher but is obviously lost in delivering material in a reasonable way to students. In addition to this, her syllabus states ""18 points will be counted through regular participation in AT LEAST ONE or more of the following: (i) Zoom class meetings, (ii) Slack discussions, or (iii) instructor office hours.""

To ""fix"" the particular issue of the exam locking out before time was up, she allowed students to turn in answers to the exam up to a week after the exam was administered. It was widely known that some students may have taken advantage of this system for the benefit of their own grades (Dr. Dodson acknowledged this as well), but she basically told her students that nothing could be done about the dishonestly. She did discontinue the use of that exam platform, but people who were academically honest really got the short end of the stick. Besides this first exam fiasco, other notable issues included a disorganized discussion, unhelpful ""practice exams"", and participation points that seemed impossible to accrue. I genuinely learned everything for this class from Dr. Schech's CHEM272 lab and the book.

Imagine that, a TA, who has the answer key, spends over half the discussion on defending the incorrect answer only to then backpedal and waste everyone's time.

dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"I am sure that Dr. Dodson is a great researcher and person but her teaching style and course set-up left me incredibly disheartened and discourage. I do not recommend her CHEM 271 at all. 

Lectures: Her lectures followed the textbook EXACTLY. Therefore, during lectures, all the practice problems are the basic/easy ones that only need one or two equations to solve. The homework and exam problems, where our grades are at stake, are much much MUCH harder. 
Grading: Her grading was very ambiguous, especially for participation. Since the class did not have many grading opportunities (just homework, exams, and participation), the participation weighed more heavily on everyone's grades. She did not clearly outline how the students can obtain participating points, causing many students to lose out on points that cannot be obtained past a certain time in the class. 
Exams: Dr. Dodson's exam setup is where I have the most grievance. Her exams were calculation-heavy (nearly 80-90% of each exam) but had no partial credits. She flat out rejected a student's suggestion of allowing students to turning PDFs for partial credits. I lost 14% on an exam because I calculated the last step in a seven-step problem wrong. On Exam 1, she decided to use Mastering Chem as the platform, which glitched like crazy. Then she was forced to accept late responses and granted everyone full credits on a couple of questions. Many students took advantage of this and the academically honest students were unnecessary and unintentionally penalized. In addition, she did not release our grading for the first exam so we could not even ask for regrades. To her credits, she did discontinue using Mastering Chem for exams. Her practice exams were not true reflections of the actual exams and neither were the practice dynamic module that she assigned. Her exam questions were also tricky and did not test students' understanding of chemistry topics. 

Tl;DR: Horrible lecture style. Horrible calculation-heavy exams that do not have partial credits. 100% DO NOT recommend. ",441
dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"Do not take her please for your mental health. Dr. Dodson is by far the worst professor I have ever had at UMD. My absolute greatest complaint is her lack of partial credit and inability to account for the rampant cheating that is clearly going on. The double standard and hypocrisy in her methods astounds me. Dr. Dodson makes 3-4 mistakes per lecture, the textbook is filled with errors, our final exam had 4 typos, but somehow it's fair that students are heavily penalized for the tiniest mistakes during the exams. Her grading methods are grossly unfair and in no way accurately assess mastery of content. Each question is worth a huge amount of points, and if we make the slightest mistake, we lose a large percent of our grade. If a student presses the wrong button on the calculator for the last step of a complicated math based question that takes multiple steps to solve, they get zero points even if they did everything else correctly. Or if they knew how to solve almost everything but couldn't get to the final answer, they still wouldn't get a single point. These questions can be worth up to 14% of our grade, which significantly impacts our overall grade. Dr. Dodson wouldn't even tell us which questions we got wrong on exam 1 so we couldn't even ask for regrades. She gets defensive when students bring up the issues (and I still can't think of a valid reason for why she didn't release correct answers to exams or why she won't let us scan our work for partial credit - considering many other chem classes online do both of these). Even if you have an excellent understanding of the material she taught in lecture and from the textbook, the exams are all or nothing so the tiniest mistake ruins your grade. 

Takeaways: grading did not adequately ascertain level of understanding, she wasn't open to suggestions, she didn't address student concerns, and the hypocrisy regarding ability to make mistakes was very unfair.",441
dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"If your goal is to learn chem, don't take this professor. We spent the first 5 minutes of the class talking about astronomy and I successfully learned more fun facts about outer space that I will never use again in my entire life. Additionally, the wealth of knowledge that I learned in the lecture was so tiny that the homework and 5 minutes of astronomy intro every day gave me more information on exams than her actual teaching. Quite impressive how disorganized she was and how often she would backpedal on her own notes due to so many mistakes. I'd rather just have someone read the textbook to me as that would give a stronger understanding of chem than paying attention to the disorganized and unmotivating lecture that she would give weekly. Take anyone else for your own good. ",441
dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"This is my first time leaving a review, and if that does not tell you something about how bad this professor is then my next paragraph will. Her lectures were extremely disorganized and littered with mistakes in almost every single one, and her practice problems/homeworks/other material were blissfully easy compared to the actual exams she would give, which were often absolutely absurd in difficulty and tested you on your ability to think through her tricks and lack of information rather than the content. She did not offer partial credit, which is insane when you could answer one 8 point question correctly aside from one part yet get no credit for your knowledge. When my friend asked her for help, she told her she was ""too busy"" and to ask classmates in the Slack chat...the final nail in the coffin was when she had four major typos on her final exam which cost students around 15-20 points, and then blamed students for not checking the Slack chat- when she was the one who wrote a final and didn't bother to look through and check that she made no typos! Aside from that, even the TA could not answer some the questions she asked us on exams, going so far as arguing with students for 30 minutes before later admitting he was wrong. If a graduate TA couldn't solve a problem, then it should not be used to measure the knowledge of undergraduate students. There is probably no curve in the class either, as she doesn't ever own up to her mistakes and realize her teaching style is not effective at relaying and measuring our knowledge. Do not take her if you want to learn and be tested accurately!",441
dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"The worst possible professor in the CHEM department, or in any department period. Just a couple of the things CHEM271 students had to endure this semester (buckle down this is gonna be looong):

1. The first exam was administered through MasteringChem, and had a feature where you had to lock in your answers before moving forward. No one was aware of that before taking the exam, so that, along with multiple other technological issues that arise, accumulated to a horrible exam. She then let students submit the answers FOR A WEEK after the exam, which I'm sure many students took advantage of - I think this speaks for itself. Then, we were told that the exam would not be dropped, and that no one hates MasteringChem more than her...ok.

2. We never received a practice exam that was analogous with the level of difficulty, or even represented the problems we would see in her exams. 
Also, not once were we given a solutions manual to any exam because she, in her exact words, would ""not be doing that."" Had questions about the first exam while studying for the final? Professor Dodson's exact words at Office Hours: ""You're just going to have to figure it out.""

3. No partial credit on a SINGLE exam. Your calculations had you off by more than 0.5 of the answer? Sorry bestie, that's a 0/5 on the question (on an exam out of 50 points)!

4. As mentioned in a previous review, we were told at the beginning of class that participation is accrued by one of the following: attending lecture, going to discussion, or posting in Slack. Then, halfway into the semester when the first half of the semester participation was tallied, and most students lost multiple participation points, we were told that we had to attend lecture AND go to discussion (which was not always helpful) AND/OR post in Slack. The expectations outlined in the syllabus was FAR different than the expectations she verbally set, which I have honestly NEVER encountered in any class in my time at UMD thus far. 

5. When she made a mistake while writing on the board and students pointed it out in lecture, she said ""Sorry guys, I'm being dyslexic"" twice. Disclaimer: she may be dyslexic in reality which we don't know, but if she isn't, that's an extremely discriminatory statement propagating stigma from a professor who is in a position of power. Many students felt highly uncomfortable from these comments. 
UMD prides itself in being an extremely welcoming school which prides itself on inclusivity, and I'm certain that comments like that do not fit with the school's moral tenants it strives to uphold.

6. THE FINAL. Oh, the final. She told us electronics was strictly forbidden on the exam, THEN makes MULTIPLE typos which affects the meaning of the questions, and posts corrections on Slack (which we were told not to access during the exam). When students mentioned this and highlighted the unfairness, she said ""the corrections were also available on the Zoom call."" ?????? The expectation for attending the Zoom call was ONLY if you had questions on the content, so none of us thought to stay in the Zoom call in the case that our professor makes huge mistakes on the exam (isn't that what proofreading is for???) Then, when this was brought up, she silenced us by telling us that people were still taking the exam, so we were to refrain from discussing the exam. Typical response from an individual who won't take accountability for their actions.
It's extremely unfair to uphold us to a standard in which we cannot make mistakes on the exam so we get no partial credit, then she goes and makes multiple mistakes in writing the final exam. Make it make sense. 

Just do yourself a favor and take ANY other professor - college is already stressful and Gen Chem is already a lot to handle, especially with having to take 272 at the same time (Dr. Schech is AMAZING at teaching that class BTW), so any other professor would honestly be better than what Dr. Dodson will put you through.

I'm sure Dr. Dodson is extremely knowledgeable in her field, and it is evident she is extremely passionate about the research she does. However, if UMD is interested in having professors that encourage students to develop a passion for Chemistry or who encourage students to learn/enjoy in the subject, I, along with many of my peers in her class this semester, would wholeheartedly suggest that you allow Dr. Dodson to sit out on teaching. She will bring nothing but misery to students, induce unnecessary anxiety, and instigate extreme apathy and negativity towards Chemistry as a whole.",441
dodson_leah,1,,CHEM271,"This is by far one of the worst professors I've had at the University of Maryland. During COVID-19 she was not at all accommodating. All of her lectures were set at a scheduled time, and you wouldn't have access to them unless you had a serious excuse. She doesn't take into account that other students have other responsibilities. (Not only that, but she posted them a couple of days before the final to everyone (who is going to watch hours of lectures, when she could have set them out every week like every other teacher)). Participation is HIGHLY subjective. I went to all of the lectures, discussions and commented on the slack, and yet I did not get the full credit! It takes a heavy hit on your grade. Furthermore, during our final exam, she made 4 typos on the exam and posted them on SLACK. I don't know any other professor that does that. Most professors send an email from ELMS, especially because the exam is CLOSED book and internet. She specifically states to contact her on slack if you have any questions or to join the zoom. How am I supposed to know there are errors on the exam? Her lecture style is horrible, and I personally learned more from the books. The homeworks are easy and do not set you up for her exams at all. Her reviews/prep work for the exams are USELESS! She makes them so easy but when you take the exam it's not at all what you expect. In addition, during the first exam, it was on mastering chem and for some students the exam glitched. She let those students turn in their work 7+ days later and yet all of the other students had to do the test at the allotted time period. This was totally unfair, and she honestly did not care. She is just really EXTREMELY confusing and just all around not a good gen chem II professor!  If you have the choice, take any other professor but her. ",441
koralov,5,A,MATH410,"Great professor, he was very thorough. People complaining about him are simply angry that they didn't get a good grade, despite not understanding the material.

Exams were fair.

Do your homework thoroughly, it's 410 that's what the class is about.",442
koralov,5,A,MATH410,"Foreword: reviews complaining about ""spending way too much time on proofs"" are obviously from people who have no business taking a 400-level course in the math department; upper-level math /is/ proofs.

So, Leonid Koralov: Super-nice professor, always smiling, lots of office-hours, will always stay after to help you through a problem.  Reasonable homework assignments, though they edge on the lengthy side.  Very flexible re: late homework if you miss a lecture, which is refreshing.

Very good lecturer.  None of the material in the course was at all difficult to understand if you showed up and paid attention in lecture.  All proofs done in satisfactory detail and explained lucidly.  He occasionally goes on tangents, but they generally cover material you'll see in subsequent courses and I've found that many of them were quite helpful.

He does assume a level of student competence with formal proof-based math in his lectures; if you are not yet comfortable with lectures consisting of definition -> claim -> proof -> repeat and little else, avoid.  If you are, you will find that he's one of the better lecturers out there.

Yes, he is a tough grader, but fair with partial credit.  Be sure to write your proofs cleanly.  Yes, his exams are fairly difficult (median grade was below 50% on both midterms, but most of this was due to many people in the class who simply were not ready to take a rigorous theory course).  Little-to-no curve, but he will bump your grade up if you put in a fair effort and show a good grasp of the material.",442
koralov,1,,STAT400,"I was in the same class as the other Fall 2011 students that posted and yes this guy to put it bluntly, sucks. I received an F in the class. It was my first semester at UMD, and I should have known better that in this school, most professors don't teach. I should have dropped the class rather than risk my gpa for this nonsense.  ",442
koralov,1,C,STAT400,"Koralov is by far the  worst professor I've had on campus. He spends way too much time going over proofs and half the time he realizes he made a mistake early on which screws up everything you just learned. The examples he gives in class do not relate to what shows up on exams and he'll generally screw up on explaining them more than once so don't write in pen. Actually you're probably better off not writing anything he writes on the board because its most likely wrong. The average on the first test was somewhere in the 40's and he couldn't understand why everyone did so bad. When I went to his office hours to ask about a curve he said there might be a small one, but he was ok with failing the whole class because obviously we didn't study hard enough. The only days I learned something were the two days we had subs.  Basically, avoid this man at all costs.   ",442
koralov,2,B,STAT400,"Ok heads up guys this man is a nice guy. Office hours are three times a week, however he is not a good professor. His lectures usually involve proving the material being taught then afterwards at max expect one lecture he will go over 2 problems. O and dont get me started on the exams....The first exam the average was a 35 out of 85 second was a lot higher 60/100. So now what happens with the hordes of people who are still in the class they suffer from a higher curve. (in Fall 2011 31% of the class dropped.....) So yea if you like proofs and don't mind learning on your own from the cryptic book by all means take this professor with unreasonable exams.... If you want an easy A... Look somewhere else .... ",442
koralov,3,,MATH410,"He is definitely a nice guy, and has office hours three times a week (more than any other professor I've ever had).
However, he does not curve at all, he barely gives partial credit, his exams are very difficult, and there were MANY people in the class who did not pass.  Furthermore, his specialty is statistics, so having him teach MATH410 was a strange decision on the part of the math department.  

I don't recommend taking this particular class with him if proofs don't come easily to you.  He tries to help, but he is only partially effective at doing so.  ",442
koralov,2,C,MATH410,"Nice guy, but pretty much just writes the book on the board.  Although he usually makes some insightful comments which I usually found made it worth it to go to class.  I dunno if he was just out of his element teaching MATH410 since he had only taught STAT classes before.  He is a really smart guy, but a hard grader and no curve.  Everyone failed the first test, and a lot of people failed the second one.  

He does want to help though, he tries very hard to help, but he just can't.",442
koralov,5,A,MATH411,"The best professor.

Exam grades sometimes rough (uniform distribution between 0 and 100) but fair.

koralov,1,B,MATH411,I took this course 2 semesters ago with this professor and received a B. He was not helpful whatsoever. Wrote word for word from the book with very few examples (no examples outside of the book). I essentially read each section and taught myself the material. Exams were difficult with absolutely no partial credit given. I would never take a course with this professor again. ,442
koralov,3,,STAT410,"He's alright. Doesn't put a lot of preparation into the course, but he's good at explaining stuff so that somewhat makes up for it.",442
koralov,1,,MATH411,Unreasonably difficult exams with no curve,442
koralov,4,A,MATH410,"He is a very nice professor. He is good at explaining things and he is pretty much always available as scheduled to entertain questions. He is very smart (he solved a question I was pondering for a week in around 30 seconds). 

Admittedly, he does ""teach out of the book"", in the literal sense: his lecture preparation consists of opening the book where we last left off and then lecturing some more. His exams are fairly difficult, but his grading for them is lenient if you demonstrate understanding of how to solve the problem. I also think his discussion on the beginning of the book (field axioms and natural numbers) was way too slow. 

Overall I would recommend him. For students who struggle more with the material I might not recommend him. For students who want their 410 experience to be extra spicy I would recommend Levermore instead.",442
koralov,4,A,MATH410,"He strictly follow the book in his lectures. Lectures are helpful, but is the same as reading the book yourself. 

His exams are difficult with little curve, it's usually the case that you can't complete the exams on time. The grade cutoffs are rather low, but not cover up the difficulty of the exams. If you know the material well but don't have time to finish exams, midterms are extremely horrible while final is fine.

He is extremely nice and knowledgeable, and he is very careful and serious as a mathematician(I guess).

Hints: some midterm problems are similar to past final exams, don't wait till the end of semester to study them. I saw many problems about Mean Value Theorem, seems like he like it very much. I saw a problem on exam about Darboux Theorem (you can solve it with MVT, but very hard), you can try that. ",442
koralov,4,A,MATH410,"He is a good professor. Usually he is available as scheduled so that you can ask him questions. Usually, his exams are somewhat on the difficult side, but he is a fairly forgiving grader.

It might be that he doesn't prepare the class with the problem solving skills to do the problems in the exam (as in our section over half the students ended up dropping the course). So his course is somewhat sink or swim. However, for 410 his cutoffs are very generous (85+ for at least an A-).

Overall I would recommend him to others looking to take this course.",442
koralov,5,A,MATH411,"Koralov is nice and is always available to answer questions. He'll try to go deeper into the material and make sure you really understand the course. His exams are fair, and although he grades them a bit tough, he will curve the class to make up for it.",442
koralov,4,A,MATH410,"Above average. Besides reading from the book, he only gives slightly different proofs. He gives a lot of homework. His exams are difficult, especially the midterms, because of a shortage of time. The final is easier, with double time and 1.5 times as many questions as midterms. 
A difficult question in midterm 1 is similar to a homework problem. Another difficult question in midterm 2 is related to the Darboux theorem (which is not included in the textbook).",442

rowland_todd,2,,MATH135,"Dr Rowland is a super nice guy and it pains me to say this, but he’s not a very good teacher. His entire class this semester seems very confused about topics that seem relatively simple. He presents the material using some weird program that has a lot of unnecessary code around the text. His notes are sloppy, disorganized and very hard to interpret. For the most part, the TAs were better at explaining the concepts in a lot clearer manner. However, he is willing to go out of his way to try to help you if you ask, and the grading is very lax. It’s probably difficult to do poorly in this class even if you don’t understand what is going on",445

He teaches using Wolfram Alpha/Coding and doesn't really demonstrate the problems well. He is disorganized and confuses himself during teaching.

He even ends up dropping one of the four midterms you have to do. ",445

Wonderful experience. ",445
rowland_todd,4,A,MATH141,Todd was a nice guy who in my opinion had decent lectures even though at times I seemed to have no idea what was going on.

isaacs,4,A,CHEM241,"How to get an A in Orgo II: do the practice exams. All of them. Do them. Especially for the final. I destroyed the final and it locked me in for an A (I was borderline B+/A-). GSS isn’t really helpful for orgo II, because Isaacs teaches DIRECTLY out of the book. His problems are almost all exactly the same from the book. Accidently YOLO’d too hard the night before and missed class the next morning? No worries, just read the book. (But don’t skip class a lot, you’ll get behind and screw yourself over) If you have questions go to his problem sessions, he’s really nice and receptive during them. This entire class is weighted on exams, so don’t slack on those. No homework, no extra credit. There are clicker questions, which help a tiny bit. But you have to do well on the exams, that’s the key!! Orgo II is just mechanisms and practice, so focus on that. Isaacs is a little dry as a professor, but better than Doyle, and not as good as M.S. but he tries to make jokes sometimes, and he’s excited about chemistry, which helps. (I've heard he's not the best for orgo I so avoid him for that course)",450
isaacs,2,A-,CHEM237,"Dr. Isaacs was not a good Orgo I professor. He even told the class that he hasn't taught the course in over ~10 years (at least he warned us...). Reading the textbook is basically required for his class. If you did not read the chapters before hand, you will probably find his lectures to be very confusing. After the second midterm, literally only half the class came to lecture because we all thought that the textbook was a better way to learn. 
However, the reason why I gave him 2 stars and not 1 is because when we got to spectroscopy and other Orgo II units, he became a better professor... as in like, he was able to clarify concepts more clearly. Unfortunately, spectroscopy was like... the last 2 weeks of the semester, so we basically had a ""decent"" professor for only 2 weeks.

Like the comments below, Isaacs is pretty boring and he does not have set office hours, which makes his class even harder. It is also basically required for students to read the textbook and do chapter problems in order to do well in his class. Anyways, if he is teaching orgo II, I think you will be safe taking him. But if he is teacing orgo I, I'd recommend enrolling in a different professor's section.

Oh yeah, another thing that kind of pissed me off was that Isaacs changed the curve on us. After taking our final, he told us that he had to give us a smaller curve because he said ""too many people would have gotten A's"" with his original curve.",450
isaacs,2,,,Lectures are extremely boring. He's often away and doesn't have set office hours. The only point of going to them is to know what to expect on the exams. The exams are manageable if you do the homework problems because he takes some problems directly and models many questions off of others. Only take Isaacs if you know you're diligent and will actually read the chapters before he goes over them and do the homework problems twice.,450
isaacs,5,,CHEM241,"Even a little preparation before class (skimming chapter) can go a long way.  What makes exams difficult are: the difficulty of the material, if you have seen and attempted the questions before and if you know what topics will be tested on the most.  Professor Issacs helps students by signaling what names of molecules will be tested and what mechanics are likely to show up on the exams.  He also takes problems from assigned problems in the book and synthesis problems from the book and from examples in lecture.  Professor rarely goes on tangents but when he does, they contain helpful advice.  

My biggest criticism of the 'course' book(Organic Chemistry by Loudon) is that in the solutions manual, molecules are not drawn using the skeletal formula.  The book has very long chapters so it helps to have a book that will cover the material in only a few pages (Try Schaums Easy Outline of Organic Chemistry).  For shorter and more coherent explanation of the topics, (Try Organic Chemistry as a Second Language II - Second Semester Topics).  PDF versions of these can be found using google :)",450

Isaac teaches the whole class by writing on the board which really helps me to stay focused, it feels like he is taking the notes with us. His exams are really tricky, but here are the keys to pass his class:

1. remember the names and structures of some really bazaar compounds, trust me he's gonna ask a few
2. Do almost all of the suggested problems. it even helps if you just look at the questions and the answers from the solution manual since most of questions
3. attend lecture and discussion. especially discussion... because it's really important although i felt like skipping a few times
4. spread the work out over period of several days, it is best if you stay on task but hey who gets on task all the time?
if you wanna cram i suggest you start cramming 3 days before the exam because they usually cover a lot of materials, that way you won't be stressed out.

I really like the way he talks, it is obvious that he tries to make it easy for people to understand a hard subject.  You need to work very hard to get an A in this class, but it is definitely possible, because a lot of people do bad simply because they do not show up to class and/or they despair b/c they've heard stories about orgo.
This is a very good teacher, and a good class, but you will have to practice problems every night.  I recommend Isaacs over any other Orgo 2 professor, because even though his exams are hard, he prepares you well for MCATs, med school, or whatever else you need orgo for. 

The averages on our exams were right about 50% each time, maybe a little below that.  His signature problem type is a ""box problem,"" where he will give you one of the three following pieces of information and you have to fill in the rest: reactants, products, reagants.
Other problems on exams are mechanisms (easy), synthesis (more complicated, but fun), ad nomenclature.  He always puts at least on mechanism/ synthesis from the book problems on the exam.  That is a really easy way to gain/lose 20 points out of 200, which is 10% of your grade.
The key is showing up to class, starring problems that he hints at, and doing ALL of the recommended problems before his weekly help session.  Ask him your questions at the help session, and you will do fine.  And DON'T leave anything for the last minute: learn things as he is teaching them, never take a break.",450

His lectues are boring because he doesnt use powerpoints, clicker questions, etc. I feel like the class would have been much harder had it not been for my TA (Bryan) However, with the help of a good TA you can expect a B, or if you work extremly hard an A in the class. Otherwise Dr. Issacs isnt very clear on what you can expect to appear on the exam. Class grades are based on a bell curve, so as long as you do better than the average you have a B.",450
isaacs,3,A,CHEM241,Very boring lectures but his exams are very predictable and fair. Doing lots of practice is the only way to do well. I would suggest him for orgo because it is easy to do well if you can recognize the patterns in his exams. Typical professor type that just lectures the whole entire time. ,450
isaacs,5,A,CHEM460,"I really enjoyed his course on organic spectroscopy. Spectroscopy was one of my weakest skills from organic and I came in without a background in physical chem or instrumentation, but he made it understandable. I think he did a amazing job explaining difficult material. He make jokes in class too. The discussion problem set presentations were intimidating, but gave us practice for presenting in the real world. The weekly homework was challenging, but he encouraged us to work with peers. The class also had guest lecturers for the NMR portion. In addition, he learned everyone's names and enjoyed answering questions. Overall, he's an engaging and passionate professor!",450
isaacs,5,,CHEM241,"Great professor. Also, Delaney is a great TA!",450
isaacs,5,A,CHEM241,"TEACHING: He's a decent/good professor. He teaches straight from the book, and has similar exam questions to the practice problems. He has structure to his lectures. He usually introduces a topic, goes over general concepts, then reactions with mechanisms and a bunch of examples - a simple lecture format. His handwriting and drawings are good. He gives clicker questions at the end of every lecture, so attend and be prepared.

PERSONALITY: He's very passionate about chemistry, and this shows when he speaks with excitement in lecture, which can be refreshing. He's very receptive of questions, and always takes time to answer after class and during office hours. He makes a lot of jokes. Whether or not you find them funny, they lighten the mood and make you feel a bit less miserable. He loves hemiacetals and daydreaming about being a nucleophile. Nice guy in general.

EXAMS: Some problems are straight from the book (but it's not worth trying to memorize). The format is usually as follows: 3-5 nomenclature, 3-5 concepts, 1-2 spectroscopy (must remember NMR and IR from orgo 1), 2-4 synthesis, 2-3 mechanisms, and 10+ reaction boxes (fill-in-the-blank with reactant or product formed), and maybe some other questions. Be prepared for this format. He makes an announcement on the exam format as well, so if this ever changes then don't worry - he'll update you.

STRATEGY: I did very well on his exams. My strategy may not work for everyone, but what worked for me was just taking notes during lecture - every example problem, every detail in a mechanism, all concepts. Organize your notes well. A week before exam time, I reviewed my notes hardcore. I took the time to understand, and not just memorize (although memory is very important). I didn't take practice exams, read the book, or go to GSS, but I do recommend this if you're not a great note taker. Book (for missed lectures) + practice exams will help the most.",450
isaacs,5,A-,CHEM241,"Ditto that one anonymous guy who gave an IN-DEPTH review of Dr. Isaacs on 5/14/21. Definitely take good notes and do problems from the book, he sometimes pull straight from there (at least when we were online).",450
grillakis,3,A,,"I took Grillakis' class when Justin's filled up and Margetis' class could not fit with my schedule. I was a bit weary about his class because he had a good grade distribution but very average ratings, which is a sign of grade curving. When I first sat through Grillakis' lecture, I immediately noticed that he was a peculiar small man with extremely neat handwriting. Grillakis speaks very softly into the mic, half the time I thought it was off the whole time, so make sure to sit close to the front. The beginning of the class is fairly easy, Grillakis breezes through the lectures without confusing many people and the first exam is super easy. However, as the class progresses, the material gets tougher and his explanations get vague. A lot of people stopped showing up to class and instead relied on the books and their TA's, and I did this a few times because his lectures got so boring and I didn't really understand what he was saying.The bright side about attending lecture is that he takes beautiful notes, the bad part is that he goes too fast with several jumps and hardly EVER provides examples. I recall once someone asking him to do a Stokes theorem problem and he straight out refused, we were all pretty shocked since this was one of the harder topics of the class. In terms of grading and his exams, he dropped the lowest out of four exams and dropped the lowest 3 quizzes out of eight. I realized there wasn't much curving, his grading system allowed for A's and B's. His exams have straightforward problems, but can be very physics related (which I didn't like much compared to others). Grillakis also does not wait to start lecture, he arrives to the room at least 10 mins early and once he cleans the board he looks around awkwardly and begins his lecture. This was difficult for people because if you are exactly on time, chances are he already started. Another thing is that he doesn't really follow the chapters of the book, for the last half of the class I was very confused with what chapter we were on but as long as you follow his topics and match them with the ones on the book, you should be okay. In short, his class required a bit of work. I got high B's on the exams and aced all the quizzes, and that allowed me to get an A. It is not impossible to get an A but you might have to work for it by going to office hours and going to discussion. My TA was Nick Thieme and he was great!",451
grillakis,5,A,MATH340,"I found Prof. Grillakis to be quite good for MATH340. 

His handwriting is incredibly neat, and in a small classroom his accent and volume is not an issue (I can't speak for the larger classes like MATH241). He tends to go quite fast through the notes, and sometimes it can be a tad difficult to follow, but he's very clear in office hours if you have any questions. 

There are 8 HWK assignments but he drops the lowest score, and his grader was pretty fair. They can be pretty long, though. There are two tests and a final, with your lower score counting for only a half test grade. Overall the tests are not bad, and cover what was covered in class. There are even some hints sprinkled in on some questions. 

He sends out reviews of notes and problems before tests, which are also in his impeccable handwriting (seriously, it's ridiculously neat). 

Overall he may not be great at lecturing, but I think he deserves five stars for his helpfulness in office hours, fairness of assignments, and the fact that in smaller settings the issues people had below (volume, accent, etc) are not really issues. 

I would gladly take another course with him. ",451
grillakis,5,A+,MATH340,"Grillakis is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. He is extremely smart and can answer any complicated questions within matters of seconds. 

I would definitely recommend taking Grillakis for any math courses. ",451
grillakis,5,A,MATH340,One of the best professors in UMD. Extremely nice in officer hours. Has the highest average for almost any courses. ,451
grillakis,5,A+,MATH340,"Grillakis is a wonderful professor. 

His lectures can be a little bit dry, but he knows the material front and back. We actually finished the material in mid-November, and spent the rest of the time going over applications to physics (his math area). 

His office hours are among the bast I've seen. He'll help you with anything, explain anything, with hardly a second's hesitation. He posts a good deal of notes and practice problems through ELMS. 

The homework is relatively tough, however he drops the lowest score of the 8. Tests are uncurved, however he counts the lower score for half (60 pts versus 120, etc). 

The grading system is fair - he apparently gets good TA's. Mine at least was a really nice guy who graded very fairly. 

In short, if you are the student who wants to take 340, he's the professor you want. 340 is theoretical, and so is he. It can be tough at times, because he doesn't always explain practically, but if theory is not too daunting, his class is amazing. ",451
grillakis,3,B,MATH241,"Poor lecturer.
Barely a curve.
nice guy.
hard exams
no more cheat sheets given.
find another professor",451
grillakis,4,B+,MATH241,"Very poor lecturer, I still go to lectures but I feel like there was no point going in the first place. I absorb very little information from his lectures. His notes are very unclear as well. I ended up going to D. Margetis's lectures instead, however Grillakis's test are EXTREMELY fair, he sends out a review before each test, and if you understand the review you should be able to get a good grade on test. He is lenient and easily awards you back points if you feel like you were graded harshly. ",451
grillakis,3,A+,MATH241,"He seemed very nice, but as mentioned before his lecturing was not great. He did focus on theory, but often gave examples. I still found them helpful and he did try to help his students succeed. My TA was great and reexplained certain topics.  His exams were for the most part relatively simple and fair. He curved the grades at the end.",451
grillakis,4,A,MATH241,"Very nice teacher, but a pretty poor lecturer.  I learned very little and ended up going to Margetis's lectures because I didn't have class during Margetis lectures. Grillakis is a very cool dude and will give points back on your tests if you think TAs gave too little partial credit. ",451
grillakis,2,B,MATH241,"Terrible, terrible, terrible lecturer. Not worth going to lecture if you have him. If you can't teach yourself the material or if you do not have good friends that can teach you, you are sunk. He is a really cool guy, and is pretty approachable, but he cannot teach..period. Now, his handwriting is neat, so his drawings are always clear, but even with that you can't follow him at all. He will say ""Is it clear what I did here"" a good thousand times a semester, even though it is evident a handful of people have any idea what he did. Do yourself a huge favor and waitlist Justin, even if 40 people are ahead of you. ",451
grillakis,2,,MATH241,"DO NOT TAKE GRILLAKIS!!! He is a very nice person who wants to help you out, but he is probably one of the worst lecturers that you will come across at this University. He focusses way too much on the theoretical side and the stuff that is not important. He also focuses on teaching the concepts rather than doing examples. He will also make you fall asleep with his monotone voice. 
On a positive note, Tests are very fair and pretty easy. He is also VERY generous with regrades. In fact, this semester, he only gave out 550 points tests (4-100 point midterms, lowest counts for 50% and a 200 point final) and matlabs. This kind of sucks because there are no HW or quizzes to buffer your grade. The thing with Calc III is that it is pretty much easy to teach yourself all of the material. I guarentee you, IT IS NOT WORTH COMING TO CLASS IF YOU HAVE GRILLAKIS!!! It will just be a waste of your time. Try to get a good TA, or be prepared to teach yourself the material. ",451
grillakis,4,,MATH340,"Make sure to pay attention. It'll be hard because his accent is kind of rough, and he speaks relatively quietly. However, he has incredibly neat handwriting and very nice diagrams. However, since this is multi-var calculus, it can be just gibberish if you copy down with no context. His graders were kind of harsh so make sure not to make careless mistakes. His tests were very fair, and he drops the lowest one too! Make sure to do the homework and not procrastinate. The weekly homework assignments can become huge, but they'll help with tests. I regret not trying hard enough on the homework since it would have helped me prevent harsh deductions from my test grades from simple mistakes.",451
grillakis,4,B,MATH241,"Grillakis is a professor who really knows his stuff and thinks that you should be just the same. He'll often charge through problems in a satisfactory manner BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN KEEP UP. He doesn't always explain his steps and goes through his explanations very methodically but that's not a bad thing for everyone. Keep in mind that he's also kinda boring.
Personally, I almost never understand a thing he says in lectures and I usually just wait until the discussion section the next day to learn. I had Maxx Cho as a TA and you really had to be an idiot not to understand the material he teaches. 
Overall, the class itself isn't too difficult. There's a lot less material than there was for MATH141. No HW, no quizzes, 4 (or 5) Matlab assignments, and a couple exams. ",451
grillakis,5,A+,MATH340,"While I found Grillakis's lectures to be a bit boring, I was always impressed with how well he know his stuff.  The moment anyone asked a question, even a difficult one, he always knew where they were going and could answer it satisfactorily.

In general, his tests were pretty fair.  Most had only two or three questions, with several parts each.  Each part of a question built up to some sort of conclusion (""What can you draw from this?"", something like that), which made the questions a bit easier.  As long as you could figure out a few of the parts, you could often fill in the blanks for the rest.

His general policy for the course was to drop one of our five tests.  However, after accidentally putting content from Chapter 6 on our Chapter 5 test, he quickly agreed to drop that one as well (and actually seemed to feel bad).

Grillakis seems like the type of professor that actually wants all of his students to succeed, and is very willing to do his best to make sure that happens.",451
grillakis,5,B,MATH411,"Grillakis is a well-dressed man who knows this class in and out. Lectures are spent proving theorems, often differently from how the book does it, which can be helpful.

Grades are the average of your homework grade (lowest of 7 dropped), your midterm average (lowest of 3 dropped), and your final exam score.

Homework is often either plug-n-chug application or intense proof that you may need to go to office hours for help on. However, there is at least a week and a half between due dates, so you always have enough time to complete the assignments. 

Exams are basically a practical application of the material you learn. He does not put dense proofs on exams, but rather he tests your basic and superficial understanding of the techniques you learn in class. Exams can be tricky, but they are very doable and very much test your understanding of the material.

Just as was said in the review below, this class is essentially a multi-dimensional extension of 410. Some of the concepts are very arcane and difficult to grasp (example, proving Stokes Theorum and boundary proofs with Jordan Contents), but Grillakis is great at explaining these concepts.",451
grillakis,3,A,MATH140,"He's an OK professor overall. My semester was the first that he taught 140. His lectures definitely aren't a thrill, but they are worth attending. Based on my friends who took other professors for this course, Grillakis is definitely one of the fairer ones in terms of the makeup of exams and the scheduling of WebAssigns. He's also a very nice and understanding guy. 

PS: I found the reviews given by other professors before exams to be very helpful for studying.",451
grillakis,5,A+,MATH462,"He has the neatest handwriting in the world and his lectures are very organized. He explains concepts fairly clearly. Homeworks typically took a long time to finish, and quizzes were usually relatively simple compared to the homework. However, his final was much harder than anything we had done for homework or quizzes so you really have to know your stuff for the final.",451
grillakis,5,A,MATH241,This professor has some of the neatest chalkboard handwriting I have ever seen. This really help when taking notes and drawing 3D diagrams. He is a good professor even if he does talk in monotone most of the time. He is very kind and is very approachable if you have a concern about your exams. He allows one page of notes on the exams (except the final). The matlab assignments are incredibly easy as it is mostly just copying and pasting what they give you. However some symbols don't copy over correctly and might throw an error if you don't catch them. Overall he is a very fair professor and would recommend him. He not the best professor I have seen but he is a pretty good one.,451
grillakis,4,C,MATH241,"Lectures honestly put me to sleep. He wasn't engaging in the material, which made it cumbersome. However, he makes up for this with his grading policy. He drops your lowest of the four exams, and we had eight quizzes and he dropped the lowest three. Homework is graded on completion.

A flaw in his style is that he allows one page of notes for every exam, but not on the final. So if you train yourself to rely on the notes, your setting yourself up to fail. 

Average Professor, student-oriented grading system. ",451
grillakis,5,A,MATH241,"Compared to most of the math professors at UMD (excluding Justin, of course), he's great. He's clear, concise, and relays the information in the book well. He doesn't just recite the text verbatim.

He has very good handwriting, making the 3-d concepts easier to understand. Has a slight accent, but doesn't get in the way. He does tend to be a bit monotone and he likes to start every lecture with, ""Let me remind you...""

For the exams (excluding the final), he allows you one page of notes for reference. If you have a good TA, there's no way you'll less than ace every exam.

He's extremely friendly and very laid-back when it comes to grading and his approach to teaching. I chose him as my faculty adviser this semester, and he helped me greatly. If Justin is unavailable, take 241 with Grillakis.",451
grillakis,5,A+,MATH241,"Great class, great professor, easy A.

He drops the lowest 2 of the 12 quizzes, and the lowest 1 test of the 4 chapter tests. He also curves this class, which makes it very easy to get an A.

His TA's aren't helpful at all, however, the homework is mainly graded on completion and if you have a nice TA this should be a guaranteed 100 points.

The first three tests are easy, but the last test is very hard, so if you need this grade you may want to study for the last test.

The final is okay, but luckily I needed around a 60% to get an A in the class, so no worries.",451
grillakis,3,B,,"Professor Grillakis is a really nice guy but for my calculus 1 class he wasn't very effective. I had trouble understanding what he was telling us because, as a calc one student, I had very limited knowledge of calculus. He's obviously brilliant but his teaching style wasn't ideal for students who were just learning fundamentals of calculus. His exams and quizzes were unpredictable but he did drop one of three exam and two of twelve quizzes. He taught us much differently than other 140 classes so when it came to the uniform 140 final, our entire class was lost.",451
grillakis,2,A,MATH241,"Grillakis is a very nice guy, but not a particularly engaging or effective teacher. I went to every lecture hoping that for once, I wouldn't have to pull out my textbook and start taking notes on my own. Unfortunately, he never failed to nearly put me to sleep, and I would sit in class reading about whatever topic he was making unnecessarily complicated.

Everything I learned was from my TA or from the book. Other than that, the quizzes and tests were very fair, as was his grading policy. ",451
grillakis,3,A,MATH411,"He seemed like he knew what he was doing, the tests and homeworks were pretty standard, but he was really boring. He talks kind of softly into the board, and pretty much writes everything he says down (which is also all in the book). There was nothing particularly terrible about his class, but it was hard to pay attention for the whole 50 minutes, especially when the proofs were complicated. ",451
grillakis,4,B,MATH411,"Grillakis is an effective professor (not great, but definitely a competent teacher). He will answer your questions directly when asked, and his proofs are generally easy to follow, though there are exceptions (not that this is his fault, as some of material is simply a bit complex to get in one go during lecture). His tests were well written - they were definitely short enough to be completed in an hour, but the questions were thorough in covering the content being tested. Also, the questions ranged in difficulty, so the exams weren't devilishly hard or too easy (though the exams certainly *seemed* easy when I was taking them, because I wasn't paying enough attention to some of the subtleties of some questions).

Also, importantly, Grillakis was very responsive to student concerns about the shifting homework schedule after the week of snow, and the work load was never impossibly heavy.

MATH411 isn't too bad, basically an extension of 410 into multiple dimensions. You can pretty much expect to do as well in 411 as you did in 410.",451

The exams have been mostly fair...just do the suggested homework problems on the syllabus.  ",451

There is homework every week and 3 tests. The homework can be challenging sometimes but Dr. Grillakis is very helpful and alot of students go to him weekly for help. He also was very clear for what we had to know for tests.

For MATH461, he teaches in the largest lecture hall in the Armory, without a microphone, and speaks at barely above a whisper. For comparison, there's some guy who sits in the fifth row or so who always eats takeout during class and his chewing and burping is louder than Grillakis's lecturing.

Furthermore, Grillakis is unclear about what material he teaches simply because it's cool to know and the material he expects us to know for exams. His lectures seem like he's just rambling and he does not indicate clearly when switching between topics. He also does very few practice problems. Although some of the TAs are actually very good, Grillakis does not communicate well with the TAs about what material is being covered in lecture and what might be on the test. We also were not provided with sample or practice exams. It's impossible to know the difficulty, length, and even what concepts will be tested on the exams. Like another review said, the grades are only based on three midterms (lowest gets dropped) and the final. Later in the semester, he informed us there would be MATLAB  assignments for extra credit. If you want to learn the material on your own and get a pretty easy A, take Grillakis. Otherwise, avoid Grillakis for MATH461.",451

his grading is the nicest part, and there was extra credit as well. but as of now, the averages for the tests were high 60s, and then one below a 50%. he literally put a problem that was from the next chapter on one of his tests, and even with the generous grading the class should still be technically curved, considering that if you got the average on every test you'd have a 60% in the class, which is barely passing by most standards(C-).

Her powerpoints are very difficult to follow, however, and you should show up to every class because she will often cover material not online or in the textbook that will be on the exams and a several times she assigned in class worksheets to do for points. Andrew Keppel was my TA and he was great. He really seemed to know his stuff and recognized that the labs don't actually take 3 hours so he didn't make us stay the full time. We never stayed more than an hour and a half. Easy class but don't underestimate the exams! Only complaint is about the lecture assignments that she assigned very late into the semester. ",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"best professor for bsci106
take this class with shofner

she is so nice and approachable
she engages students in a 300 person lecture
her powerpoints are very helpful for exams
if you can get past exams from a friend you are golden
she is really nice in office hours

make sure you do good in lab
hopefully you have a good/ easy TA",452
shofner,3,B,BSCI106,"Shofner is definitely a nice professor! So nice that if you started cursing at her, she would still genuinely love you.

However, I went into the class thinking that it was going to be an easy A, which it really wasn't because the exams were pretty difficult. She tests on details usually and essays are graded harshly. 

I had Melissa Meyer as a TA and she was just some girl from Texas. 

So, just run away if you have Melissa. One of the worst TA's I ever had in college. Get one of the guy TA's. One thing I learned in college is that male TA's are so much nicer and chill. They don't take off random shit points on reports or tests. Andy Simpson is the coolest TA for this class. 

In the end, Shofner is nice, so study hard. I had orgo and physics with this class, so obviously I was going to spend less time in this class. 

Anyways, my advice is that good luck. TA's matter so much. ",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"I loved Dr. Shofner. She is extremely knowledgeable on the topic, but not in a show-offy way like some professors - she uses her knowledge to make lectures really interesting with lots of examples and stories. Thought grading was fair - one test gets dropped out of three. Don't buy the book! She only tests on things in her powerpoints and things she talked about in lecture. Attendance is not mandatory (no clickers), slides are posted online. She's one of the nicest and most personable professors I've had. Would definitely recommend moving around your schedule so that you have her.",452
shofner,3,,BSCI106S,She is nice professor and all but sometimes I don't bother going to lectures because she posts them all online anyway. Tests are fair (lowest midterm dropped). I totally expected to get an A in this class  and was at 90% but I got a 85 on my final and ended up with a B+. The final exam wasn't even that bad but I feel like the TA's were just looking everywhere for places to take off points.,452
shofner,5,B,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner is so nice and definitely willing to help her students. She is the one professor whose class I didn't get an A in but I can still say that I like her as a professor. That's saying a lot. Anyways, in terms of grading, take the lab quizzes (and lab practical) serious [they're what brought me down to a B]. For the exams, study every little detail on the slides and you'll get 100%'s on the exams. She drops the lowest of the three non-cumulative exams though. Lab is easy, not much to say there. ",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner is wonderful. She is so nice and very approachable. The lab for this course isn't too difficult, either. As long as you study hard and turn in all of your assignments, you should expect to get an A. I thought BSCI106 was easier than BSCI105. If you're going to take 106, take it with Shofner! ",452
shofner,5,,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner is a really nice professor, and if you have to, or want to take this class, I definitely recommend trying to take it with her!!  She puts all her powerpoint slides online, which is nice, and you can tell she really enjoys teaching.  She even provided an extra credit opportunity as well as review sessions for the exams.  She's very approachable and very on top of everything (administratively, ELMS, etc.).

At the same time though, unless you are a biology major, or really pick it up quickly, this class might not  be easy.  Especially at the beginning, I found the material to be somewhat challenging.  You should go to lecture and be prepared to study, ask questions, go to lab, etc.  The nice thing is that Prof. Shofner allows you to drop one of the three exams (not including the final, which is the fourth exam).  Another nice thing is that 20/150 points on the final are based on a zoo/Museum visit, so it can help you out a bit (should be an easy 20 points).

   The laboratories aren't too bad, just make sure you stay on top of the quizzes and really pay attention so you can do well on the assignments/practical. Don't procrastinate and don't be afraid to ask your TA questions!!!  I was lucky and had the head TA for my discussion- that's the only part that's kind of out of your hands-yours might or not be good.  A good part of the labs is that they compliment lectures (or follow them very closely), so it can be helpful in learning the material.

 All in all, I would recommend Dr. Shofner! She's a nice professor and makes the class interesting.  Just be forewarned, the material might be somewhat difficult.  DON'T GIVE UP though...keep working hard and learn from mistakes/previous exams...I found that I got used to what to expect on the exams and the class got a less difficult as it went along.  Good luck!!",452
shofner,4,A-,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner is surprisingly a good teacher.  It's hard to tell because she doesn't seem very confident, although knowledgeable.  

If you're going to take BSCI106, take it with Shofner.  She doesn't even require that you buy a clicker!

Her tests are fair; she drops the lowest.

This class is a lot of work [memorization/studying for exams] but it's not impossible to get an A.

Don't buy the books.  Only buy the lab manual.

Brian Davidson, aka Bubba, was the best TA.",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner has to be the sweetest professor ever! She has a very pleasant demeanor, and her lectures usually tie in some interesting topic to keep us engaged. Don't assume this is an easy A because it is most definitely not. You still need to put in the effort for an A. Nothing is really difficult to understand, but there is a ton of info covered on exams. A lot of people come in assuming it's easy and end up doing pretty badly. 

Some notes about the class:
1. You'll benefit a lot from lectures. She emphasizes certain material that will help you a lot for exams. Some exam material is ONLY covered in lecture.
2. She posts up a study guide outline before each exam. Use this as a guide to help you figure out what to study--it'll cut down on your studying immensely. I got As on all the exams by just using this outline to help me write out a study sheet. Her exams only cover what's outlined, but you still need to refer to the slides to get the major details. Make sure you study the relevant slides!
3. Don't buy the book. Waste of money. I literally opened it once and read 1 single paragraph in the beginning of the semester. Never opened it again and still got an A.
4. Other reviewers are spot-on about being careful of the TAs. Consider yourself lucky if you have a good one. If you're not so lucky, don't be afraid to challenge a grade or even challenge the TA. My TA often gave us wrong info and didn't seem to understand what we were doing in lab half the time. Go to Dr. Shofner if you have to.

Overall, great class, very interesting material, very kind and fair professor. Highly recommended!",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"I personally think Dr. Shofner is the nicest lady ever.  She is so sweet, and I could not stand when the students in lecture would talk over her or start packing up while she was still talking, because she's not the most assertive or authoritative figure. She is a really good  teacher and knows her material extremely well.  The tests were pretty straight-forward and you do get to drop the lowest of 3.  My TA, Brian Davidson, was really good! He was laid-back, an easy grader, and always let us get out of lab early.  Even though he was so chill, he still managed to get the material through to us and explained everything very well.
I really enjoyed this class and highly recommend Dr. Shofner!",452
shofner,4,A,BSCI106,Dr. Shofner can be a bit boring and monotonous sometimes but she is a good teacher. Her tests are extremely easy; so easy that in my class there was no curve cause most people's grades were very high. You do not have to go to lecture cause she posts everything online. I definately recommend her...oh and watch out for the TA's.,452
shofner,1,C,BSCI106,"Dr Shofner is extremely nice and a good lecturer but the TA's can be impossible. If your TA is Jenny Allen, DROP IMMEDIATELY! Save yourself the bad grade in a seemingly easy class",452
shofner,3,B,BSCI106,"This class is really difficult, much more than it seems. Lots and lots of ecology and evolution terms/concepts. Shofner is fine, nice enough, and seems accessible to students after lectures. Make sure you pick a good TA for lab though, especially one that is accessible, because that makes a big difference (mine wasn't and it sucked). Shofner doesn't really use the book, so you probably don't need to buy it.",452
shofner,5,A,BSCI106,"Dr. Shofner is incredibly kind.  She is very interested in Biology and you can tell from the way she lectures.  All important facts from a test standpoint are based on her lectures, so there is not much need to read the book, although it is helpful.  

Lab is incredibly easy, but can be a lot of work at times.  Only one lab report all semester, but some writing assignments too.

Overall great biology class and very kind and talented professor.",452
shofner,5,,BSCI160,"I definitely recommend Shofner over other professors. She is passionate about the materials as well as teaching. Very approachable during class and office hours. She does go through the slides VERY quickly and would sometime skip materials that would be on the test later. She does drop the lowest test grade and her tests are like most other BSCI 160 tests.
BSCI 160, like many BSCI courses, has a lot of materials to memorize and to understand so be sure to keep up-to-date with the material. ",452
shofner,5,A-,BSCI160,Nice professor. Exams are straightforward. ,452
shofner,2,,BSCI160,"Dr. Shofner is a very sweet person, and it's obvious that she cares about her students and is really invested in the subject. That being said, I took BSCI160 with her in Fall 2020 and it was one of the worst classes I took that semester. The class was unfortunately asynchronous, and while I can't blame her for that decision, she did not adapt to the format well at all. For one thing, she did not have a syllabus, which was incredibly annoying, and instead had all material on her lecture schedule on ELMS. The problem with that is that this lecture schedule wasn't very well put together, it was incredibly disorganized and made it difficult to locate assignments sometimes. She would also sometimes post more than one lecture video for the day, exceeding the time that the class was originally meant to be. She hosted office hours during these originally scheduled class times, so you either had to watch her lectures before her office hours (and sometimes she wouldn't even upload the lectures until late in the afternoon) or hold onto your questions until the next time she had them. The lectures themselves were even more disorganized than her lecture schedule. They were not structured well and seemed to jump back and forth between broader topics and more specific topics. It's hard to truly explain how bad these lectures were, but it was very frustrating trying to take decent notes from them. The bulk of the assignments for her class were LAs (Learning Activities) and her worksheets. The LAs were super, super easy group assignments that were never an issue, and the worksheets were larger assignments that were probably better at teaching the subject than her lectures were. She didn't have any quizzes and would often have extra-credit activities that could get you a few additional points. She also technically assigned textbook reading, but since the textbook is an overall biology textbook, the readings would often go much more in depth than what was being taught in the lectures and didn't always line up that well; I stopped reading the textbook about a month in. The class had three midterms, with one being a week before the final exam. She drops one of the midterms and the final exam is optional, which was nice. Definitely study for the midterms! They were genuinely a little challenging. 

Again, she definitely cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I somehow got an A in this class when I was bordering between a B+ and an A- for almost the entire semester, so it's not a difficult class to succeed in. But, if you're very ""Type A"" like me, this class might also prove to be pretty frustrating with how extremely disorganized it is. I'm literally an Evolutionary Biology and Ecology major, so I find it impressive that she managed to make me hate this class.",452
shofner,1,A+,HONR289A,"Like the other reviews say, she is a really sweet person. Makybe it was because this class was online or because it was an honors class and teachers usually have a more laid-back attitude towards honors classes where it isn't as important as regular classes, but this class was a hot mess. 
In the first phase of the class, an ungodly amount of terms and biology information (it was like reading from a medical journal) were thrown at us in asynchronous lecture. However, that wasn't very concerning, as all we had were reading quizzes. We would also review the material during our weekly meeting on Zoom. After the first few weeks, however, these Zoom meetings started to simply degenerate into students talking politics. They also stopped teaching us new material, but we (at least those of us who weren't bio students) never really learned anything in the first place. Finally, we had the final project. First, it required an extraordinary amount of work, far more than any other group project I've ever done, especially when you look at the fact that we were expected to do it in just a week or two. Additionally, the requirements for the project were unclear and constantly changing. The requirements and guidelines were split onto two different documents instead of one ELMS page for some reason, and they were completely unorganized without being split into sections. While this may not sound that bad, it meant that if you wanted to know if something was or wasn't in the rules or required, you would have to read through BOTH documents COMPLETELY. There were also often contradictory instructions and requirements in the documents, and the teachers themselves (two teachers, but Dr. Shofner was the one in charge) were unresponsive to questions, taking a few days to respond by email - and even when they did respond they often said ""I am not sure. Let me ask the other teacher"". Sweet teacher, but a dumpster fire of a class.",452
shofner,5,A-,BSCI160,"She is such a sweet person. I got very sick with COVID last semester and she was more accommodating and worried about my well-being more than all of my other professors combined. Her tests are pretty straight forward. Definitely go to her office hours if you have any questions, especially on the exam. She is very understanding.",452
colombini,3,A,,"I do not recommend taking this class.  The material is very interesting, but the class is taught in an extremely unorganized fashion.  Professor colombini did not make any real effort in preparing students for the exams.  When you try to ask him a question, rather than explaining the concept, he will keep asking you questions to try to get you to get to the answer yourself.  Its really hard to get any information out of him.  What's worse is that most of the topics discussed cannot be found online for in a text book, so you're really stuck.  I would avoid this class.",453
colombini,5,,,"He's a great teacher. That said, BSCI426 is a hard class. Well, maybe not for everyone in the class. The grad students seemed to know everything. But Colombini did everything in his power to make sure I succeeded.

If you take membrane, do the following: HW! Redoing HW! Emailing him for helping on the HW! Not study for any  of the exams since they're open note and based on the HW!

So if you like HW! take this class. ",453
colombini,1,C,,"Do your grade a favor, take another professor. Trust me!!!! He is very bad with teaching. Seems to lack knowledge in physic. Half of the class dropped. The class rather covered some chemistry, which was out of topic. He is a very unfair grader and rude. I submitted my report/complain to the departmental dean ",453
colombini,1,,,"Wow, he is horrible. He changed the policy in the middle of the class without telling any students. Seemed to be somewhat discriminatory when comes to grading. Avoid his class as much as possible. I thought he understood material but he doesn't. His lecture materials were out of sync from time to time. And he's lazy too. ",453
colombini,5,A,,"This is a great course and one I would highly recommend to anyone as an elective.  
It is really intellectually stimulating. A lot of the information that is taught in the course does not have a convenient wikipedia page or other source from which you can teach yourself. So it is important to go to every class and pay attention and take lots of notes. 

The format is hw due every week (30%), 1 paper(30%), and 1 final (40%). 

The homework is not too hard if you pay attention in class but it can be close to impossible if you do not. Regardless, Dr. Colombini is very helpful during his office hours as long as you put in some effort beforehand. I ended up having to go to him almost every week. Although the homeworks are hard, he lets you redo them to correct your mistakes so at the end of the semester you should have a 100% for your homework grades unless you are lazy. 

The paper is not too bad, the directions are just to give an opinion on something new for one of the topics given in class. There is no requirement on length. Mine ended up being about 8 pages but as long as you include all necessary information you should be fine for this.

The final can be easy or hard depending on how much effort you have put in to taking notes and making sure your homework is correct. It is open notes so print out computer notes and whatever else you might need. I felt it was a very fair test because I was able to find the topic the questions asked in my notes. Overall if you understand the hw then just review the topics not covered by them and you will be fine. There are actually not too many outside the hw so it shouldn't take too long. ",453
scull,5,A,BSCI437,"Friendly engaging professor and very fair exams (all free response). Low workload - little to no homework, no projects, one extra credit assignment. ",454
reaka,1,,BSCI106,"HOLY CRAP! After being taught BSCI106 by this lady, I wanted to kill myself. I am a good student but don't expect to get a good grade if you are. It's all about sheer memorization in this class. 

Now her teaching style=sucky
If you have sleeping issues, her class is a sure cure for insomnia. It consists of her reading word for word off a powerpoint (which is poorly laid out). She does not engage students. In fact, I feel as if I did not pay for a teacher in this course. I paid for the powerpoints. 

What a waste of money!! I seriously do not know how this lady is allowed to teach here at UMD. Do yourself and the University a favor and do not take one of her classes. You'll be sorry you did.",456
reaka,2,B,BSCI106,"total idiot. Doesn't know what she's talking about, forgets terms, doesn't define vocab or summarize the info you need from your reading or clarify and doesn't know how to proportion her time over harder subjects versus easier subjects. She falters over READING her slides to you, copies definitions from wikipedia onto her notes, and her power points are more like a textbook, where you read and fish out what's important. Extremely unorganized, and doesn't compromise with you. I you have another exam you can't reschedule and you want to reschedule her's, sucks for you. I've only had her for two weeks, but since this is the summer term, two weeks is alot and trust me, you DON'T want her. Half the stuff I know is from AP Bio, not from her teaching me.

And it's true - she isn't responsive to emails and tells you that she ""never received it. End of story."" When you ask a question in class, she goes partially answering your question, beating around the bush and talks over you so that you can't clarify your confusion and frustratio nwith her. She's obsessed with her research and really doesn't give a finch's beak about the class. ",456
reaka,2,,BSCI106,"I thought it would be a good idea to take BSCI106 over the summer to get ahead with my classes, and is was def a good idea except for one thing, Marjorie Reaka. She is one of those teachers who cannot teach and expects you to know everything. She gave a great amount of biased information from her marine biology studies, which was very boring to say the least. She is a very boring person herself. Her lecture are very dry and she has no sense of humor. She does not help out her students and she does not care for her students. Honestly, maryland has her around so they can boost their research standings, as she is more of a researcher than she is a professor. She has a very deep monotone voice that can put the even most avid listener to sleep. Overall, to say it nicely, one of the worst decisions in my life was taking her class. Please do not waste your time. Oh btw, she doesn't curve... at all. ",456
reaka,3,A,BSCI106,"Her class was pretty boring. Especially since I had her in the morning. Her tests are solely based off of her powerpoints so make sure to pay attention to those. Reading the book definitely helps, but it isn't required to get a perfect score on her tests. Her tests are definitely some of the easiest compared to the other professors'.",456
reaka,1,C,BSCI106,She was very boring and didn't work well with students concerns. It seemed like she could have known what she was talking about but she didn't convey any of it to the class. Avoid taking her at all costs. ,456
reaka,5,A,BSCI106,"Hands down. She is the best and easiest professor I have ever talk to or associate myself with. I had an average of 96.5 in the end and did not even try at all. she tries to make her exams trickery but does a bad job on it. IS TOO EASY. STRAIGHT UP FROM POWERPOINTS. PLS, DONT EVER READ DA TEXTBOOK. Guys igonore every comment below me and take her. you will never regret it. Promise you.",456
reaka,4,,BSCI338B,"Dr. Reaka knows the material extremely well, which means that this course covers ALL major marine animals from a billion years ago - which REALLY means that the lectures are very very dense and often contain personal diving stories. 
Only about 20% of the class showed up to lectures because she posted her complete slides online. 
Grade-wise a B isn't difficult as long as you study for the STRAIGHTFORWARD midterm and cumulative final. There was an optional paper if you wanted to raise your grade - NOT extra credit, the weight of the midterm and final were decreased so that the paper would be like a third assignment. 
I would highly recommend this class - probably one of the easier bio courses.",456
reaka,3,A,BSCI106,"The good:
1. Very open to questions, especially after class.
2. Notices those who ask questions and try hard; this actually helps her determine your final grade. If you have 88% and have been trying very hard, she'll throw you a bone and give you the A.
3. Exams are fair - if you've been attending lecture and paying attention, then you'll certainly get the A. 
4. Hands down, knows her stuff

The bad:
1. Overly detailed lectures make studying a living hell. Make sure to approach her after class to sift through the crap and get the meat of the lecture. 
2. Beware: you'll know more about her days in Berkley and her Cornell-attending, lacrosse playing sons than you've ever wanted to. 
3. She's boring. VERY boring. 

Overall: avoid if you can, but don't be too bummed out if you get her. ",456
reaka,2,A,BSCI106,"people aren't lying when they say she is boring.  my notebook is filled with doodles just because I could not pay attention.  She talks about random stuff during lecture and tests you on stuff entirely different.  If you have to take her, she's not so so bad.  Don't waste your time reading the book.  Most test questions come from the lecture notes and the other questions come from out of no where.  But the book probably wouldn't help you anyway. Also, make sure you do well in lab because it'll really pull your grade up in the end.  ",456
reaka,1,,BSCI106,"I had a bad experience with Reaka as my bsci106 professor. She only responded to 1 out of my ~10 emails and her excuse at the end of the semester was that she never received any of my emails. She also said at the beginning of the semester that she was going to curve the class, but in the end, she decided not to. Well, she did curve 2 points but that doesn't help at all. 2 points is like a 0.02% additional to your grade. I needed 5 more points to get a B (had a 78.8%), but she refused. She is monotoned and is so boring. Avoid her if you can.  ",456
reaka,2,B,BSCI106,"The course content was appropriate and on topic and I did learn from My TA and lab section. However, I did not learn from the lecture portion of the course. the instructor went off topic a considerable amount and did not follow the syllabus that was given at the beginning of the semester.

freidlin,3,,STAT410,"He is not the best teacher. He just write on the board. He does not follow the book. He gives quizzes however when he realizes that everyone did poorly on the first one, he made the quizzes into take home quizzes. His reviews for midterm and final are not helpful at all. However He is not unreasonable. He is very helpful and also He is not a harsh grader. He didn't not fail anyone on the midterm. He allows a formula sheet on the final so it is not that bad. His final and midterm are very much like his take home quizzes and homework. If you know how to do the take home quizzes and homework, you should be fine in the exam and final. ",457
freidlin,1,B,STAT410,"Avoid this professor if possible. He does not use electronic devices, all his material is handwritten, make terrible mistakes all the time, etc, etc. He teaches a concept closely related to Markov Chain before introducing what random variable is. He also has very, very high expectations for students (though he put little effort on helping students meet his standards), so the problems he gives are not solvable if you only look at the textbook and his notes (we have a student pursuing her Ph.D., even she needs to google when doing the hw problems). He could not explain the concepts clearly as well. Everyone is struggling, All in all, don't. ",457
freidlin,1,B-,STAT410,"Incredibly difficult class and was definitely treated more as a graduate course than something usually taught in undergrand. Things were constantly wrong in the notes and were never fixed, leaving students vulnerable to many mistakes on the exams which had averages in the 40's. I ended up with a B- in the end and I really don't know how, course was near impossible. No electronic presence at all for the course, spelling errors on our official syllabus. Very very disorganized and not to mention the fact that he most times doesn't explain the necessary precursors to the content he's going into. Jumped straight into random walks and brownian motion before even touching distributions like the exponential and poisson. Don't take his courses, they're a living nightmare.",457
ricotti,4,A,ASTR340,"Pros: Knows what he's talking about, gives out copies of the lecture, very friendly and always willing to answer questions. Curve was set first day of class (100-85 A, 84-70 B, ...) and homework was 40% of the final grade. 

Cons: If you aren't super interested in some of the topics of the course, then some lectures can be pretty boring. The math involved in the homework gave some people problems, but overall it really was not that difficult if you could use the given equations and can convert units (high school level stuff).

Overall: While I did enjoy the course a lot, it is ""designed primarily for non-science majors"" and therefore didn't go as in depth with physics as I personally would have liked. Regardless, I learned a lot and recommend both the course and the professor.",458
ricotti,4,A,ASTR415,"While I can't say Dr. Ricotti is a bad teacher, I can't say he's excellent either. As a person, he is excellent. Really, really nice and funny, and even brought us cookies and cake a couple of times. While his lectures are extremely dry, that may have been just because the material, computational astrophysics, can be pretty dull when you study the algorithms closely. He is an extremely fair grader, however. He is very willing to give extensions, and really tries very hard to give good grades. The homework was very difficult, but again, that was probably because the material is difficult.
To summarize - if you are interested in the subject, take his class. Otherwise you may find lectures to be very boring.",458
machedon,3,B,MATH246,"Machedon is a decent teacher. He tends to drone on and is extremely vague in his explanations in class. I don't feel like I gain very much from going to lecture. That being said, his expectations are very reasonable. His tests are fair, as are the quizzes. You can learn it all from the internet and by doing the problems from the textbook before the tests. He puts a relatively small emphasis on matlab, which I appreciate because I've never really been taught matlab and feel like i have no idea how to use the software. I'd suggest you take matlab if you want to put minimal effort into this class and you don't expect to gain much of an understanding of the material out of the experience.",459
machedon,2,B,MATH246,Machedon's lectures are boring and his accent and handwriting can be hard to understand at times. The tests were pretty difficult and the textbook was hard to understand and in my opinion focused too much on derivations rather than how to get solutions to problems. He does curve the class about 10% which is helpful.,459
machedon,3,A-,MATH246,"Overall, not a great lecturer, he goes through the material quite fast and is not great at explaining things. Using the online notes by Levermore supplemented with Paul's notes plus the occasional patrickJMT/Khanacademy youtube video was enough to get me through most of the material. I also had a fantastic TA (Jacky Chong), definitely take him if available, he's kind of eccentric but really knows his stuff! His tests are quite fair not easy but not impossible either.",459
machedon,4,B,MATH246,"Taking Diff Eq with Machedon, I only went to class for his assessments (3 quizzes, each a week before each of the 3 midterms), and instead of going to class taught myself from the online textbook. Before each assessment, he sends out an email reminding you about it, which sections it covers, and usually a few hints about its content. They were all fairly straightforward, though the midterm with LaPlace was bad, an average of 59, the other two exams had B averages. He curves significantly at the end, 10% for me. The matlab was not bad, and only was on one exam, unlike some other Diff Eq teachers. Paul's Online Notes are great for when the textbook is too wordy.",459
machedon,4,A,MATH246,"I loved taking DiffEQ with Machedon. He is really friendly (the friendliest professor I've had). While the material can sometimes be unclear during lecture, he is approachable and you can clear up the issues you have. 

Some of the differences in reviews may have been the different TA's that we had. I had Summer as my TA and she was fantastic, and always explained everything clearly that Dr. Machedon may have been unclear on. Those with the other TA may not have had that and thus were unable to clarify a few things. 

As far as tests go, they are on a curve and fair for the most part. The only issue is the one trick question he likes to put on each test. If you get lucky its only worth a few points, but on one for us it was worth 20/100 and very few people actually knew what to do. ",459
machedon,4,B-,MATH246,"Dr.Machedon isn't the best teacher, but he makes up for it. His grade curve for the class is awesome! Automatically, above a 50% is a C- . Then the rest of the grades are determined based on how well the rest of the class did. Averages were real low for first 2 tests, but the 3rd test was ridiculously easy. But by choosing to take Machedon, prepared to get demolished on the final because the other teacher makes up the majority of the test. As a person, Machedon is probably the nicest math teacher, in which he is always willing to help you and clarify things. So if you don't understand somethin, just stop  by his office during office hours and you'll be good.",459
machedon,5,A,MATH410,"Dr. Machedon is a great professor! He is really nice and always approachable. It is clear he cares a lot about teaching, and enjoys congratulating students for getting certain problems correct. He teaches very well, and often presents material in a better way than the book. His tests tend to require true understanding of the material instead of memorization, though many questions are ""tricky"". The test averages for 410 were very low, but he understands this and curves the class fairly in the end. I would highly recommend him as a teacher. You will end up understanding the class material extremely well at the end of it all.",459
machedon,3,B,MATH246,"This review is more about Machedon's class than his teaching.  I never really went to lecture so I can't say whether or not he was good.  But he drops 5 out of 15 hwk.  We had three exams and one was extremely easy, the other two were fine and definitely doable.  I would advise taking his class if you usually don't go to lecture because you can teach yourself from the book and still get a good grade in this course.",459
machedon,4,B,,"The folks below me who are complaining about machedon this semester have nothing to complain about. I am a B student in math (I have even got a C once a long time ago) and this class is a joke. His first and third exam were a total joke, almost 10 people in my section got a 100 percent on the last exam(me included, and I bombed the second exam). His second exam (the one with laplace) was killer for me, but overall this class is very easy. One of his problems on the second exam was even from the homework! (and yet stupid people like me still missed it). Machedon is an incredibly nice and funny professor (Love his accent!). Those who fail in this class don't belong in engineering. I see people who get 7% on the first exam, where they ask basic diff eq calc (separable equations). idiots. Master laplace transforms and everything else should be a joke.  ",459
machedon,2,A,MATH246,"I have to agree with the review below this one. I am a good student who is pretty good at math (Usually get A's) but as a teacher Machedon is not very helpful. He is a nice guy, but he doesn't really teach important concepts.. he gets more caught up on the details of the material.

I have never really intentionally skipped a class before this one, but reading the dense book was more helpful than attending lecture. And that says something especially for a math textbook. I wouldn't recommend him as a professor for this class :/",459
machedon,2,,MATH246,"Machedon is a really nice man, and he seems to genuinely care about his students, but he is not a great teacher. 

His handwriting is difficult to read and his lectures are not very well-organized. He runs through lessons very quickly, and I personally find it difficult learning Diff Eq from him. I have watched Khan Academy videos and have had to read sections in the textbook (which is mediocre) repeatedly just to catch up to him.

I'm also really confused by the comments about his tests being really easy. I guess he's changed his test format since then, because his tests are so ridiculously and unnecessariy complicated. They're long for a 50-minute time period, and the questions are far from direct. I've done all the homeworks and recommended practice problems and I feel like they don't help me with the tests at all. For the first exam, the average was around a 67/100. He does curve the tests, but if you score under a 50, you're out of luck. This seems like a fair grading system at first, until you realize how much the TA's don't like giving out partial credit. 

",459
machedon,1,B,MATH240,"If you have a TA named Safa, switch out immediately. He grades homework very randomly (takes random points off for not having ""neater handwriting"", when both he and the professor write in hieroglyphics). The class overall is not too terrible, but there was no curve and I got a B because of the TA's grading based on neatness and quantity of the work you show as opposed to the correctness. If you turn in 10 pages of work, you get a perfect score. If you turn in 2 pages, but get the right answer, you lose points for ""not showing enough work"" ",459
machedon,5,,MATH240,"Excellent professor. Lectures are good. He does a lot of examples. And exams are very easy. If you attend all his lectures and do all the hw, there's no reason for you to not get an A.",459

Professor Machedon was a very efficient lecturer, so as long as you paid attention in class there was little to no reason not to do well.  The final was apparently written by the other professor but I didn't find it that difficult at all.  Just review the homeworks and you'll be fine.",459
machedon,5,A+,MATH246,"I found Machedon to be an excellent teacher as well as a great guy. His lectures were clear and very focused. He taught very straight forward, only covering subjects we needed to know and talked about theory only a few times. He was approachable and responded well to students concerns. His hws were helpful and exams were basically hw problems.
Try to take a class with him.",459
machedon,5,B-,MATH246,"Sooooooo...

His exams are easy, nevertheless, final exam will bring you back to earth. So just be prepared. 

Other than that he is a very good math professor. I Recommend!",459
machedon,3,A,MATH246,"His tests are a joke. The only thing is if you make one mistake it could cost you. Final was unfortunately not written by him, so that was a bit rough. However, if you have the option, definitely take Machedon. ",459
machedon,4,A,MATH246,"Diffeq is a joke with him, take it with him. ",459
machedon,4,,MATH461,"Personally, I love Matei. He is very approachable and helpful, but the reason I gave him a 4/5 and not 5/5 is because to be truthful he is not particularly user-friendly at times. This is because he has handwriting that American students aren't used to, i.e. cursive, and he doesn't write all that largely. He does indeed have a Russian accent, but it's not difficult to understand after the first class or so...but then again, I know many non-native speakers and may just be used to it.",459
machedon,5,A,MATH461,"I've taken Math461 and currently 246 with Machedon. No joke, as others have said, he is pretty much the nicest guy in the whole CMPS college. He really goes out of his way to explain things outside of class if you want extra help.

His exams are fair, homework is generally minimal(in collection, at least), but covers what you really need to know. You will definitely want to do something extra, or review that homework, if you expect to understand the material, though.

He does have an accent, but it's not hard to understand, and he really does lecture excellently. I'm really hoping to have more classes with him in the future.",459
machedon,4,A,MATH461,"Aliesh pretty much nailed it.  The guy is a brilliant professor and an overall nice guy.  The 1 homework per week is a bit annoying, only because I hate going to discussions.

The exams will be easy if you understand the practice exams and attend the review sessions.  In every exam, 70% of the points will be for basic problems that are absolutely pre-requisite.  The next 20% is a bit more challenging but not too hard.  10% will be hard as ajkhdajlkshd.  He uses this to weed out people who actually understand the material and those two regurgitate formulas well (such as myself).  The final was incredibly hard for those who didn't do the practice exams.  Those who did the practice exams, found it a cakewalk.",459
machedon,4,A,MATH461,"His class was a bit too easy in hindsight, but seeing as this was my last semester here and I was juggling a job, interviews, research and coursework, it's probably a good thing.

Machedon knows his audience; if you take him for a general level math or engineering course (200 level and 461 etc) he is NOT really going to challenge you very much. If you take him for a pure math course, however, he will expect a lot more out of you.

He assigns homework every week which I essentially copy pasted from the solutions manual (many times without looking twice at it) and there was one laughably easy MATLAB assignment.

Aside from being incredibly intelligent, Matei is a really nice guy and it will come across clear as day the moment you are in class with him. He is devoted to the subject and if you put in an effort, it will be rewarded.

Not a bad class, but I would have liked a bit more of a challenge.",459
machedon,1,,MATH246,"I can't believe how many good reviews there are of this professor! He just down right does not know how to teach.  You MUST go to lecture to even try to have a shot at a good grade and it is impossible to get an A.  Whoever the other professors are take them, cause they have to be better then Machedon!",459
machedon,3,,MATH461,"Sometimes lectures are difficult to follow but the fact that he is probably the nicest professor you will ever meet makes up for it. If you ever need extra time on homework or something just talk to him he'll probably allow you to do so. 

Sometimes he requires you to solve matrix equations using tricks that he teaches in class, so go. 

FYI his final was also somewhat difficult.",459
machedon,3,B,MATH246,"Not the best teacher but the material is not that hard. If you read the book you should have no problem grasping the concepts with the help of your TA's, dont expect much help from the professor. Grading is fair, if you get higher than 50%, you get a C. Then the passing grades are divided up ",459
machedon,3,,MATH461,"The lectures are at times tough to understand, but overall a decent lecturer.  There was very little MATLAB for this course and his exams were usually pretty fair.",459
machedon,5,,MATH461,"Professor Machedon definitely knows what he is talking about and while he does have an eastern European accent, his diction and grammar is better than almost any native English speaker that I know. I can understand every word, it is just not as easy on the ears as Sean Connery. 

In this class, the homework assignments are graded by the TA's and we have two mid-term exams and a final. The material comes across as abstract and without applications, but I realized that he is giving us is the theory and we will apply it in later engineering classes.

The material is also very different from previous math courses because a lot of it cannot be visualized, which made it difficult for me at first. But with study and practice it is not impossible to do well on the exams. I am glad that I took this class.

Also, the author of the book has video lectures on iTunes U and on the MIT website, where there is also other practice material. This is extremely useful and I would definitely recommend using this resource!!

I decided not to take MATH240 because it met almost everyday, whereas 461 only has lecture twice a week.",459
machedon,4,A,MATH461,"I wasn't a fan of his teaching style but his exams were generally easy. No quizzes and his grade breakdown was fairly simple. The book he uses is horrible. If you could take the other professor Lay, I would. His exams were really straight up but his final was difficult...so conceptual.",459
machedon,4,A,MATH246,"Even though he has a thick accent and horrible handwriting, go to class and just see what you're supposed to know. The written homework is not graded, but you should do it because it's the best way to prepare for weekly quizzes. The TAs do really good jobs at explaining stuff from lecture but it's not enough. Exams are fair but MATLAB hw was a bit hard. ",459
machedon,2,,MATH246,"Very very confusing when he teaches, but you should go to the classes and try to just get the general flow of what is going on because you have to make it click during discussion because there is a quiz almost every week. he often goes ahead in the book right before tests when it would be better if he just reviewed. he is bearable but if you don't understand make sure you go to your ta

machedon,3,A+,MATH405,"He's perhaps the nicest professor I've taken a class with in the math department. 

One complaint I have about the class in general is that it was too easy. Before the exam he would post ""practice problems"" and then when we got the exams we would discover that the exams basically had the exact same problems word for word. Essentially by the end of the course we have some students left who do not understand the basics very well as to ask questions which are either straight up incoherent or seemingly ""are you seriously asking that at this point in the course?""

The textbook for the class kind of sucks.

He was very willing to entertain some of my brief after-class discussions of some alternative and wacky ways to prove certain things.",459
machedon,3,B,MATH241,"Professor Machedon is a nice person that cares a lot about his students. However, he can be a little hard to follow while explaining the more complicated Calc III concepts. MATH241 with him wasn't bad, but having a condescending and ineffective TA (Maia) made it a lot harder.",459

machedon,5,,MATH405,"Super nice guy, maybe even too nice. He made the class very easy, and gave us exam questions beforehand for practice. We spent a lot of time on basic linear algebra topics, but overall still covered a fair amount of new and challenging material.",459
machedon,1,,MATH241,"Professor Machedon has an incredibly thick accent and his handwriting resembles the writing of a 2nd grader. His Calc 3 exams consisted of 5 questions each worth 20 points(4 realistic ones and 1 problem which he considered ""fun""). The ""fun"" one was incredibly difficult and I would just chuck down as many formulas that I could remember to hope and pray that I'd earn a few points. Luckily, my TA was great so I found discussion, office hours with TA, and constant practice problems to scrape out a 75%. I got 95 percents in calc 1 and calc 2(that was in high school and I know college courses are harder) however, there was no reason this class should've been so hard for me. Try your best to avoid him(I've heard great things about Wisely Wong and Terrance Long).",459

Even so, there were some things that could be improved about the course. I think he lectured a little too slowly. The exams were also really easy, which concerned me, both the people who scored abysmally on them and the people who did well on the exams and did not understand anything that went on in the class.
The textbook he uses for 405 (Curtis) I feel is pretty crummy as well.",459
machedon,5,A+,MATH411,"Knowledgeable professor. He almost never makes mistakes. Took the class during a pandemic, exams are slightly easier than usual. Exams are similar to practice problems.

However, he does expect you to read the textbook on your own, otherwise, his classes are too fast to follow.",459
fitzpatrick_patrick,3,,MATH463,"I am sad to say Fitzpatrick has probably fallen out of his prime. He is definitely not the same man as in these reviews.

I'd say he is generally very unorganized in class. The way he writes on the black board is just not organized. Most math professors are organized and provide separate discussions of definition, lemmas, and then theorems. He will just write things scattered across the board. 

Also, he is unable to do any slightly complex proof without making errors. He probably makes at least 1 error for every proof he does which is extremely confusing because you don't know if you can trust what he writes. Finally, I'd say his handwriting is very hard to read at times. He will omit letters in words and words just become scribbles.

He's definitely a kind person, I respect him a lot. He's the guy who wrote the MATH410 textbook, which is just excellent. But I felt this section deserved an update. One thing I noticed is that he seems very pale in class. I think his health may be affecting his teaching.",460

Sit up front in class, if you can.",460

He could not have taught the material in a more easy to understand way. So many good examples that were right on the test, always easy to contact via email, and just a sweethearted, nice guy. My TA was bad, but I feel like half the time that is just luck of the draw anyways. Sit in the first couple of rows, I promise it will make the extra difference!",460

The reviews seemed too good to be true, but any praise Professor Fitzpatrick gets is not enough! He is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I have received As on all of my exams!

He makes a pretty good amount of mistakes, but never in his practice, only because he will forget what he wrote on another side of the board. The students always catch these minor mistakes though, and he thanks them and continues. He knows all of his math in and out, is incredibly sweet, and his lectures are easy to follow and very thorough. 

His TAs are also really wonderful. I would recommend this class to ANYONE, but especially to people who need to take calculus and are worried about not doing well. Be prepared to put in some time for Webassigns, but other than that the class was an absolute joy to take. ",460
fitzpatrick_patrick,5,A,MATH220,"I loved Professor Fitzpatrick! 2 years later, he is still the best professor I've had at UMD.  It was the first Math class I took where I actually enjoyed going to class! He explained concepts so thoroughly and gave you the real world applications so that what he was telling you made sense.  Previously, I thought Calc would be hard - but with him, it was easy and enjoyable! I miss him!",460

BIG TIP: If you want to do well in this class, sit on the first 3 rows. I say this because his hand writing is sometimes hard to understand and he gives more attention to the front of the class like all professors.

I had never taken calculus before in my life and had a general hatred toward math, but after this class I love math and especially calculus.  I would consider changing my major to math if I could take all classes with Fitzpatrick, or fitzy is what I like to call him.  

In addition to his great teaching skills he has a great sense of humor.  He cracks jokes and does not even know it and has so many quotable moments you should probably write them down.

My friend and I wanted to take a picture with him at the end of the course because we loved him that much and he said ""Of course, as long as I get a copy."" So he has a great attitude about interacting with students.

As far as tests, quizzes and homework go.  Quizzes are super easy only got lower than 100 on one, the TAs literally go over the quiz and then give you a  quiz in class.  Tests are 5 quizzes long and little harder but use lots of example from class.  The webassign is actually the hardest part of the class and often takes 45 minutes to an hour but prepares you well for the tests.

Overall if you have a chance take a class with fitzy, best decision ever!

The course went more slowly than other graduate courses, but we seem to have covered all the intended material.  He seems to have something against abstracting too much, which can make some of the proofs more tedious than necessary.  But on the whole his style is very good.

fitzpatrick_patrick,5,B,MATH220,He is awesome. Very professional and made Calculus clear. Very detailed lectures and did a great job of explaining the material.

His tests are very fair. The only reason i didnt give him five stars is because he is not very apathetic. Like i said it was my first time taking calc so i didnt always do amazing on tests and when i went to discuss some issues i had, he didnt care at all. The other thing is  that his webassigns have no order. They are very sporadic and sometimes 2 at a time. I would definitely recommend his class especially if you are to calc. I you have taken calc before, this class is probably a no brainer. ",460
fitzpatrick_patrick,5,A,MATH220,"AMAZING calc teacher!! i took AP calc in high school so i guess that could have contributed, but even without it im sure i would have done well in this class. he teaches things step by step, goes through everything with tons of examples, and my TA was excellent as well which definitely helped. his tests are straightforward and pretty easy and he goes over all the types of questions that will be on the test beforehand. i honestly stopped going to lecture after the first few weeks except for the reviews before exams, and im getting an A because his exams/quizzes/webassigns arent too difficult at all.",460

Professor Fitzpatrick teaches in a way that is simple and makes sense. Also, each lecture before the exams he tells you exactly what kind of problems will be on the exam. I suggest going to lectures. I actually felt like I was learning something.

Make sure you do the webassigns. At the end of the semester the average is the equivalent to a test grade. Also go to discussion because the average of the quizzes are also worth a test grade. ",460
fitzpatrick_patrick,5,B,MATH220,"This guy is simply awesome!  Once you can get past his German accent and sometimes messy handwriting (like when he writes a ""d"" thing for partial derivatives) you will be so glad you took him. HE is very patient and he selected some great TA's (Get Doug Galagate if you can)  The Bad: He doesn't drop any tests.  The GOOD: His tests are 5 questions long and can be done WELL within the hour limit. He drops a random amount of HW's and quizzes (I guess it is cycle dependent).   He spends all the time going through equations on the board that you WILL SEE on your web assign and more importantly, YOUR TESTS! I CANNOT stress this enough.  I just finished my final and there was not one ""trick"" problem there!  It was all straightforward, the same thing and situations we studied throughout the class were the ones we were tested on. Isn't that kinda refreshing?

You have to go to your discussions though.  You get a quiz in each one and they count for a hundred points overall in fact... 

Test X 3 (100pts each) = 300
Quizzes  (10pts each)  = 100
Webassign              = 100
Final Exam             = 200

So it is all out of 700pts
Anyway, this guy is fair, is super helpful (he responds QUICKLY to email and will adjust your grade within the hour) and really likes what he does.  I don't think there is a curve to this class because there is no need for one.  Trust me, THIS IS A GOOD THING. PM me if you want to know the reason why teachers HAVE to curve..",460

I would recommend reading the material a day or two in advance that way you know what to expect. Also if you email him ahead of time he with questions he'll give a bit of extra time towards it in class. If not for technical limitations I would take another course taught by professor Fitzpatrick.",460
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR220,"This course was not too difficult in general, but will require a little bit of time each week spent on it.  This IS a science course - you're not going to be getting an A+ from just spending 20 minutes per week on it.  If you come to class (mandatory anyway), actually try, and be as interested as you can, you're going to feel like you got a lot out of it.

Dr. Hayes-Gehrke is very nice and a good speaker.  She's knowledgeable and keeps everyone involved during class.

The rest of this review is what to expect from ASTR220 with her teaching:

There's pre-lecture videos (anywhere from 20-45 minutes generally) followed by a quick multiple choice quiz.  TAKE NOTES WHILE WATCHING THE VIDEOS!!  You will be hating life later if you don't because you'll have no notes to study from for the exams.  I had groupmates that took zero notes and were complaining about having to watch the videos again to study for the exam.  These are your homework (alongside projects).  No textbook.

The pre-lecture videos prevent you from being lectured during class.  Instead, you're going to be doing rapid fire multiple choice questions, class discussions on the topics, and a calculation here and there with your groups.  She does this to prevent the typical ""lecture until you're bored"" style of class, and it works in my opinion.

Speaking of groupmates...you will have them for the entire semester.  You're going to be assigned them in the beginning of the semester - some you will be ok with, some you will dislike.  Learn to get along and distribute work instead of complaining, and your life will be a lot easier.  Use Google Docs to get your work done, add comments to papers, etc. to make your life so much easier.  Set deadlines, and start early!  If you follow those guidelines, you'll never receive less than an A on the projects.  And if anyone isn't pulling their weight, you get to grade your teammates based on work effort after the project is submitted.

You'll have multiple projects:  
1)  a research paper about a specific asteroid
2)  a poster (large powerpoint slide) project on a random astronomy topic/event, which you'll have printed and present to multiple people/groups
3)  a paper where you design a spacecraft to accomplish a specific goal/mission
4)  a debate (group vs group) about a random topic that you'll do in front of the class
These projects span across weeks, giving you tons of time to take your time on them and not make you feel overwhelmed.  I do feel that projects were graded a little harshly though.  They weren't unfair, but it just seemed that we lost a few points here or there for minor things, which was making it impossible to get the A instead of A- or B+.  

The grading also seemed to get MUCH harsher as the semester went on.  I felt that she was being overly picky on many aspects of grading projects and exams towards the end of the semester, especially given how busy you are juggling all of your classes.

Two midterms, which are average difficulty (35 multiple choice questions that are exactly like the in-class multiple choice questions she posts on the slides) and 6 or so short answer questions (sometimes involving a quick calculation or explanation).  Equations are provided, you'll just be expected to understand concepts like ""If this asteroid has properties A, B, and C, and I do ""this"" to it, what will happen?""  You get re-tests though:  You take the exam, and then you get another week or so to take the exact exam at home with all of your resources, classmates, etc. and bring it back in.  Your score will be the average of the two scores, and any additional points that you got from your average compared to your original score will be added as bonus points to your final exam score (since there's no re-test for the final).  i.e. if you got a 90, then re-test you got a 100, your average score is 95.  So 5 points are added to your final exam score.  Final exam was all essay/short answer questions.  Felt easy after finishing, but the grade was A LOT lower than I expected, again due to extremely nit-picky grading.

Discussion section is fine.  We had to get an assignment done each time (pretty easy) and just go over with our groupmates what we're doing/any progress on projects and such.  It's what you would expect.

Excluding studying for exams, you'll likely spend about 2-4 hours per week on this class (1-2 hours on pre-lecture stuff and another 1-2 hours on projects, depending on how hard you're working).  Overall, most people learned a ton from this course and want to take ASTR315 with her next semester (and are considering Astronomy minors).  ",464
hayes-gehrke,4,B,ASTR310,"If you focus on lectures alone, Hayes-Gehrke is a fantastic professor. She's clear,  patient with students, and open to student concerns and questions.

With that said, the workload for the number of credits that the course is worth is absolutely atrocious. In terms of what I'd consider to be assignments done out of class, there were ""Pre-Lecture Quizzes"" for nearly every lecture, ""Homework"" assignments for which there were 5, and ""Projects"" for which there were 3. 

The ""Pre-Lecture Quizzes"" are exactly as they sound like and take about 30 minutes each to complete. ""HW"" assignments could very easily be called projects in any other classes as they were fairly difficult and took a significant amount of time (upwards of 4 hours each). The 3 ""Projects"" we were assigned were even worse in terms of difficulty and time required for completion, and the last of the projects could well be considered 2 projects with a single due date. Any one of these 4 assignments would constitute a ""Final Project"" in another class.

Another caveat of the class is group work. You have to make resumes to post online to your classmates, against your classmates so that you can hurry and make fairly permanent groups in 10 minute scramble. This group is probably going to be with you for the rest of the semester working on each project. This can be both a good and a bad thing, as it's encouraged that you work with classmates on the HW assignments. Having a group you're comfortable with can make the HW process easier, but you're also stuck with them for 4 months. 

I've definitely learned a significant amount in this course, but not nearly as much as the work requirement should indicate. I would take the course again, but only if I were warned ahead of time of how much of a time Hayes-Gehrke demands.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A+,ASTR100,"I've taken three courses with this professor. When I was a freshman in ASTR100, I hated her. I felt like she babied her students and was condescending.

After taking two more classes with her (ASTR220 and ASTR300), she became my favorite teacher. She's written me multiple recommendations, and has been very helpful to me. She was always willing to listen to questions about grading, and after getting over myself I realized that her methods, while slightly babying, are amazingly helpful for learning the material.

You'll never find a professor more committed to helping every single student do well. If you are willing to actually do the homework (rarely more than half an hour) and do some group projects, you'll come out of it with a lot more knowledge and a professor who will write you great recommendations.

I fully recommend all three of the courses I have taken with her.",464
hayes-gehrke,1,,ASTR100,"Let me start by saying that I am NOT one to write reviews but after taking this course im sorry to say that professor gherke made me feel the need to warn people about her class.im not kidding when I say that this professor does not lecture. She forces you to watch pre-lecture videos of her talking before coming to class (most upwards of 25-30 minutes) which you then take a quiz on. This is horrible for learning as much as she thinks otherwise. I know she doesn’t believe in “traditional teaching styles” but her version of teaching is terrible (because she DOESN’T teach). Imagine teaching yourself and then coming to class and being quizzed everyday --- this is astr100 in a nutshell. Mind you, the grading in this course is insanely harsh.  I am a physics major taking this course for a minor and I was completely floored by the grades I was receiving in this class. She asks incredibly specific questions that ask you to apply what you know (often times trying to trick you) and will not hesitate to give you a 0/5 for a less than perfect answer. Her questions are sometimes so watered down and baby-ish that you will actually get them wrong just by second-guessing yourself. I loved astronomy before this but this professor has been incredibly frustrating. No matter how hard you study, she will never actually test you on anything but repetitive equations and hypothetical scenarios which you’ve never talked about. This class needs to SERIOUSLY be changed. Please save yourself the headache and do not take any course with this professor. Your gpa will thank you i absolutely promise.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A+,ASTR100,"After a few semesters, I've realized that professor Hayes-Gehrke is the best professor I think I've had here at UMD. She really, really wants you to learn the material, and teaches it to you how she thinks is best. If you do all the work she assigns (which really isn't that time consuming), I guarantee you will get an A in this class. She teaches you the information that you need to know before lecture in a pre-lecture video and then teaches you the same material with examples in lecture. This really drills the information into your brain. It was because of her teaching style that I got an A+ in the class and over 100 on the final exam, and frankly, I wish more teachers would teach like Hayes-Gehrke does.",464
hayes-gehrke,4,A,ASTR220,"Professor Hayes-Ghehrke is a pretty solid professor.  She taught the class very clearly, and almost always had an interesting picture or story related to the topic at the beginning of every class.
She does have her students do a little ""topic briefing"" and attendance slip that they have to pick up at the beginning of class and turn in on the way out, which means you have to attend most of her lectures unless you find a way to slip your attendance paper into the box at the beginning and leave.  Her classes are very interesting though, so I recommend just going to them.

The biggest downfall to this class is probably the group work.  There is a lot of it.  You usually end up doing a little group worksheet in most discussions, and there is a large ""poster project"" at the end of the semester that you must do in a group of around four.  As someone who despises group work, this aspect of the class sucked, but overall, it's a very fascinating class that you learn a lot of interesting things in, and Hayes-Gehrke herself is a very clear and easy to listen to professor.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR220,"I think Hayes-Gehrke is a really cool professor. Like others have said, she talks to you like your a kid and babys you through every single activity, but that only slightly takes away from her overall success as a lecturer. She really knows her stuff. 

The work, however is a different story. Before every single lecture, she posts mandatory ""prelecture"" videos that are often more than 30mins long. This can be super annoying. However, I find that I can skip through the videos in 5-10mins and still get a 100 on the quizzes. 

She is really a stickler on grading group projects. She takes points off in random places and I often found myself getting Bs when i thought i deserved at least an A-.

The one redeeming quality to the coursework is the exams. They are a complete joke. The way she works it is that you go to the exam and take it, and when youre done you pick up a second copy of the exam which you take home and complete with youre notes. You hand in the second copy and she averages the two grades together! You really have to be an idiot to get less than a B on the exams because what ever grade you get is averaged with a 100 (which I got on both midterm ReTests). 

Overall, the class can be kind of annoying sometimes, but I think the material is interesting and it really doesnt take that much effort to get a good grade. I would recommend taking it. ",464
hayes-gehrke,2,B,ASTR100,"Makes what should be a very easy class, very difficult. The workload was fairly large for a 100-level class. Also, a lot of the work that you submit for this class will be graded very harshly. Take another teacher.",464
hayes-gehrke,4,A,ASTR220,"I'm not really positive how I feel about Hayes-Gehrke and this class. I went back and forth between really liking her as a professor and really disliking her as a professor. I think by the end of the class, I settled into liking her quite a bit.

The class had a ton of group work, which became insanely frustrating at times. She did make a pretty solid effort to match the teams well, and my team was decent. Still, the class definitely could have done without a project or two, since I often felt like I was doing more work in this class than in some of my 400-level computer science courses. The exams were very easy, but they were not worth very much.

She kind of taught like she was speaking to a bunch of five year-olds. At the beginning of the course I thought it was a huge relief, since I'm sick of being held to a stupidly high standard in so many of my courses. After a while it became kind of annoying, and then frustrating since there was a stark contrast between how she spoke and what she expected of us in some projects, like the research poster. By the end of the course I began to appreciate it again. I don't think she does it to be demeaning, I think she is just a very kind and caring person to the point of sometimes sounding like a kindergarten teacher.

In the end I did well and learned a ton. I was surprised at how much I could learn while feeling like I was in a kindergarten classroom. I went from completely space-ignorant to being able to hold a serious conversation about pretty much anything related to our space program, especially if it concerned a threat of impact. I also feel like this class was among one of the most practical I took at the university, even though I only really took it because it had a badass name and I needed a core science. I feel like I'm highly informed if I ever have the chance to vote about space issues or make a case to anybody else. Overall, a valuable course, just gets super annoying at times.",464
hayes-gehrke,4,A,ASTR100,"This class was lot of fun. She had completely new style of teaching. So many activities in the classroom (no problem if you are shy); even planetarium like displays. But there is lot of work to do. You have to watch a pre lecture video before every lecture and do a quiz on that. Then you also have to write a post lecture summary every time. They seemed hard in the beginning but then you get use to it. One can get a in this class, if you devote that time here. Also, I would like to mention I learned so many new things from this course. Its completely wonderful and the only class in the week which I look forward to. TAs are one the best (extremely helpful) and professor is very sweet. There are 3 midterms and a final. There is a ""retest"" paper in all three midterms where you boost your score by doing the same exam you did the classroom now at home. She usually gives 3-4 days for that, and encourages discussing with fellow students. All exams are half multiple choice and half essay types. Scoring policies are extremely fair. Recommended!",464
hayes-gehrke,4,A-,ASTR220,"Professor Hayes-Gehrke is an interesting professor and definitely one-of-a-kind.

Basically, here are the main points about her that really (in my opinion) define her teaching style:

1) She is VERY patient with students' questions which leads me to believe that she has done a lot of research about teaching styles. Honestly, this can get pretty annoying if you have a head on your shoulders as there were a couple of people in my class who would literally ask her a question that she had just explained thoroughly and she would jump right in without a thought (and waste time).

2) As implicitly stated above, she likes to baby her students. She takes attendance, has mandatory rough draft editing for papers and never, ever refrains from answering a terrible question.

3) This might sound harsh, but she's a fairly poor quiz/exam writer. She has a tendency to say something in class and then put an oddly worded question on an online quiz that correlates to what she said but has a slightly different answer than what you'd expect based on her wording. Her exam questions are also pretty tricky.

4) This is the most important point of all: She somehow manages to make the class very interesting from start to finish. I think it's her delivery style but I had little trouble in following her throughout the entire lecture (unless I was exhausted). She definitely made this course a fun experience for me.

Based on all of the above I recommend taking ASTR220 with Dr. Hayes-Gehrke. She's got her quirks but the class is pretty interesting and the exams and quizzes are easy enough where getting an A in the class isn't too much trouble. Oh, one more thing, if you like group projects than take this class -- We had to do ~5 (and they were graded fairly easily).",464
hayes-gehrke,4,B-,ASTR100,"She's definitely excited about the material, I'll giver her that. The way this class is currently structured is also really nice. I took this class once before, and it has really been streamlined since then. The textbook has been scrapped, and has been replaced by online ""pre-lecture summaries"" and ""pre-lecture quizzes"". All you gotta do is watch the pre-lecture summary and then take the 8-point or so multiple choice quiz. Sounds easy enough, but it can get aggravating when the pre-lectures are easily as long as the in-class lectures themselves. Plus you gotta do the darn things three times a week. On top of that, each in-class lecture is followed by an online ""post-lecture summary"" that is related to the lecture material, but oftentimes requires you to think outside the box more.

The exams are also easy (I can't say much about the final, I haven't taken that yet). The attendance policy is forgiving and the lectures are by no means boring. You can tell Ms. Hayes - Gerhke is really trying to find the ""perfect formula"" for getting students to remember information. 

One thing I wish she would stop doing is treating the class like little kids. She has a habit of stating something that is blatantly wrong, then asking ""do you agree? Or... is that not the case?"" or something to that effect. Then she waits for people to say WHY her statement is incorrect, and all the while people just sit there going ""durr... do we really have to spell it out for you? Again?"". It might just be another weapon in her arsenal of learning techniques (specifically, the weapon of mindless repetition), and if it is, I don't like it. The flash cards she uses are also kind of lame. The colors of the cards are generic and not at all what I'd expect from a college-level astronomy class.

",464
hayes-gehrke,3,B,ASTR100,"She is a great person, nice, and never judges students or makes them feel bad. But she does baby the students around, I felt like I was in middle school. I thought this class would be a breeze because of her teaching style but I was wrong. She screwed us all over with the midterms. Yes, there is a curve, and I thought I would be fine, but I ended up getting a B and so did everyone else. She is nice but she is an unfair grader and has a TA that is the most clueless and dumb TAI have ever seen in my life. ",464
hayes-gehrke,2,B,ASTR100,"She was an okay teacher. She dumbed it down which is good if you are not a science person. On the exams, particularly the exam 3, she totally screwed us over. She made all the essays tricky and worded them badly. Basically in discussion the entire class was talking about how terrible she worded the questions to purposefully mess us up. She's a nice person and lectures aren't too bad. 

IF you wanna take this class..just remember to STUDY YOUR BUTT off for midterm 3. For a core class it could be a lot worse. Overall, I personally I am not extremely fond of her but for science she's not too bad. Just expect a lot of work. ",464
hayes-gehrke,4,B,ASTR220,"She's an excellent teacher. She is very friendly and open to questions. She never patronizes a student for answering a ""stupid"" question as many professors here at Maryland do (based off personal experience). 

This class is NOT easy though. It is not an easy A at all and does require a lot of work. There is a post-lecture quiz after every lecture, 2 tests, 1 final, 1 research paper, 1 project, 1 team debate, discussion and attendance. I suggest having taken Astr100 because you do jump right into Astronomy. I recommend the teacher, not the class if you're looking to satisfy an easy CORE class.",464
hayes-gehrke,3,A,ASTR100,"Interesting class, easy A, lots of work. You might be turned off by her ridiculous demanding of extremely large amount of time for a simple 100 level class, but you get to learn a LOT. You'll be tempted to skip lectures, but she takes attendance. For both lectures and discussion. 

My TA on the other hand was useless, condescending, and self-absorbed. She would make herself sound smart by saying terms that we don't even need to know for the exams. Things that she's learned in her ""upper"" level Astr class. I mean, really though? I didn't enjoy the discussion portion mainly because of her.

Overall, this class made me decide to minor in Astronomy. If you think it's interesting, or just need a PS core, then I would definitely recommend you taking it with Dr. H",464
hayes-gehrke,3,A,ASTR100,"I am not a science person at all, but the professor made the course material pretty interesting with examples and demonstrations of concepts in class. Some of the material can be difficult, but if you do all the work and study at least a little, you'll do fine. 
Exams can be graded pretty unfairly on the short answer sections, because sometimes it seems like A LOT more points are taken off than should be for whatever little mistake was made. BUT after every midterm, you can choose to do an easy ""mid-term analysis"", explaining why you got each wrong answer wrong (which you can discuss with your TA) and that will give you an automatic 10% added back onto your midterm.
She takes attendance every class with a slip you have to personally hand to a TA, and attendance is a good portion of your grade. There is also a pretty time consuming ""pre-lecture video"" (usually about 30 min) accompanied by a ""pre-lecture quiz"" before EVERY lecture, and a ""post-lecture summary"" after EVERY lecture. If you do the quizzes and go to lecture, you never have to read. It's not hard work, but this class does take A LOT of time. ",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A+,ASTR220,"She is a fantastic professor. I am always amazing how enthusiastically she will answer people's stupid questions or questions that she had answered like 2 seconds before.  She is very nice and engaging. 

The class is extremely easy but also really awesome. I mean it's a class on saving the Earth from an asteroid collision, what could be more interesting.  There is a online quiz after every lecture that you can do anytime and questions are right from the lecture which are on elms and you can use. I have not gotten lower than a 100 on one and they take maybe 5 minutes. No homework or in class quizzes. 

There are three projects, a 4 page research paper and 8 minute presentation on an interesting topic. A mission to build a spacecraft to study an asteroid with a budget. And finally an in class debate. All these projects are done with a group that was picked for you at the beginning of the year. Have not really met with my group once except to watch Deep Impact, and still get good grades. 

There are three exams, two midterms and a final. All very easy, with the ability to get ten points extra on the exam if you do corrections.

Overall, one of the easiest and most satisfying classes I have taken at UMD. I would recommend it to everyone.",464
hayes-gehrke,2,B,ASTR100,"The professor is very engaging and interesting. She makes astronomy seem fun, and makes you want to learn. However, she is an extremely unfair grader. You can write a textbook answer on a test, and she will take off 90% of the credit because you skipped one word that did not even pertain to the question. It is still relatively easy to do well in this class, because you get a lot of points for coming to class and completing the homework, but do not expect to do well on any of the tests",464
hayes-gehrke,1,B,ASTR220,"Unprofessional and unfair grader. Even though answers are written correctly and explained in appropriate fashion, she cuts the points. You would think, you have given complete answer, but wait til you get grades back. I'm sure, she loves to cherry pick on your answers. I went to her office to explain grading, but she already made up her mind. (DON'T BOTHER ARGUING, YOU ARE NOT GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE). I have answer key of her homework, I wrote it from it, still cuts the points. UNPROFESSIONAL, BIAS, AND UNFAIR. She makes fun class, confusing and complicated. She does not deserve to teach.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR100,"I hate astronomy and do not find this class that difficult. Yeah you have to go to class and discussion but thats like 20% of your grade and can help you a lot. Also my TA was amazing so that helped. No matter how bad you do there is always a 10% increase. So if you get a 80% on a test or homework it becomes a 90%. The teacher is enthusiastic so that is nice, she actually loves the subject. And there is only 8 hw for the entire semester and one is dropped. I would recommend this for someones non lab.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR100,"This class is not that bad if you go to class and do the work.  Attendance is mandatory; everyday you have to write your name on a colored slip of paper that she makes.

Homeworks are time-consuming, but not that difficult.  You don't have to read the book.

The class may seem hard at first, but it gets easier.  Your TA can make or break the class, but discussions are very helpful because you always do this multiple choice worksheet which exam questions often come from.

The class is very organized.  She teaches until the end of class.  The professor is always willing to answer questions.  She posts the lectures online.  The slides are very informative, not broad like other professors' slides may be.

One of the best professors I have had.",464
hayes-gehrke,2,,ASTR100,"I did not like her. The material in class was as easy as you would expect from a 100 level course, but the complicated and downright childish way she does things makes it ridiculous. I haven't been told ""you cannot use a calculator and you must show all of your work in this specific format"" since High School. Get real, lady. Also, the tests are only worth 45% of the grade, the rest is a random mix of homeworks, quizzes, and lecture and discussion attendance. I did not like the fact that only 50% of the points on the tests were multiple choice. Those were easy. The rest were short answer Qs that were graded harshly. I got 3 out of 10 points taken off my answer to one question because I forgot to include the words ""low density."" 

Also, the 2 times I communicated with her, once via email and once in her office, she seemed very snippy and not that willing to help. I really would not recommend taking ASTR-100 with her if you are looking for something that is as easy as a 100 level class should be.",464
hayes-gehrke,3,A,ASTR100,"Really easy class with very generous curves on the exams and interesting material, but a ton of homework and mandatory attendence in lecture and discussion.  For me, the big downside was the textbook/CD.  It costs $120 and the bookstores won't buy it back once its been opened.  The book is only alright and the CD is required for access to online homework.  If you want either one cheap, e-mail me: alangwor@umd.edu",464
hayes-gehrke,3,,ASTR220,This class is hard for no reason. The homeworks are graded harshly and there are alot of them.  Only take if you love astronomy.,464

She takes attendence at lecutre, and their is a ton of crazy busy work (online quizzes) which aren't hard but annoying. There are also 9 homeworks, which are pretty tough and graded hard. I wouldn't reccomend this class to anyone unless you are just really in love with astronomy.",464
hayes-gehrke,4,B,ASTR100,"She is an amazing teacher. She is especially good if you are bad at science, because she explains the material in a really clear way and makes it easy to understand. The course material is extremely interesting. The homeworks count for a big part of your final grade, and a lot of what is on the tests comes from the homeworks. There are 3 midterms and 11 homeworks. Overall, a really good class, especially if science isn't your thing.",464
hayes-gehrke,4,A,ASTR100,Very nice professor. exams are straightforward and are based on lectures and homework. lectures are online but she makes lecture mandatory. homework is time consuming. the online text book is a complete waste of money.,464

She's good in trying to explain things and its very helpful to go her and her TA's office hours. The discussion and textbook is very unnecessary. Its important to study the homeworks and lecture notes",464
hayes-gehrke,1,,ASTR100,"This class was way too hard for a 100-level class.  I really don't think it was fair that we couldn't even use a hand help calculator on exams.  She was nice, but it was very very hard.",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR100,"Awesome teacher! She lectures extremely well, and going to class and copying down her notes is very helpful.

She gives quizzes once in a while, but theyre extremely easy (rewards for coming to class).",464
hayes-gehrke,5,A,ASTR310,"ASTR310 is a class that takes in a lot of effort in terms of workload and textbook use, but Dr. Hayes-Gehrke is a fantastic professor who works harder than most professors to make sure everyone understands the material and is getting the work done.",464
hayes-gehrke,1,A-,ASTR100,This class is awful.  I took this class thinking it would be interesting and fun but it's not.  It's a flipped format class and Gehrke doesn't teach at all practically.  You have to watch lectures outside of class and lectures are pretty much a waste of your time.  The quizzes and other assignments are not hard if you are watching the pre lectures but the exam questions are much more difficult because she doesn't stress what is actually important in for the test. Awful class. ,464
hayes-gehrke,4,A+,ASTR100,"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR ONLINE INSTRUCTION:

I enjoyed the asynchronous nature of the course but the way the professor decided to restructure the course was WAY overcomplicated. There were no grades, just ""badges"" that you get after completing assignments. It was nearly impossible to remember what amount of badges correspond to what grade. There's more about this but it's going to be irrelevant soon anyway. This is my only reason for 4/5 stars. 

As for the professor herself, she's an incredibly nice person who's clearly enthusiastic about space and teaching it to students. She's very generous when it comes to grading and seems to genuinely strive for student success. ",464
jakobson,5,A,MATH246,"Firstly I gotta say that before taking DFQ I knew nothing about this course, and Dr. Jakobson just screwed it up even more severer. I never absented but all I could do in his class this whole semester is merely sitting, napping and playing my cell phone. I totally got no idea about what he was talking about. Thanks for my lovely TA I didn't screw up whole things at the end before finals.
So 4 stars for TA, 1 star for Dr. Jakobson(for his hard work awww).
DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS UNLESS YOU GOT BALLS IN MATH",468
jakobson,3,B,MATH246,"If you're good at self-teaching, this professor is the one for you.
I'll just go ahead and say it outright; he's not a good teacher in any sense of the phrase. Most of the notes that were useful when the exams came around came from my discussion sections, although the TA wasn't superb either.
The problems and concepts aren't difficult or complicated at all; they're just incredibly numerous and Jakobson doesn't do a very good job in explaining them. 
If you're preparing yourself to take this class, understand that either you'll: 
a) be on the same page as him as few of the students were, or 
b) be pretty lost a lot of the time and will be engaging yourself heavily in the textbook. 
While he might be hard to understand, it certainly helps to read ahead and study the textbook prior to the lectures because you'll actually understand what's going on. 
However, I will say that his exams and quizzes are very fair. Simply teach yourself the rather basic concepts, do the suggested problems, and you'll probably be okay.
Of 6 MATLABs, he drops the lowest grade for a total of 100 points and out of 150 earnable quiz points, he only accepts 100 in the final grade and he never really explained how that part works. 3 midterms are 100 points each and the final is worth 200.",468
jakobson,3,B+,MATH246,"The review for Jakobson was misleading. He is portrayed as a really horrible professor but in retrospective, he was not bad mostly because his exams and quizzes were straightforward. Although some matlab homeworks were pain, they were doable since we were allowed to work in a group of 3. We only had about 5 matlab projects. Also, he gave out 5 extra credit points for each matlab projects if the  presentation of the assignment was pretty. However, his lecture notes are very messy and I had to mostly self teach myself or rely on my TAs. Speaking of TAs, I got cheated out of an A because my TA never revealed to us that we could get extra credit points for matlab assignments until around the time before 3rd assignment was due.  If you do the suggested book problems, you should  do well on his exams.  I would recommend taking him if you do not wanna be bothered by huge amounts of matlab assignments and terribly difficult exams. ",468
jakobson,5,A,MATH246,"Because of all the low reviews here, I didn't have very high expectations for Jakobson going in.  As it turned out, Jakobson was much better than his reviews give him credit for.  He usually teaches much better than the book does and always says what exactly is expected of you for each type of problem on a test.  The book is good for the easier topics (integrating factors, exact equations) but becomes pretty useless later on in the course.  At this point, you definitely want to go to lecture and he will make things pretty simple.  He doesn't really try to trick you on tests or quizzes.  If you can do the majority of the problems in the suggested homework, the tests are simple.  He never really gave any integrals that were too tricky to evaluate. He ended up dropping our lowest quiz grade, and our lowest test was only weighted as half of a test.  Gives pretty good partial credit, and is very organized. Homework problems are suggested and not graded.  Matlab can be very time-consuming and annoying because you have to work in a group of 3, so I would recommend joining a discussion section with a few friends who you know are reliable, because it is a real hassle if you get stuck with random people who don't know what they're doing. Overall, I would definitely recommend Dr. Jakobson.",468
jakobson,4,C,MATH246,"It's not very hard to do well with this professor if you stay on top of your homework. I barely did homework and I got a C in the class.  If you go to the lecture and discussion right before an exam, hints are dropped like bombs about the problems that will be on it.  Even without the hints you get, the problems are pretty straightforward.  The final was made up of easy problems, it was just long.  Also, this professor dropped half of the the score of the worst exam and he gave extra credit on the Matlab projects. And while he wasn't the best lecturer, he certainly wasn't the worst.",468
jakobson,3,,MATH246,He is not the teacher to teach the materials however he is not a harsh professor. He makes adjustments in the class to help students. His exams are not difficult if you do all the home work and he usually tells you before the exam what is on there. However he doesn't make the final. The final is different from what he does in class. The wording of the questions and the style of questions are different. ,468
jakobson,1,C,MATH246,"His lectures are 100% a waste of time.  He is very difficult to understand and he barely erases the chalkboard so it's difficult to read his notes.  The only time his lectures made sense were when I studied the topic before class, and even then I got lost about 20 minutes along.  

That being said, his exams and quizzes are generally a lot easier than some of the other instructors.  Compared to Balan (the other option this semester) the exams were easy.  

If you can afford the time, wait to take DiffEQ when there is a decent professor teaching it.  The subject is so boring that a terrible teacher makes me lose interest in studying for the class at all.",468
jakobson,1,,MATH246H,"Hands down the worst math professor on campus. He blatantly does not care one bit about the material he is teaching or about his students.
He avoids students when they're trying to reach him for help. He makes absolutely no effort to explain anything, his handwriting is terrible and narrated in useless comments that emphasize irrelevant or unimportant aspects while failing to build any sort of understanding. The homework he assigns often doesn't cover what's on the exam.

If you have him, switch out immediately. I've had him twice for MATH246 - failed the first time and will likely fail again. He was listed as ""Staff"" so I didn't know what I was signing up for the second time around -  I should have dropped the class the moment I saw him walk through the door.",468
jakobson,1,B,MATH410,"Jakobson was truly disappointing to learn from. He came to lecture and scribbled down some notes while mumbling in broken english. He did not want any input from the class, nor to talk to any of his students. He clearly had better things to be doing, and it seemed like this class was at the bottom of his priority list. His proof methods are sloppy, and I have a feeling that if he were the grader the grades would have been fine, but that was not the case. Some grad student the class never met did 100% of the grading, and was ultra meticulous. He is a fine guy, but I would avoid his class at all costs. I ended up with my first D ever, completely to my surprise. I am however, looking forward to redeeming myself with a better professor. Just don't take it with him, flat out.",468
jakobson,3,B,MATH410,"Jakobson was completely useless in lecture. It's hard to understand him and he never was helpful when it came to the homework. HOWEVER, he is pretty generous when it came to grades. He drops 4 homeworks, gives some extra credit, and will round up your final grade.

May not be the best teacher, but you are more likely to get a better grade with him than some of the other professors. Teach yourself and do the hw with a friend and you will be fine.",468
jakobson,1,A-,MATH461,"WORST PROFESSOR.  20 people went to class regularly (armory room is full on test days) because his lectures are that bad.  Can't understand him.  Can't read his awful handwriting.  Tests have many curve-balls and are completely different each time.  Very hard to study for.  Tests did not represent knowledge of subject.  I retook this class because I didn't get transfer credit.  Got A+ last time - barely, barely squeezed an A- this time even though the material was the exact same.  Stay far away from this professor.",468
jakobson,1,,MATH461,"The overall material itself was mildly interesting. I wish I could say the same however for Professor Jakobson's lectures. After the first 15 minutes on the first day, I realized that I was never going to learn a single thing from his class and that the semester was going to essentially be an independent study in Linear Algebra. His lectures are dry and boring, assuming one can read his handwriting on the chalkboard or understand his accent. And if you can get past both of them, that's also assuming that you can stay awake after listening to a couple of minutes of his monotone speech. Overall, going to lecture was a waste if you try to pay attention and learn from him. However, they were very productive as a good study environment if you took the textbook in class and just taught yourself the material from the book as he was lecturing on it. I can guarantee that most of the other people in that lecture would agree with me in how only a handful of us would show up to lecture each time. Even then, the number of students in lecture would exponentially decay as time went on, starting from the first couple of minutes of class, with students leaving as though they came to lecture with the hope that it would be somewhat effective in learning the material, forgetting just how bad Jakobson’s lectures are and then being hit with the same revelation each time that it really was pointless to show up to class. Again, I was probably one of the few that regularly came to class and that was due solely to the fact that I realized that if I was able to tune out the lecture, I was able to teach myself the material from the book and understand it on a much deeper level than I could ever hope to gain from listening to Jakobson’s lectures. I can confidently say that this class has by far been the one with the least effective professor I’ve ever had in my entire time I have been in school, going as far back as pre-k. ",468
jakobson,3,A,MATH246H,Tests and quizzes aren't very difficult as long as you know what you are doing. Lectures are extremely boring and the matlab assignments are pretty time consuming. The class overall is not too bad. You should have no trouble getting an A or a B.,468
jakobson,3,,MATH660,"Not a particularly good lecturer, but fair grader.",468
jakobson,1,C-,MATH246,"Jakobson may be the worst lecturer on campus. His speaking, writing, and teaching style make it nearly impossible to learn anything in his lectures, resulting in less than 10% of the class attending each lecture. My TA was the only reason I learned anything in the class, as his website and provided textbook are a mess to navigate and get information from. The homeworks and quizzes we had did little to build on what we did learn, even when we had an assignment or quiz every week. Avoid at all costs.",468
jakobson,2,P,MATH246,"Would not recommend it, took him online due to COVID and he wasn't lenient about turning in any quizzes late yet wouldn't include time to actually submit. Overall I would say his exams were hard yet would have followed his lectures if I could have understood them. His notes and lectures were too hard to understand for me so I resorted to Justins notes. If I hadn't chosen pass-fail I probably would have gotten a C+. The dropped quizzes and dropped matlab that he offers are helpful yet are the only form of curve he provides",468
jakobson,1,P,MATH246,"The worst professor I have had at umd. His lecture style is terrible and don't expect to be able to read his notes because they're illegible. Pretty sure UMD only holds onto him because of tenure. His exams for the most part are actually pretty straight forward but between the lectures being ass, the textbook being ass, and the TAs taking off points every chance they get, the course was an overall uphill battle and it was super hard for me to learn. It also didn't help that things were online this semester due to COVID. I love math and I know I would have loved Diffeq if it had been taught to me properly but because it wasn't I had the exact opposite experience. Highly recommend switching out if you have him unless your only other choice is Hamilton. ",468
jakobson,1,A,MATH246,"Good God where do I begin. By far the worst teacher I’ve had in my life. To get things out of the way, do not take him unless the only other possible option is Hamilton, no matter how much schedule rearrangement is needed. Draw the line only at dropping necessary classes if it means avoiding him. Lectures make absolutely no sense at all, does nothing to respond to student questions/concerns, my TA was no help, and I had to practically rely solely on GSS and self-teaching to pass (shoutout to Victoria). A 130-ish person class had only about 15-20 attending lecture within a few weeks. Assuming he keeps this semester’s grading policy, there is no curve either. He drops your lowest Matlab and 2 lowest quizzes. Lowest exam gets replaced by half of final. Got an A in spite of him, not because of him.",468
laskowski,5,,MATH712,"Extremely friendly professor, always smiling and enthusiastic about the subject matter.  Flexible office hours.  Reasonable homework load.  Both exams were take-home, and were fairly straightforward.  Homework and exam problems often involved results that would prove important in later lectures, which was nice. 

He has a fairly idiosyncratic lecturing style, but I enjoyed it.  Proofs are done in full rigor, but he often pauses to summarize what's going on in informal ""slang,"" which is for the most part very helpful though occasionally his choice of terms is a bit perplexing.  He gives a lot of context and motivation for the material, which is very nice.

The only gripe I have (and it's a minor one) is that his constructions for a few of the major results were quite different than those given in most reference materials.  I do find his approach rather more appealing than what appears to be the ""standard,"" but this was a bit problematic at times.",469
laskowski,4,B,MATH241,good prof.  I would have had an A if i went to more lec and stayed up with the book.  The material is not very interesting and sometimes confusing but his tests are fair and the quizzes and MATLAB's really help pull ur grade up in the class.  He is one of the better prof in the MATH department. ,469
laskowski,5,A,MATH241,Really a great professor.. def knows how to teach... really awesome lecture... has a diff way of teaching tho :),469
laskowski,2,,MATH241,"I did not appreciate the way that he just made up random terms, and used very strange definitions of theories. He did not just dumb down the calculus concepts; it seemed as though he dumbed down the english language as well. Lecture was especially painful to sit through, but the tests were not too bad. Five tests (plus final), five matlabs (one is a freebie) and quizzes are left up to the TA, so it was not a very difficult class.

He seems very nice, and always (somewhat overly) excited to teach. Unfortunately, I just did not like him as a teacher. Sure, it's a dull subject. But I would rather learn the material than spend a semester talking in fake terms.",469
laskowski,5,A+,MATH221,"A very clear and insightful teacher. Three tests and and exam, plus weekly quizzes in discussion. I would recommend him to anyone who needs to take a math course.",469
laskowski,4,,MATH241,"Very good professor.  Clear in his explanations, and he really seemed to enjoy teaching the material.  The subject matter is dry so there's only so much he can do, but he tried.  Fair tests and grading.",469
laskowski,4,A,MATH221,"Good lecturer (as far as math lecturers go), but he really does care that you understand the material, and will go out of his way to respond to your questions. 
I had to miss his final exam, and he was an absolute dear in accomodating me. ",469
laskowski,4,B,MATH241,"Knows his material, entertaining lectures, typical MATH241 exams. Best of the bunch, I'd say.",469
montague-smith,3,C,CHEM241,"I had to drop the course, what does this mean? nothing but, I just couldn't learn with him. 

   The other reviews say he is funny, yes. He has lots of Dad jokes. 

    Energetic, yes, he is certainly passionate and very smart in the subject.

   Good teacher? To each his own. he was not for me, I did try and  I had to drop after the second exam. He is straightforward on his exam, they are long but I thought they were difficult. Not unfair but difficult. He told the class if you do not have X amount of points by now on the exams, drop the class. So I did. I now have to take it over the summer. I do not resent Dr. MS or anything like that. Just be aware that his lectures are fast, there is a lot of material in REALLY BAD handwriting. Do not close your eyes for even a second. I wish I took a different professor but, he is not bad, he is not scary but he is intimidating. I felt like I could not go to office hours without being judged, so I did not go. Other Chem prof have open office hours which are extremely helpful. He is not personable which is a shame, he does not want to make friends with his students and that's fine but, it's not my style. Be prepared to work and practice, he is not going to hold your hand. He dies not help out by giving you practice problems or anything like that and of course no answer keys to his old exams. The old exams are truly the only way to study and without an answer key I find them very difficult even when studying with others. 

The bottom line is this, take this prof if you know you work hard because those who do not will not take him. If you are below average on exams, drop the class because people will only get smarter as the class goes on and odds are you are already behind. The exams are long but they are fair. they are complex reaction problems that warrants basically no partial credit. The NMR on the first exam was so easy but the second exam impossible, if I had gotten those right I would have stayed in the class. Just an honest opinion her, great guy, ok teacher but the fact of the matter is he does not care about his students, he does not care how you feel about him and he does not care if you fail or succeed. He would rater see you leave than fail and he tells you that. So listen to him. I thought I could get a C in his class and chalk it up as I did ok but, honestly I did not have a chance.",470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM241,"I had MS for CHEM231 and CHEM241, so this review is for both. Love him. I would take an orgo III with him if I could.

Pros:

- Straightforward exams
- Lecture style (easy to follow)
- Generally humorous
- Very predictable
- Clicker questions to boost your grade (for attendance, not correctness)
- Practice exams from the chem frat are very similar to his current exams
- HUGE curve

Cons:

- Terrible handwriting (you'll get over it)
- No matter who you take, orgo is based solely on your ability to rote memorize so try not to suck at it

MS's best feature is his predictability. I'll give you the full story on how your experience in his class is going to go: You sign up for the class. You get a mass email from him welcoming you to CHEM2X1 (which he reuses every year, and just changes a few numbers). First day of class, he attempts to butter you up so that you either think you've scored the golden professor by the end of it, or you hate him because you like more serious professors. Second day of class and onward, you'll have 1-3 clicker questions (you don't have to get it right, they're attendance points). You'll be astounded by how bad his handwriting is, but quickly get over it. The difference between whether you like MS or not lies in how much you like his lecture style.

MS keeps his energy up, whether it's 9 AM or 2 PM. He tells personal life stories to make you laugh (predictably, he reuses those too). It won't seem like it, but he's actually a very straightforward lecturer, especially in 241 - he literally just gives you the reactions and mechanisms you need to know, in addition to clear-cut reasons why they run the way they do. He had what I considered to be a fairly organized and simple system, which is why studying for exams wasn't too bad (by the time an exam rolls around and you start studying, you see the method to his madness). He also makes sure to emphasize nuances that appear on the test (like acetals don't react in base).

Your grade consists of 1 quiz (multiple choice test on either gen chem I material or CHEM231 material, depending on which class you're in), 3 exams, 1 final, and clickers.

The format of exams is generally always the same. For CHEM231, there's some funky stuff (chair conformation, Newman projection, etc.), some reactions, a mechanism or 2, and multiple choice. For CHEM241, he gets even more predictable: 3-4 pages of reactions, 1-2 mechanisms, 1-2 synthesis, 1-2 NMR. He sends out a list on what you'll be tested on, so there's no surprises. As long as you know every reaction he ever gave and all the mechanisms on the list, you should be fine. He even picks from a set stock of NMRs. There's no surprises/tricks on his exams.

The curve is massive as well, like 20-25% (although he'll maintain that it's around 15-20%, don't be fooled). Top 25% of the class gets an A/A-.

Also I went to his office hours a couple of times, he was quite nice to me so I don't know why other people had bad experiences but let's be real, it doesn't even matter. He always gets the best TAs (Liz or David) so you can ask them questions instead anyway.

This review is getting too long, but save yourself the trouble of taking Dixon or any other teacher and just take him, you'll live. He makes orgo super doable.",470
montague-smith,5,A+,CHEM241,"You have to take Orgo 2 with MS. He's funny, always tells interesting stories when he was in grad school, and has molecule of the day section that relates orgo to our everyday lives. 
His tests are very hard and the avg is usually in the high 50's but they're very straight forward. Its just all reactions. Everyone knows whats a going to be on his test. Its just a matter of knowing how to do it. 
Definitely take MS for orgo 2, i guarantee you won't regret it. Theres a reason his sections always fill up fastest",470
montague-smith,4,,CHEM241,"Here's the low-down on 241 with Montag. He's hilarious and extremely entertaining, even at 8AM in the morning.

He gives you the reactions straight up, and only what he gives you is on the exam. Plus, if you pay attention in class he often emphasizes what he will and will not put on exams (very helpful).

You do not need to use your book (looked at it only when I missed lecture). His TA Liz is the bomb dot com. She helps with labs if you ask for it, explains things very well, is merciful, and responds to all inquiries, e-mailed, in class, or in person.

Clickers are 100 points...

The final is a joke and a half (for an orgo exam).

Don't worry about the grading distribution...he said an 85 was an A- but I ended with an 82 and got an A. If you get a 60 I'm pretty sure that'll still be a B-. THE CURVE IS HUGE PEOPLE. You will be okay. I recommend him.

Only problem is his chicken scratch handwriting. I'd write things down in my notebook wrong all the time. Just check with friends and you'll be fine.",470
montague-smith,3,,CHEM241,"Teaching ability: I had him for organic 2 which, as everyone knows, is not an easy class to teach. I ended up getting a B. I felt he was easy to follow, and provided clear explanations as far as reaction mechanisms and such. However, he rarely provides a comprehensive view of how all of the reactions relate in the grand scheme. You could say he paints the trees rather than the woods. I think it's unlikely you will get a B or higher in this class if you don't attend GSS (a weekly meeting where a previous student provides practice problems and clarifications)

Testing: Tests are extremely long and difficult, so time management is key! Do not underestimate this. His tests strictly adhere the material covered in class. If the book has a section that he just glossed over, then it's not going to play a huge role in the exam.

Personality: In one word, BIPOLAR. I have emailed him questions before and he was very rude in reply. Seriously talks to you like you are a piece of crap. Really really awful. He also was my advisor for some time, and was extremely hot and cold. The majority of time, he is so personable in class, but is randomly very grumpy. I also find him to be a little arrogant. I started out loving him, but over time his true colors have emerged. 

A note about Organic Chemistry 2: This subject has some inherent properties that can't be blamed on the instructor. For example, the heavy reliance on memorizing, the almost impossible to master infinite number of details, etc etc. Please know what you're getting into before you take this class. It is not easy for some people. ",470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM241,"He is a very good professor and makes the material relatable to real life. He always started class with a molecule/substance that we use in everyday life that also relates to what we are leaning that day. He doesn't expect you to memorize the 240 or so reactions that you will know by the end of the semester.. rather he actually teaches you the chemistry behind everything. I am in higher level chem classes right now and i still look back at his old notes. 

Overall he is an amazing teacher... one of the best on campus. I try to convince all my friends to take his class because it is truly worth it. 

* his class also goes hand in hand with the laboratory. you learn the same things at the same time.. unlike alot of other orgo II teachers.  

His exams are hard but fair. He will never put anything on an exam that he has not gone over in class. His final is also very VERY fair. I would recommend buying the ""orgo II as a second language"" book because it goes hand in hand with his class (better than the actual text book)",470
montague-smith,2,,CHEM241,"I dropped out middle of the semester. Before I continue, I just want to clarify that I am not bitter about the professor, just on his teaching style. Of course there are a lot of things I personally could have improved on to do better but I really believe the major influence of me dropping was Smith's teaching style. As another reviewer pointed out, Smith is shockingly childish but very enthusiastic about subject material. He went on unnecessary tangents or stories from his personal life that really took focus away from what we were learning at the time even though the stories were slightly related to the material. His illustrations are awful and there were many instances where students had to butt in and tell him they can't read what he is writing. I also found that his extremely high level of energy was ironically distracting. 

I also suggest you do not take this class at the 1 hour and 15 minute slots. At least for me, the amount of information given in that span of time is overwhelming and it is unbearable once 45 minutes goes by and the only thing you think about is when the class if finally over. Grades were curved and averages fell at the F/D/ or C cutoff for the exams. 

At the same time, there were many students who did well, like a student who got a 100% raw on one of the exams so don't be discouraged if you are a stellar student. For me, his teaching style didn't really mesh, As a result, I had little motivation for studying and fell back on material (which as anyone in Orgo can tell you is the point of no return on catching up on material), forcing me to drop out. Again, I could have taken initiative and done better, but I don't think I would ever do well or get an A in a Montague classroom. ",470
montague-smith,1,B,CHEM241,"As a previous reviewer wrote, by the end of the semester, the class was booing and cheering on his command. This made lecture seem more like a comedy show and was both annoying and distracting. His interactions with students during class were at times outright rude. He went on tangents every class, which sometimes related to chemistry (dangerous chemicals he worked with as a grad student) but also included awkward sexual stories and the two years he lived in a tipi. 
I would've been able to accept his eccentricities if he was a good teacher, but he was not. The biggest challenge I had taking this class was that he did not give any practice problems throughout the semester, even though he and every professor knows that the best way to succeed in orgo is to do practice problems.

He called the exams ""cute little quizzes"" but he also made Orgo seem like drudgery instead of inspiring his class to want to learn. The harder parts of Orgo were ""bad news."" (Example: ""Do you want me to teach you this mechanism now?"" Class boos. ""Or should I let you out of class early?"" Class cheers.) Not the way I like to learn.

Lastly, I really liked how in Orgo I, Dixon showed the clear divisions of grades after each exam (this helped me get an A). M-S never did this and didn't even know when he was asked, which made it difficult knowing what grade I had in a curved class. ",470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM241,"This guy is very funny and a very good professor. By the end of the semester he had practically trained the whole class to boo and cheer on command. I didn't look at the book once during the semester and still did well. He has difficult exams but he will never put something on an exam he didn't cover before. His spectroscopy questions for the exam are usually much simpler than the ones you'll see in CHEM242. He wont give partial credit for some problems unless you clearly show your thought process. Also, as a side note you can get a synthesis entirely incorrect on the exam but still have it be correct. If you did it in a way that was not on the answer key you can still get full credit if you just explain your way to the professor. Your synthesis must be functionally correct though to receive credit.",470
montague-smith,5,B,CHEM241,"Overall he's a very good professor, has a good sense of humor, practice tests are very similar to current tests, and overall approachable. However it's pretty difficult to get an A in his class, but that can be said about all organic 2 classes. ",470
montague-smith,2,,CHEM241,"I can't stand this guy. He admits he's an overgrown child, and he is. He's hyper, easily distracted, puts up crappy lecture notes as scribbles on printer paper that he then projects, and is way too awake for 8am lecture. You can tell he's a shitty professor because he had to curve like 20% - he can barely teach.

He likes to tell weird stories and make chemistry feel far more sexual than it should be. I'm no prude, but it got to be annoying after a while. His TA was also irritating and unhelpful. Very little in the way of practice problems.

My least favorite part of his class was when he stated on the very first day of lecture that nothing he taught us in the class would ever be useful to us after we finished his final. Number 1, that is so untrue. Number 2, way to take away my motivation.

He's certainly very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, but he teaches it poorly. When I see orgo stuff now, it makes tons of sense, but on his exams it did not. Smart guy, just poorly socialized and a poor-to-mediocre lecturer. ",470
montague-smith,4,,CHEM241,"Dr. M-S is a great prof. He's funny, very nice and helpful in office hours, and does not have unrealistic expectations of his students as some other orgo profs do. My only criticism of him is that he does not give much partial credit. AT ALL. You have to have things pretty much close to perfect on his exams to get points. I highly recommend you copy his old exams - they are more helpful than the textbook.",470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM241,"I love Dr. MS!!! He's the first entertaining chemistry professor I've ever had, and he teaches well.  Every lecture we were all interested, even though it was at 8:00 in the morning.  I feel like I'm actually learning chemistry this time around.  (I dropped Khachick's class last semester because although I though I learned the material, the exam had nothing to do with what we covered in class).  If you have the opportunity, definitely take Montague-Smith.  ",470

montague-smith,3,,,"Dr. Montague is engaging and funny, but he did not seem to be particularly fond of teaching freshman. I learned almost nothing in lecture, and did all of my learning from the book. His lectures were really not helpful, and he got off on many tangents. That said, though, his tests were pretty straightforward - if you do practice problems in the book you'll be more than prepared. Towards the end of the semester, he started showing us some interesting molecules at the beginning of class which made the class more interesting. He makes a lot of awkward sexual chemistry jokes, which I guess requires a degree of talent, but if that kind of stuff doesnt offend you you should be fine. Given that he didnt require us to memorize a lot, or force through the end of the book because we didnt have time, he might be one of the better professors for CHEM135. But, be warned, do not let the simplicity of his lectures fool you - many calculations that he does not even mention in lecture, but are in the book, show up on the test.",470
montague-smith,3,A,CHEM135,"If you've taken AP Chem, this class is too easy with MS. Like the others said, hardly any memorization is needed. Skim through the chapters, make sure you can do the Mastering Chem hw, and you're good to go. Lectures become a waste of time (I just gave my clicker to my friends), and I never went to discussion/GSS. The final was 1/3 directly copied and pasted, and he gave us the titration problem beforehand. If you haven't had any chemistry for awhile, you're in trouble. Be prepared to teach yourself and study like crazyy!",470
montague-smith,5,A,,"Dr. M-S is super fair. His tests were exactly what we were prepared for: he very rarely had trick questions, and he tested the same concepts that he talked about in lecture. His jokes can be a little awkward at times, but he makes up for it by not expecting us to memorize any useless information.",470
montague-smith,2,C,CHEM135,"He's an engaging lecturer, but he really doesn't teach the material / prepare you for the tests well at all. He teaches concepts, and rarely does practice problems in class. His anecdotes are always entertaining however, and I rarely found myself bored in his class. I did find it moderately creepy, however, how he managed to make almost every subject in Chemistry awkwardly sexual. I wouldn't particularly advise taking him for CHEM135, but I'd imagine that there are worse teachers. Be prepared to put a lot of effort into the class, and do a lot of problems from the book (as he says in the syllabus).",470
montague-smith,4,A-,CHEM135,"One of the better professors for Chem135.  He doesn't require his students to memorize much; if it is found in a table in the book somewhere, chances are it will be given to you on the test.  The tests are pretty straightforward, and you will do well if you study.  A lot of my friends had other professors, and their tests were much harder, plus they were required to memorize a lot that I wasn't required to.",470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM135,"Pretty good professor. He doesn't make you memorize as many things like polyatomic ions, constants, formulas etc., and his tests are easier than other professors. Clicker questions almost every class, MasteringChemistry HW every week (completion grade), and he curves. Only (possible) downside is that he goes off on tangents in class and tells stories, which is entertaining to some and a waste of time to others.",470
montague-smith,5,B,CHEM231,"As much as I dreaded Organic, Dr. M-S was a fantastic teacher. His teaching method seemed slightly erratic but it was ultimately effective for me. He sprinkled his lectures with hilarious stories which helped make him one of the best overall lecturers I have had to date.",470
montague-smith,1,B,CHEM231,"This guy is a real windbag. For starters, his lecture notes would serve better purpose as back-up toilet paper. They are basically random molecules or reactions that he pulls out of a hat all scrambled down onto a piece of paper - poorly with no apparenty logic or reason. This man killed any possible inherent interest in the chemical sciences I ever had. He is like this big goofy 57 year old clown who isnt funny at all. I consider myself a good student (90 transfer credits on a 3.8 GPA) and this guy blew my f*cking mind. He is a real self esteem killer - and his tests are unreasonable as he gives you no way of practicing for them. He gives out a piece of paper with ""recommended problems"" on it from the book, all of which I did and still felt remarkably unprepared for his tests. I got a B somehow, and I can sit here and honestly say that I know no more about orgo than I did when I walked in. He is the most disorganized moron of a teacher I have ever had the displeasure of having, and his ass needs to retire. I basically wanted to kick him in the fatch on a daily basis. If you have no other choice but to sign up for this guy then I'd recommend setting CHEM231 aside for the time being and staring at your ass in the mirror for 50 minutes three times a week - you would learn just as much about orgo as coming to this jerks class. I feel as if I wasted my money and time, and I did put in an honestly diligent effort to learn the material. INFURIATING. 


PS - if you really want to piss him off tell him that chemists are people that flaked out on a physics degree (the only real scientist). ",470
montague-smith,4,B,CHEM231,"This guy was the reason for my only B. Haha actually, well I can take part for that. Montague-Smith is awesome. But his handwriting is bad and his lectures are all over the place. Discussion helps and so did GSS. You learn a lot from this class; my biggest advice is to study reactions and reagents. 
Montague-Smith doesn't lie about what is gonna be exams, but he is also not that specific. Don't get the wrong impression when he tells you that a lot of the final is copy and pasted questions from the previous exams. Though there are some, its not as much as I thought there would be. 
I would pick Montague-Smith though, he is the man",470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM231,The Man.,470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM241,"I was initially not quite used to Dr. M-S's style of teaching, but in retrospect, I think he was an effective, straightforward teacher who was reasonable and most of all, very fun. His exams are challenging, yes, but definitely manageable with adequate studying. Also, he gives you a mechanism list to memorize. His test format is always the same, with 15-20 reactions, 1-2 mechanisms, 1-2 syntheses and 1-2 specs. He obviously knows a whole lot about orgo and biochem, and you can tell that he's really excited about this stuff. At the end of the semester he gives a very generous curve, with the high 70s being an A.",470
montague-smith,4,B,CHEM241,"Professor Montague-Smith is a fantastic professor for a difficult class. He gives you 5 minute breaks during the one hour and 15 minute class, tells jokes and anecdotes to help you remember reactions, and explains mechanisms thoroughly. Also, if you take the time out to meet with him, if you improve throughout the semester you will get a good grade. His tests are difficult but as long as you review your notes, he tells you exactly what to study for the exams. My only complaint is that he writes his notes on the overhead projector and sometimes it is difficult to read what he writes. However, if you ask what he just wrote, he will attempt to correct it so it is easier to read.",470
montague-smith,5,,BCHM461,"Great professor. Fun to attend lecture. I love his thing about including a break in this 1.25 hour long classes. Really helps. His exams are ok, not too bad. He tells you exactly what mechanism is going to be on it so you know what to study. Oh, also you may want to check his structures. He tends to get them wrong in little places because he's so excited about teaching it. ",470
montague-smith,5,A,BCHM461,"I really liked Dr. MS's style of teaching biochemistry, which is his actual specialty.  He writes out notes on the overhead, so its easy to take notes with him throughout lecture. He was very clear as to which mechanisms would be tested and he often gave examples of test questions after finishing various topics.  He added humor to what could otherwise be a dull topic. ",470
montague-smith,5,A-,CHEM271,"Dr. M-S is a really cool, funny, and an easily approachable professor. His lectures were very clear and he always writes everything he says up on the overhead projector so it should be very easy to copy notes in his class. However, he does say some important stuff (what will be on the next exam or on the final, what you HAVE to know, and any other side information) that he does not write on the overhead. I highly recommend him for ANY chemistry course, whether it may be General Chemistry I (CHEM131), Organic Chemistry I or II (CHEM231, CHEM241), General Chemistry II (CHEM271), or Biochemistry I (BCHM461). You will not regret it.",470
montague-smith,5,A-,CHEM231,Taught Orgo I really well. Really funny and makes the class enjoyable. His tests are hard but doable. He gave a really generous curve at the end. ,470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM231,"He's an excellent Orgo teacher; I've heard otherwise for his CHEM 2 class. Anyway, he's engaging, interesting, and knows his stuff. His tests are somewhat difficult, but not unnecessarily hard. It is a difficult class, but that's the nature of the class. He really pushes you, so be ready to work if you're taking the class.",470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM241,He is my favorite professor ever!!! ,470
montague-smith,5,A,CHEM241,"He's my favorite! 
Pros: Lectures are structured and include a break in the middle, expectations/exams are straightforward, and he's passionate and so delightful.
Cons: You'll get used to his handwriting it's not that bad; some say he's intimidating but it's not his fault he's super tall. 
Verdict: Take him you will love him.",470
montague-smith,5,A+,CHEM241,"Fantastic orgo professor.  My favorite teacher at the university yet. Love this guy.  Hilarious, and tells everything that you need to know about what you’ll be tested on.  he doesn’t keep you in the dark and he is very transparent about what he expects from you, which I appreciated.  He tells stories before and during class, with a molecule of the day in the beginning.  He’s got some great stories.  The man is one of the most interesting guys out there.  You have to work hard of course, but I believe that anyone can succeed in MS’s class if you put the time in.  that’s the key to orgo 2: time.  If you’re not willing to give time, then you will not get the grade you want.  He is very systematic in the way that he tests, meaning the format of his tests have not changed a bit since 2011.  That’s the other great thing about this semester: he posted all of his old exams since 2011!  So all I did was practice those and then got A’s on the test.  Sounds easy now, but doing ALL those tests takes time and perseverance .  There’s also no answer keys for them so you have to check with friends.  TA andrea was amazing and I loved her commentary during discussion…”we’ll just jones up this bad boy.”  Stuff like that.  really classic and genuine person.  He’s definitely your best bet for orgo 2 and I would be so down to take bchm with him in the future if he ever teaches it.  I came from having Dixon for orgo 1, so I was used to the office hours ‘fun’.  It’s not like that with MS.  He likes his space and sees students one at a time at office hours, so you don’t really get to know him on that personal level like you would if you took Dixon and were hardworking enough to be part of her squad.  Overall, highly recommend MS.  You’ll have to work hard, but remember that most pre med kids know to take him, so getting around 85% of the total points in his class usually serves to get you an A-.  this means the curve is quite small.   it’ll be a competitive group, but you can do it.  goodluck",470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM241,"Love him. The key to success is his practice exams. Accidentally YOLOed last night and missed class? No worries, just go through his old exams. Super animated professor and tells funny stories and jokes too.",470
montague-smith,2,,CHEM241,"I thought his online lectures were very boring and monotone. He was not sympathetic to student concerns. Online exams are entirely multiple choice, so there's no chance of getting partial credit. Maybe he's better for live class, but I would not recommend him for online class.",470
montague-smith,5,,CHEM241,"Dr. MS is a terrific professor. Although the material and the exams are difficult, he is such a nice guy and a is very compassionate towards his students and his job as a professor. I would HIGHLY recommend taking his class for Orgo 2, he is one of the most genuine and passionate professors out there. (p.s. He tells some of the best stories and shares some of the coolest information throughout the semester)",470
girvan,3,B,PHYS260,"She's kind of hard to follow when doing examples since her writing is kind of small and disorganized. She also hands out pretty hard exams. That said, she's pretty nice and cares for her students. ",471
hugue,3,B,CMSC420,"Meesh... I have no idea how I feel about her as a professor and whether or not I recommend her for 420. 

Pros
- You may not have to attend a single class besides exams
- She gives out project extensions always
- She genuinely cares about her students and about you succeeding
- The exams are really fair - since they cover a lot of material you are bound to do well unless you don't know anything at all
- She calculates your grade a bunch of different ways and picks the best one
- If you do well on the first two parts of the project and both midterms you can skip the third part of the project as well as the final and still get  a good grade

Cons
- The project is pretty hard and time consuming
- You won't learn that much from going to lectures due to her ADD/Dislexia. Wish she recorded her lectures because she actually is really good at it when she's lecturing and not telling stories
- You won't learn that much about data structures if you take it with her

Overall, it depends if you like teaching yourself everything or if you like learning by going to lectures. I prefer the latter and think I may have been happier if I took the course with someone else. I will say that Meesh is an awesome person and with a few small modifications I think she could improve the class. It wasn't necessarily hard but it definitely wasn't easy either. You'll have to put in considerable work (at least on the project) to do well",473
hugue,5,,CMSC420,She is responsible to her students and is always willing to help. The project was ambitious but interesting! Design a Google Map by yourself!,473
hugue,5,A,CMSC420,"Ok first let me say I am graduating right now and I am currently working for Google and I took Meesh for my CMSC 411(fall 2013) and 420 (summer 2014). On my job interview( for Google) the interviewer asked me about how did i do in Meesh classes? I am just telling that to let you know guys she is really famous. Yea she has ADD and she is talking about her life during the class but trust me all of the material she is covering are going to help you a loooooooot. Yes her Exam are really long and long and long but there are lots of materials that you know about them and you can get points for that. trust me take her class go to the lectures and study the materials she is giving to you!
(Also there are some links like UNIX tutorial which I found it really useful take advantage of those too in your free time.

If you are not working hard and dont try to teach yourself trust me you dont have any place in computer science world ",473
hugue,4,A+,CMSC420,"Lecture: 
So Meesh has ADD and at first you might think ""Why bother coming to lecture since she just goes off on random tangents all the time?"" Well you should go to lecture because:
1) I actually learned a lot during lecture, not sure how, but I learned, the ADD moments might have actually kept me somewhat engaged and 
2) the ADD (at least for my semester) seemed to start off terrible and get better as the semester progressed. 

Projects:
So you are essentially writing MapQuest (well a low key version anyway). The project is broken into 3 parts and builds on itself throughout the semester. You really need to do well on the first part so that you have a good idea of what is going on, people who slacked on Part I were at a great disadvantage for Parts II and III. 
The project will take a lot of time, but won't be particularly difficult so long as you do the readings and understand the data structures you are creating. I can't stress this enough: THE PROJECT WILL TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME!!!

Exams:
If you read the other reviews you will notice that her exams are really really long. Use this to your advantage, if you don't understand a question just skip it, there is no point wasting time trying to decipher a question. I would also suggest never asking questions during the exam, it takes too much time and you could be answering questions you know the answer to instead of waiting for an explanation from the TAs or Meesh. Don't worry, she curves like crazy, I had something like a 78% and got an A.

Book:
Meesh posts a lot of stuff on her website. Use those resources, they are very helpful. Do the readings, they will really help you understand the intricacies of the data structures (and sometimes provide pseudocode).

Misc:
I took the summer version of the course, which had the projects shortened slightly, but topic coverage was the same. I also worked 20 hours a week at my job while taking this course and managed an A (although I spent almost all my non-work/non-class time working on the projects). ",473
hugue,1,A,CMSC420,"This professor does not teach,she uses years worth of material stored and maintained by TA's in lieu of teaching.  Time is spent performing administrative tasks in class, telling stories, cancelling class, and talking about how much she ""cares.""  The truth is she doesn't care because students are walking away from her class thinking they have a good understanding of the concepts taught.  With a general bit of knowledge and the heavy curving on the tests you would have a tough time failing tests even if you tried.  Don't waste your time with this professor if you want to be successful in the field, use your time with professors like Dave Mount or Samir Khuller.  ",473
hugue,2,B+,CMSC250,"This class was one of the more boring/frustrating ones that I have taken here at UMD.  It seemed like the curriculum we covered was just all over the place, and I didnt feel like I learned much at all from this class.  The graduate teaching assistants for this class were not good at all; they didnt care very much about the students and were horrible at grading exams.  A lot of people found 5-10 points worth of mistakes on each of the exams, in addition to the fact that many of the points awarded were subject to the grader's own opinion, rather than actually getting a right/wrong answer.  
As for Dr. Hugue, most of the stuff mentioned below is true.  She is pretty crazy, which can make the class funny at times but will also annoy you to no end if you actually are confused about something and want to learn the material.  In lecture it seemed as though she just went over random topics with no real sense of organization or purpose.  I had to teach myself everything for the assignments and exams.  She is a really nice person who will listen to you after class and respond promptly to email.  If I had to choose over again Id take this class with Perlis, because I learned more from him the one time I was in his lecture than I did all year in Dr. Hugue's lecture.",473
hugue,3,,CMSC250,"Hugue...oh boy. I thought the subject matter of 250 was pretty boring to begin with, and Hugue didn't change my mind. Lectures start off with a TA teaching for the first few minutes, then Hugue going over slides mixed in with random stories about her life. 

Homework is easy, about 20 minutes a week, and quizzes are just as easy, as long as you've done the homework and stayed semi-conscious in lecture.

Tests are okay, alot of partial credit, which is great if you mess up on a proof.

Hugue isn't great but compared to the other professors I'd prefer her. From what I hear the other 250 professors are like Hugue minus the stories in lecture, and that's the only thing keeping me from falling into comas during lecture. Also, she's much nicer than the other professors. She wants the class to do well and promises to curve/give partial credit/etc. if it will help the class.",473
hugue,2,A,CMSC351,"She's just not a good teacher. I'll agree she's a very understanding person and I like her exam style, but we should have gotten way more out of 351 than we did. I didn't enroll in 351 to hear Meesh talk about random stories from her life for the entire class. It's great when professors can provide relevant anecdotes to the material that they're teaching, but Meesh just provided anecdotes about whatever happened to pop into her strange mind at the time.
At least the class is really easy though. I mean we only had 4 hws and one small project, which just goes to show you how little we learned.",473
hugue,4,A+,CMSC351,"This was my second time having Meesh. She is complicated. I'm a firm believer that a professor is not defined purely by his or her lecture skills, and since she's not your average professor, I have to break this down a little.

Lectures: Tough to follow. If you learn purely through lectures, you might want to avoid her classes.

Exams: Long, but fair. She does not penalize you very much for missing small details. Just don't ever get caught up on one problem. If it takes you too long, skip it.

Homework and projects: Also pretty fair. She doesn't seem to believe in secret tests. She isn't as forgiving about stupid mistakes on homework as she is on exams.

Accommodations: Seriously amazing. Is your life hard? Do you have other things going on? Do you mess up sometimes, and does that one bad day sometimes ruin your entire grade for a class? Congratulations, Meesh acknowledges that you are human! That test you took half-asleep and sick and stressed beyond belief? Dropped. That homework you couldn't do because you had so much going on outside of this class? Dropped. That day you have two projects due and two homework assignments due and two exams? Meesh is the professor who will give you an extension.

Disabilities: If you have any sort of disability it is really nice to have a professor who understands. Meesh will be the first person to realize that you're not stupid; your brain just works differently. ",473
hugue,2,A,CMSC351,"really guys! I am puzzled, how could anyone give Meesh 5 stars?? Granted her ""lectures"" can be entertaining but you don't learn anything. She just sits on her fat ass and tells you stories. Her rare efforts to actually teach result in a tirade of nonsense. The only times I've learned anything in her class are when the TA took over.

She often comes to class late, and occasionally even misses the entire class. She doesn't even write up her own notes. 

I am a math, physics, and cs major and in all my classes I've learned one thing - that the CS department needs to do an overhaul of their professors. And the first thing they should do is fire Dr. Hugue.",473
hugue,1,D,,"She doesn't teach anything. She just sends an email before every midterm listing what you're supposed to have taught yourself. And she isn't that generous with partial credit. I got zero points on one page even though I showed work. Just saying.

I'm not one to go to office hours just to buddy up with a teacher. I just don't have time or heart for that. So I can tell you that she actually doesn't give a damn about you unless do that. Won't even answer your emails. 

Anyway, I read the book, did my best on the labs, and still failed. Just another perspective. Thanks for reading.",473
hugue,2,,,"Dr. Hugue, like any other professor will not 'hold your hand' through the coursework. You'll be expected to study the course material and apply it in projects and tests. However, unlike most professors, Dr. Hugue spends most of the class period telling stories about former students who now work for big software companies (google, microsoft, etc) and  other irrelevant information. My advice is to go to class for the quizzes but not to expect anything out of her.",473
hugue,5,A,,"It's funny how many times people can say this, but be forewarned: Meesh does not teach you by holding your hand in lecture. You are expected to *gasp* read the friendly book! 

Now I know this is crazy for us computer science majors, and some of us get frustrated initially by Meesh's style. But know this: Meesh does have your best interests in mind. 

If you like your predictable, vanilla boring professor don't take Meesh. If you want an adventure and can motivate yourself to learn the material on your own with pointers from an instructor -- go for Meesh.",473
hugue,5,,,"Meesh doesn't teach much, but she cares about students. Tests are long but not too hard, and OMG at the partial credits she gave. Imagine a 3 point true false question, its funny that you could get 1 point for getting the wrong answer...",473
hugue,5,B,,"I have had Meesh for 3 classes CMSC311, CMSC351 and CMSC420. Yeah that's right 3! And if she taught any others I would take them.

First to address the complaints from people
1) She doesn't teach - Oh god she doesn't stand in front and read from the slides THE HORROR. She actually teaches you to learn on your own. She doesn't leave you totally helpless. She gives you all the resources you will ever need and tells you what to look at and what you need to know. She even sends out emails before a test or quiz telling you what you need to study. Also if you didn't talk about it in class it wont be on the test, simple as that.
2) She is crazy - If you are taking a computer science class with Meesh then you are in a major with a lot of crazy people, deal with it. Besides it makes the class more interesting.
3) Her exams are looooong - Her average 311 exam is about 1.4 times the length of what it would normally be to finish in a normal amount of time. This is actually to your advantage because say her test is out of 200 points originally and you got a 120. What she does is let you keep that 120 but adjusts the total to say 130 and now you have an A+. She has adjusted the totals to a point where some people get above 100% and they get to keep that grade. Her long exams also allow you to answer what you know. Don't know anything on page 2 of the exam? Skip it, you have 18 other pages to possibly answer a question. 

Other positives
1) Her TA's - because many students love Meesh they will come back to TA for her. She usually knows these students very well. This means they are the best TA's in computer science. I'm talking about nice people you can talk to and they can generate the implementation for an entire PR quadtree in their heads (420 structure)
2) Her Grading - PARTIAL CREDIT, omg the level of partial credit is amazing. I have gotten points for writing totally wrong answers that other teachers would give a 0 for. This goes for projects and almost anything else as well. If you have three tests she also drops the lowest one (this also applies to HW's and quizzes)
3) The projects - They are real world things you might actually do once you get out of school. Designing structures, reverse engineering programs, efficiency of different searches. Actual useful things; not the theory stuff that some teachers try to put in their class.

She knows her stuff and loves teaching, and loves her students. Best teacher I will have at UMD",473
hugue,1,,MATH220,"Terrible. She may be a nice lady but shes a nervous wreck half the time and I just could not deal with her, so I switched teachers. Do not take her class. ",473
hugue,4,A,MATH220,"Meesh is an awesome woman with a great personality. Take her Math220 class if you've already taken calculus or you are good at learning on your own. Though I attended every class, only 50 people would show up on average out of 150 students.

Meesh says she has ADD and dyslexia, which I believe from listening to her lectures. It was almost impossible to learn from her notes, so I did a lot of outside studying which wasn't difficult. 

She really does care about her students and enjoys making us laugh and making us happy. I would recommend her for those who have taken calc before and have a good basis for learning more. ",473
hugue,2,B,MATH220,"She is an extremely nice woman and wants her students to do well BUT!!!!! she is the worst math teacher I have ever had.  If you're good at teaching yourself math than this is a good class for you.  She claims to have ADD and be Dyslexic.   She really doesn't teach, she is all over the board, and I really don't have clear notes from the class.  She tells funny stories and is really nice.  She wants her students to do well, she drops a lot of quizzes and homeworks.  However, I would have been able to do much better with a different teacher.  I got to the point where after the second exam i started going to different lectures because hers were useless.  

She has the potential to be a good teacher, but definitely not for math.",473

Her teaching style isn't for everyone, but I find you can extrapolate your compatibility with her from the prior reviews.

Bottom line is: SHE CARES. She wants you to succeed and she'll fight tooth and nail for her students.

This review isn't nearly as long or as passionate as it should be, but I think the others get it across nicely.",473
hugue,5,A-,,"The things that people get scared of with Meesh is:

1). She doesn't teach
2). Her exams
3). She's crazy

1). She does get sidetracked often with stories, most of which have some life-meaning to them (other times she's just being silly). Yet don't think you won't get ANYTHING out of her. She does know the material but you are expected to learn most of it from the book. If you go to class she'll help you. Oh, and don't be intimidated by her snide-ness. Most of the time it's not because of you!

2). Her exams...midterm was about 25 pages of questions and final was about 35 pages. Yes it's painful. However she follows her format of easy questions first, hard questions last. Her exams are two packets, one of which she grades herself. She reads everything you write, so always write something for her questions! The only way to get a zero on a question is if you don't answer it! The point of the exams is to show what you know and she often asks the same question in different ways, so there's lots of opportunities to get points for knowing your bits :) She is referred to as the queen of partial credit.

Oh and she curves...usually a 60% is an A on her exams.

3). Yes she's crazy...but she cares for her students. I promise that.


Misc: The book is helpful. Often problems on quizzes and exams come right from the book's problems! The labs (projects) are pretty cool IMO. Sometimes they can be downright frustrating, but Meesh and the TAs keep that in mind.

All in all Meesh is a professor who wants her students to do well in the field. She gives great advice and knows a lot of people who work in Google, Microsoft, etc.

You can never get screwed over by Meesh in terms of grades.",473
hugue,1,A,,"I agree with everyone here, in that she cares about her students and wants them to do well.  I would like to give a good review, but unfortunately I'm unable to delude myself enough to do so.

Her lectures usually comprised of the following : 10-30 minutes of content, 30-50 minutes of unrelated stories, 15 minutes talking about her teaching philosophy.  The content was explained relatively well.  However questions usually resulted in mockery (although not in mean way).  The unrelated stories were really not useful in any way for me and I'm surprised that other people here took something away from them.  She seemed hell bent on divulging every last bit of personal information about herself and others, almost always unprompted.  On several occasions she made the entire class pretty uncomfortable with her stories.  The part of the lectures which I disliked the most was when she talked about her teaching style.  Her philosophy is based on the idea that not everyone learns the same way.  While this is a valid point, her solution was essentially to all but eliminate the lecture aspect of the course.  Her goal was to shift more of the learning responsibility onto the individual.  However, she mostly succeeded in wasting the time of those who went to lecture and in stripping the students of a valuable resource (a teacher!).  It especially bothered me how often she would bash the teaching methods of other (specific) profs and glorify those of her own, during the time when she should actually be teaching!!

That said, I loved the projects (labs) for this course.  The quizzes were pretty fair.  The tests were rather difficult and long, and I'm not really sure how I feel about them.

Could have been be a great class if the teacher had actually made use of the lecture time.",473
hugue,5,,,"As a number of reviewers have pointed out, much of her lectures seem to be spent on stories about her life or her former students. Yet I found myself learning the required material from the lectures too, all the while enjoying the stories along the way. While at times lectures may seem 'wasted', her teaching style worked well for me in the end. I got along well with her as a professor, and I enjoyed going to class. I also found myself paying more attention to her lectures (be it during stories or actual teaching moments) than I did other professors, which probably contributed to being able to learn more from her than others.

Beyond her lectures, she was hands down the most helpful professor I have had, both within class/office hours and outside of these times, when she is easily accessible through a number of means. Her replies are always speedy and helpful, and you can tell that she truly does care about her students.

While her style of teaching may not be a good fit for everyone, she is easily one of the best professors I have had at this University.",473
hugue,4,,,"Projects aren't too tough - 4 throughout the semester.  Quizzes and exams aren't difficult, but they require you to think fast and to write fast.  If you're a careful test-taker and like to look over your work numerous times, then you'll have a difficult time adjusting to her exams because they are huge packets.  To maximize your chances of doing well, you need to spam the exams as much as possible as she gives plenty of partial credit - don't waste time checking over your answers and attempt every single page.  Didn't learn much from lectures - learned most of the material from the book or doing her/TA's worksheets.  She's a nice person who wants you to do well, and she's very fair.",473
hugue,2,C,,"You will not learn anything from her lectures, except about her personal life and former students who now work for Google and Microsoft. She uses CMU's slides, CMU's textbook, and her TAs write the projects. However, she really does want her students to do well and she's really fair with grading. Unfortunately, for slow, careful test-takers such as myself, her extremely long tests and quizzes are hell.",473
hugue,5,B,,One of the few teachers in the department that really cares about her students.  She  will do far more for you in class and out just to make sure you are generally doing well.  Her stories are hilarious and her lectures are entertaining.  Awesome teacher!,473
hugue,5,,,"Unorthodox but very worthwhile teacher--I learned a ton.  You will have to read the textbook sometimes, but the lectures are not as wasteful as they may seem.

I personally feel that I learn better when I have a rapport with the professor, which is easy to do with Dr. Hugue.

Strongly recommended.",473
hugue,4,A,,"Meesh is a great professor. She keeps class interesting, she keeps class entertaining, and most of all, she manages to teach the material (as a previous reviewer said, ""somehow."")

Yes, a lot of the class will be spent on jokes and her personal life. But in the end, you will learn more than with 75% of the other professors, and you will actually like going to class.

Also, her exams are very long. If you're  a fast test taker, then this is fine. If you're not that fast, then this might be a little scary, but they're not too bad (they are very sharply curved.)",473
hugue,5,A,,"Michelle Hugue is one of my favorite teachers at the University of Maryland so far, and is, along with Nelson Padua-Perez, probably tied for my favorite computer science teacher. By keeping class entertaining, in a way that only she could, ""Meesh"" has taught me, and the rest of the class, an enormous amount about low level programming, without most of us even realizing it happened. Additionally, she has been very responsive every time I talked to her after class. She never ceases to amuse and is always enlightening. Have fun!",473
hugue,3,B-,,"Pretty interesting person but that is about it.  You will not learn anything from her... you will have to learn it on your own.  This isn't so much a bad thing, but it makes you feel like you waste going to class.  Half of her class time is spent telling stories while the other half is spent with her somewhat teaching the material.

Tests are extremely long and hard... she curves the test using a bell curve pretty much.  Projects are interesting but she isn't very helpful if you need help, use the TAs.  Quizzes are very easy but do not prepare you well for her exams.  One more thing:  read the instructions on her assignments and exams, and answer every possible question you can on the exam (she gives some partial credit for somewhat sensible answers)!",473
hugue,4,A,,"One of the most interesting professors I have had at Maryland.  She knows the material well and she cares a lot about how her students do, both in the class and in life.  However, she often goes off on tangents and talks about her personal life.  Some people like this and some hate it.  Her tests are very strange; she gives you extremely long tests that almost no one finishes and curves them insanely.  For example, about a 60% is an A.  So as long as you focus on what you know, and know most of the material, you'll do fine.  There are also a lot of pretty fun projects.",473

hugue,3,B-,CMSC420,this class is hard as hell. She doesn't come to class. So all of the lectures were on google hangout. Really struggled in class,473
hugue,5,B+,CMSC411,"Perfect professor to take if you want to simply pass the class. I studied 3 days before both midterms and did perfectly fine. The exams are very long and you aren't expected to finish them. However, you should attempt to write something for every single question because you will get partial credit as long as it's not blank. The class is online now so you are given a ton of readings/videos and one homework to turn in each week. I never read any articles or watched any videos. The homeworks are graded for completion and are worth 5% of your grade. To study, simply read over the answers to the homeworks. As long as you know a little bit of the material, you should be completely fine. To pass, you need a 55%, which is incredibly easy to achieve. ",473
hugue,1,A,CMSC411,"Meesh is not a teacher. Meesh is a course coordinator. She sends students on a scavenger hunt looking for course material and then expects them to complete massive exam packets as if we learned enough from her to be able to complete even a portion of them. Instead of providing recorded lectures or even lecture notes, she links to other professors' lectures (I don't think she got permission), and random articles that are completely irrelevant to the questions she asks on examinations. She is very lazy and refuses to answer small questions because she answered them before, and you have to find them on her out of date ELMS pages. When I asked her a question about how things were being handled due to the move online (COVID-19), she gave an extremely rude response, giving the excuse that these things should be obvious when they are clearly not. Just the worst experience I have ever had in a class at Maryland. In fact its not a class, its paying close to 2000$ for the right to take exams. ",473
hugue,2,P,CMSC411,"Meesh is an enigma. This was the first semester that 411 was fully taught online. We weren't able to learn anything in the first week of classes because she didn't know how to hyperlink her files in ELMS. All Piazza questions were answered vaguely and in long mistyped formats that usually included her having conversations with herself before arriving at an ""answer"" which was usually copied and pasted from the syllabus (which was also confusing and vague). She had weekly worksheet assignments that you would submit on Gradescope. All her weekly ""lectures"" were readings from the book and YouTube videos. She never actually lectured or recorded herself lecturing and when students asked about this and if she could lecture she would respond with a very long and confusing post ultimately saying that she didn't think it was necessary and we should use our skills as students to use our resources (YouTube) to teach ourselves. 

If you actually watch the YouTube videos, you will learn something. I found it interesting and actually learned a bit but there was no real use for it as the exams were almost copy and paste from her practice exam and the weekly worksheets. However, you won't have enough time to finish the exams because they are 30 pages long. She doesn't expect anyone to finish the exam and grades it based on the highest score. She also drops an exam including the final. You won't fail this class, but you might not learn from it and more than likely will be confused and get a headache if you actually have questions for her. I spent a solid 4 weeks not knowing what was going on and I'm pretty sure she didn't know what was going on either.",473
hugue,4,A,CMSC411,"Pros:
* prof answers questions on piazza
* prof provides good practice problems
* easy to get an A in the class (or at least very difficult to fail) because there's five different grading methods (your final grade in the class is max of all five possible final grades) and you will get at least one point for each question that is answered on an exam (ie you can only get a zero for a question if you leave it completely blank).
* class is curved

Con:
* in lieu of lectures, the prof provides several links to mostly relevant material so this course is purely self-taught",473

Grading was slow, the tests (6 of them) were all about 20 pages long and take home over three days, and the questions were always somewhere between confusing and trivia. Course materials weren't much better, and piazza responses to fair questions were rude, if they were answered at all. I don't recommend you take any class with Meesh. ",473

hugue,1,B,CMSC411,"This is the first time that 411 was taught fully online from start to finish and..... It was not a fun time at all. Friends of mine said this was a relatively easy class because you just go to lecture and take the 2 exams. But this class is online. From the beginning, Dr.Hugue posts weekly short worksheets with the answers, youtube videos by another professor at a different university, 5-10 pages from the textbook that won't help you on the exam at all, quizzes that are very vague and don't really cover the material on the exam, and with a cherry on top, doesn't lecture at all. Within the first week many students including myself had asked her how we were supposed to study for the exams, and many students including myself either were told to look at the given course material, or never received a response. There were 6 ""short tests"" (In reality they were 6 part tests with 1 being 20 multiple choice questions and the other 5 were 8-15 open response questions with a sentence or more each). She only grades the 5 highest tests too. I will at least say that the course material does help you to answer 3-5 questions on the exam. But that leaves pretty much 90% of the exam to be answered by googling questions for 8-12 hours in order to get a B on each test. I have to assume that if she would just hold lectures that it wouldn't be this bad, but since she either doesn't know how to do remote lectures or make lecture videos, your pretty much left to google all the answers for the tests. On the bright side you can pass the class with a 55% because that is her cut off for a C-.",473

The exams take hours to complete, if you want an A then be prepared to spend well over 80 hours doing independent research to complete them through the semester.

Speaking of conflicting information, her notes/worksheet answers are just straight up incorrect sometimes.

hugue,1,A,CMSC411,This course should have been foundational to my computer science learning but the way the course was executed was below average. The grading policy was changed from the syllabus after the she discovered the one on the syllabus was not an accurate reflection of our scores (it would curve us down). Worksheets used for learning had answer keys with several mistakes. There were no concrete course materials to rely on as each week we were sent links (some of which didn't work) and those links did not help very much with the worksheets or tests. I'd say we were actually taught nothing through this course and that the process of doing the exams (which were open note and internet) was the only way a student could learn and students would have to google their own resources because the given class resources were hardly helpful aside from SOME of the worksheet answer keys (which as I mentioned earlier were poorly explained examples and contained several inaccuracies). Her responses to genuine questions on piazza were rather defensive which made many students not want to ask her questions. The tests determined 90% of our grades were so long-- I spent over 24 hours working on the last test and at least 12 hours on all the other ones (there were 6 short tests that were all 12+ pages). I guess I could summarize the course in that it wasn't necessarily hard but it required students to go far above what they needed to. It felt like she was not the professor of this course and that we did not have a professor at all. ,473

Anyone on here giving above a 1 star is just happy to pass the class with minimal effort, but as someone who also wanted to learn a little bit this was a complete waste of my time and tuition. I was warned all of this before taking the class but ignored it all because I wanted an easy passing grade, and here I am writing the only review I have ever felt the need to write.

But as the semester went on I felt like he lightened up and we got him to laugh a few times. 

What's really nice about Anismov is that he lets you bring whatever you want to the exam, and he even tells you whats going to be on the exam! So definitely show up the day before the exam to find out what questions are going to be on it, and then solve them at home or work on them with other people, and then bring them to the exam and you should be all set. Be sure to bring the textbook and homeworks to the exam. His exams were not difficult, and on the easier side. He had pop quizzes in our class, so be sure to pay attention in class, as that's usually what they were based on.

anisimov,1,B,,"As stated below, Dr. Anisimov chooses to teach this class via PowerPoint. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for most people, but the fact that there were errors all over the slides created an obvious disparity between his notes and the book itself. At times, the formulas that he would provide us in his lectures were incorrect, compared to the ones given by the book, and students would suffer point losses on his exams because of the mistakes that Dr. Anisimov made while making the PowerPoint.

Dr. Anisimov is not a person that I would remotely find suitable to teach an undergraduate course, especially one of such importance to our post-graduate careers. He incessantly finds the need to criticize students for their lack of ""common"" knowledge, and finds it unnecessary to explain himself further, since the material is ""easy"".

anisimov,1,F+,,"Transport Processes II (Mass and Heat Transfer) is a difficult course to begin with, no matter how great the teacher is.  From what I heard, Dr. Calabrese was a very strict and demanding teacher, but he actually taught you the material and you understood it if you tried in his course.  The exact opposite is true for Dr. Anisimov.  First, he teaches this course ENTIRELY with powerpoint.  Powerpoint is widely considered among the undergraduate body to be the absolute worst way to teach a technical course, as derivations and example problems are lost and students scramble to copy everything down.  There are some anomalies to this generalization (see Dr. Raghavan's ENCH440 course), but Dr. Anisimov's powerpoint slides for this course are perhaps the best example for this negative generalization.  First off, he would take examples from the book, change the notation (which is INCREDIBLY confusing), and jam 5 pages worth of derivation and math onto 1 slide, skipping all the steps that he could do in his head.  Since the man has a PhD in chemical physics, it's safe to say that he can do a lot of high level math in his head that not all undergraduate students are capable of doing, and skipping several steps and changing notation from the book makes it very difficult to keep up with it.  Also, his slides contained a plethora of mistakes, whether they be typos, him forgetting to maintain his changed notation, or gross errors in mathematics simplification.  The errors were numerous and very misleading, as they confused us more than the slides helped us.  Dr. Anisimov also is not what I would call a considerate man, as he was constantly condescending to the class and singled students out and would sometimes berate them for not knowing how to do something that he could barely explain to us.  He also seemed to get angry when anyone would ask a question to clarify something, saying things like ""What do you not understand? This is common sense.""  Finally, I think the worst thing about Dr. Anisimov's class was that he did not teach us anything that we can use in our post-undergraduate careers, except the basic concepts of mass and heat transfer.  We never needed to derive any kind of equation explaining how temperature or concentration changes, which I feel is the main point of the course as it was in Transport Processes I.  I feel that Dr. Anisimov teaching this course has put me at a severe disadvantage for competing with other chemical engineering graduates from other Universities.  I would not recommend any course he taught, no matter how interesting it would be, to anyone because he is no doubt the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire 18 years of schooling.",475

When the average is only 3 points away from failing..someone isn't doing their job.  This man is rude and makes fun of students and says that all material is ""simple."" This material is NOT ""simple!""

teli,4,B+,CMSC351,Spring 19' was the first semester Teli didn't just use all of Kruskal's materials. The lectures were straightforward and the exams were fair and manageable. ,479
teli,5,B,CMSC351,"Great, engaging lecturer who put an emphasis on applying the algorithms. Also covered some algorithms not in Kruskal's. Funny guy who is easy to talk to.

Curved about 8-10%",479
teli,2,A+,CMSC351,"Energetic and caring professor, but very sloppy. If you're after rigor, don't take Teli. He spends far more time in lecture reviewing algebra than teaching computer science, and when he does get around to explaining some theory, he mostly just waves his hands.

That being said, he is likely an easy A. Take that as you will.",479
teli,4,A,CMSC426,"His class is in Python, the projects are substantial, try to work in groups. Teli's explanations are pretty match-heavy, and it's easy to drown in the math. But he still gives his best effort to explain concepts.",479
teli,1,B+,CMSC351,"ok as a lecturer, but i give this rating for the TA's and how he ran the class. Ridiculous and unforgiving grading for a class that has simple material. 48 was a C- this semester. ",479
teli,4,A,CMSC351,"Teli isn't a perfect professor, but he genuinely cares about the content he is teaching and about student success. I found his lectures a little boring, but tests and homework felt fair. ",479
teli,4,C+,CMSC351,"The content and class is a mess tbh. But you can tell that Teli cares and wants to make sure that every student gets the idea down. He uses most of lecture time going over the algebra of some analyses, which makes it easy for students to get lost during lecture and find it a pain to sit back down to review everything for the homeworks. 

Before the final, I was sitting around a 56%. After getting a 67% on the final (wasn't as bad as anticipated), I managed to get up to 60%, for a final grade of C+ (3% away from a B-!!) Moral of the story, if I can do it, you can too.",479
teli,4,,CMSC351,"Teli loves to focus on the intuition of algorithms and problem solving. Teli is a patient lecturer and often stops to ask if anyone has questions, and he's quite approachable in office hours. In lectures, he works through the book proofs, and in general the exams don't have too much to do with the homeworks. If you are a math wizard then you might get a little bored, in which case I would suggest Kruskal's class. If you just want to get by, Teli's emphasis on intuition will serve you well.",479
teli,4,B-,CMSC351,"The class really sucks. I really hated it. It’s so focused on trivial algorithms and finding the EXACT runtime complexity that it’s just a math class.
 You don’t really have to worry much about algorithm design, just go on leetcode and see how basic divide and conquer/graph problems are solved and you’ll be able to slide by. Pay close attention to solving recurrences, construction induction, etc. because they’re pretty easy points on exams. 
In my opinion, the hardest part of the tests are trying to understand what the questions are asking, and sometimes the answers to some problems seem nearly impossible to get in the allotted time. Luckily, everyone goes through this struggle together so the final curve is humongous.
Thankfully, Teli is a really good professor. He is so thorough and clear in his lectures, he answers everyones questions, and he really cares about your learning. He will skim over things sometimes, but chances are someone will raise their hand and ask for clarity, to which he’ll happily respond to.
One importing thing though is that he records his lectures BUT not the lectures before tests, which are basically him going through any practice exam he gave us (which are hardly ever representative of an exam we’re given).

TLDR: Teli good, 351 bad.",479
teli,3,B,CMSC351,"He handled the switch to online classes very well and ended up using a fair grading system to adjust to the difficulties of the semester. He goes pretty fast through the material, so I always benefited more from the Panopto recording more than attending his live lecture. Besides for that, there was the usual 351 nonsense: some homework questions were nearly impossible to solve and you couldn't succeed unless you did extra studying on your own time by using outside resources such as Leetcode.",479
teli,2,D+,CMSC351,"Teli gives good lectures (especially online where chat makes it easier to ask questions), but his exams are so brutal and completely different from the homework. And the practice exams. Yeah, the practice exams in this class are worthless. This is a class that needs some major changes, but in its current state, I suppose Teli is a good option.",479
teli,1,,CMSC351,"Had him last year, this review is not just for him but also for his TAs. Had a classmate who tried to get help on HW from a TA named Anton who barely helped and had a very condescending attitude, and at times it felt like all of the TAs were like that. Teli's lectures were simply writing math and proofs over white paper, and they were very dry and sometimes hard to read his handwriting. I wish there could have been additional material like slides. Even if you paid attention it seemed hard to figure detail was actually important and what was not. 

Exams are difficult, and homeworks/practice exams don't really help. What's worse is they are unwilling to provide you with any previous exams whatsoever because they claim it will give the answers away when in reality they could come up with new problems but are too lazy too. Exams felt more like an IQ test where you have to be really clever, and the grading is ruthless. He is extremely stubborn with his rubrics as well; even if both students and TAs feel you have a good argument for partial credit, he's still not gonna give you any points. If I could go back in time I would have taken Kruskal instead because at least his exams are based on his homeworks, unlike Teli and also he seems to be a more effective lecturer who gets his points across and separating them from the non-important points. Only pro I can say is he is nice, but don't make the same mistake I did and think that that means he is an effective teacher.",479
teli,3,,CMSC320,"Not the worst CS professor I have had, but I wasn't impressed. Lectures often delved into hard to follow free-hand mathematical derivations that he would speed through (especially true for the latter half of the class that was focused on ML algorithms). I often felt confused after lectures and bored midway through.  I found understanding in the material through reading lecture slides for some of the topics. Lecture slides for ML algorithms (ie linear regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests, etc) were confusing and I got a way better understanding by watching youtube videos on relevant topics. The midterm was ridiculously difficult which was annoying; the average was pretty low. Projects are interesting in my opinion; I really enjoyed the web scraping project. It was a great introduction to the topic. All projects were written in Python. I can say I gained a lot of worthwhile experience with relevant data science Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and others. I would take this class again but I cannot say I recommend this professor.",479
teli,5,A-,CMSC351,"One of the sweetest professors I've ever had. He will go through any step of an algorithm or analysis if a student is confused, no matter how trivial it is. This is especially helpful when covering topics that require a deeper conceptual understanding like analyzing the complexity of different variations of quicksort. The homeworks are good practice and if you can get your hands on any of the past exam questions, I highly recommend practicing with those as well. The exams can be difficult, but as long as you make sure you get all the easy points scattered throughout and dont get hung up on any one question, you're golden. There was also a heavy curve at the end of the class and Teli even extended the lower bound of the standard deviation to allow more students to get C's and pass (Math: final mean was 70.82 and std. dev was 11.78 so realistically, only grades above a 59.04 should have passed. But he extended it to allow students above a 54 to pass). All in all an incredible teacher and great guy!",479
teli,2,,CMSC351,"Genuinely nice guy and very knowledgable about the material. However, the exams are complete garbage and have nothing to do with anything he teaches or the homework. Alot of the times it feels like he's not even teaching us anything useful. ",479
teli,2,,CMSC351,"This review is based off of the fact that the course is being unfairly graded. The class average is noticeably higher than the past. I have heard from multiple mutual friends that they know other students in large cheating circles, and its likely the cause of the jump in the average. Instructors seem to be unaware of or ignoring this issue, and it is hurting the chances of honest students to pass. Previous semesters had cutoffs in the 40s and 50s, but current students are facing a 64% cutoff. 

This issue could be dealt with by grading this semester slightly different than normal and accounting for grade inflation with a lower cutoff, but it does not seem like they are going to. It is understandable that cheating is difficult to enforce online, but it should not lead to negative repercussions on students performing average under honest efforts. While the semester is not over, it seems like this issue is not going to change. 

I understand some people may read this review and assume I am just taking out my frustration, but I am not. This is a serious problem. I like Teli as a person, and he has better lecturing skills than other professors. This issue stems from the inability to properly proctor exams through Zoom. Adapting your class properly in times like these is important, and Teli just is not. I hope he proves me wrong, but as I said before, the way he is seemingly ignoring this issue is disappointing.

Koppel does a good job of what you need to know for the exams and warns us about what we will need to know for organic chemistry. She comes off a bit sassy at times, but it's important to ask her questions during office hours if you're confused or else you'll fall behind. She does a lot of practice problems during class, which I would pay close attention to because those questions are very similar to the questions on the exams. I recommend doing all the extra practice problems and previous exams that she posts online. The class is curved but only at the end of the semester and it depends on the class average. Overall, if you go to lecture and understand how to do practice problems, you will do fine in the class.",480

koppel,4,A-,CHEM131,"Dr. Koppel was a pretty good professor. She moved very slowly at the beginning, but after we transitioned to online learning she went pretty fast to ""catch up"". In the beginning she did a really good job at explaining the basics, but possibly too much time. After transitioning to online learning, she uploaded multiple lectures at once sporadically to watch at our own pace, which was nice because her lectures are usually fast paced. Her online lectures very good most of the time. It was much harder to learn online personally because discussions and GSS (which are super necessary!!) were not at the usual times and did not feel the same. There is 8 online homework assignments due at the end of the semester which helped me understand concepts and they were not too difficult  Dr. Koppel will tell you that you need to put in the work outside of lecture, which is very very true!! I put in about 3 hours/week in person and probably 6-10 hours/week after the online transition. Organic Chemistry is not as intimidating as it seems if you put in the hard work and Koppel was a pretty good professor.",480
koppel,1,B,CHEM232,Dr. Koppel's lab was a mess! The lab videos were not helpful. You had to go to several office hours to understand how to do the labs.

Thankfully she did a huge curve at the end because she knew everyone failed her final. ,480

koppel,5,A,CHEM231,Fall of 2020 lab wasn’t bad. Took about 6 hrs a week including the lab video you had to watch to “do” the experiment. Must attend office hours (hers and/or the TAs) to do well.

Has clickers but they are for participation instead of accuracy. Also, I did better in the class when I focused on his lectures instead of the textbook. ",481
poulin,5,,CHEM247,"He's a great teacher. Passionate about what he's teaching - he tends to drop random pieces off information about ""interesting"" information related to what we're learning. I'm sure most people in class don't really think that enzymes catalysing keto-enol tautomerization is that interesting but It's really nice watching him get so excited about.
His tends to recycle old questions from past exams so go over those exams- don't just go over the answers go over the questions to and the reaction conditions from the question cause sometimes he be switching them up.
I think after orgo 1, orgo 2 is more mellow cause you're kinda used to the oddity of the whole subject. IF you been through 1 you can definitely work through 2 , just study and practice a lot. I know everyone says practice, practice, practice but its true. Practising will make you more comfortable with the subject.",481
el-sayed,5,A-,,"Best biology professor I have had so far.

He is so nice (bringing in chocolate for no reason), and is extremely intelligent.  His lab on campus is one of the leading in bioinformatics/genomics & he used to work at TIGR, so he definitely knows his stuff.

Dr El-Sayed is funny, charming, understanding, and really wants you to get it.  Going to lectures is a must--the tests are only on slides and any few homework problems he gives you (not worth too many points, but problems on the test are identical).  He says there isn't a curve, but there might be like a 1-2% curve.

The lab for this class sucked, but that's because the T.A. expected us to know computer science and was hard to understand.

The first test is always the hardest, so really pay attention and memorize everything.  The second half of the class isn't so hard.  

There were 2 tests, participation (he makes sure that you go & participate), labs in PLS computer lab(including a lab midterm & final project), and a few random homework problems and two quizzes.

I loved this class and recommend it for anyone interested in bionformatics/genomics/metagenomics, sequencing, etc.  It offers a new and more applicable perspective to the Biology that we learn in all the other classes (also, everything but the lab final project was done in class in team work, so it's not a stressful as a normal bio lab).",482

There were daily classwork assignments at the start of the semester, which were graded pretty harshly, which I found frustrating.

Tests were fair though, and if you got an A on the cumulative final you got an A no matter how you did before, which felt fair to me. ",483

Your TAs are usually sympathetic towards you (you're taking 6 hours of lab a week for this one class, after all) - just make sure you keep up with the lab reports (which are VERY time intensive), attend lecture, and the lecture will basically do the work for you.",484
blough,5,A,CHEM425,"Amazing professor. You dont need the textbook. Just attend lecture and take notes. exams are super straight forward. There's a curve. Our year an 84% was an A. Lab reports are the killer just make sure you see a Ta before submission. Start strong, thats the trick.",484
blough,3,B,CHEM131,"I did not find this class to be that hard. My basic chemistry knowledge from high school helped me out for the first couple of months and then we started going in depth. Blough just reads straight off the powerpoint slides. He is not really helpful as a professor. However, my TA (Chris Simms) was by far the best TA I ever had. Discussion sections are vital! GO TO THEM! It is very hard to depend on Blough when he rehearses the textbook verbatim. Overall, easy class, take good notes, and everything will go well. I even though CHEM 132(lab) was harder than CHEM 131, but thats a different story...",484

All of his powerpoints are straight from the book, and his tests are fairly easy if you just study and practice. Easy class!",484

He went through the slides incredibly fast...you'd be lucky if you could jot down one or two things on the slide.

Honestly, I thought he was awful at teaching, but his exams were fairly easy and he gave ""extra points"" through clicker questions. ",484
blough,5,,CHEM131,"There is nothing particularly good or bad about this professor. His lectures are not very engaging but informative and I found myself getting distracted. However, he posts all his presentations online so the only reason you would want to go to lecture is to get extra credit with the clicker questions which are abundant. The exams are not overly difficult. Just know your stuff and you're good. Just doing the homework is enough to get you through the exams. I'm not crazy about this class but I don't mind it at all and recommend it because it is easy with this professor.

padua-perez,4,B,CMSC131,"Nelson is a great guy! His personality is so nice and he's HILARIOUS in class. He makes it fun to learn and a lot easier to pay attention in class. I am a newbie to computer science so the class itself was a little difficult. Nelson is a good guy for people new to computer science because he will make your introduction to compsci very fun. 
The first midterm for us was really easy and was just like the practice study guide they gave us. The second midterm was ridiculously difficult. It was impossible for anyone with no experience prior to have done well on that exam. Even people that were experienced were depressed after the exam. As for the final, it was a lot better. It wasn't too difficult like the first one but it was still challenging. Make sure to study a lot and go to all the discussions and lectures and to try to learn on your own time because class time is not enough. This class is tailored more for the experienced kids so being a newbie is quite the disadvantage. The whole ""you don't need any experience prior"" was one of the biggest lies I was told. Also be aware of cheating and copying other people's projects or even collaborating. There was a whole thing this year where the professors are going to prosecute those who cheated on projects which will result in an XF (failure and cheating mark) that will stay with you forever even if you retake the class. It's also better to do it on your own because you learn a lot more that way. 
BTW: TA hours are a HUGE mess. It's always packed in the TA office and you have to wait a long time for the TA to even come to you to help you. Kinda why I don't understand why the rules for even talking about the projects together are so strict, but can't really do anything about it. Don't show anyone your code and don't ask anyone for theirs. It's a serious issue.
TIP: Do really well on the projects because those were the only things holding my grade up (as well as the quizzes). You can bomb the exams and still get a decent grade if you do extremely well on quizzes and projects. ",486
padua-perez,1,,CMSC132,"Nelson is absolutely and unequivocally the worst instructor I have ever had the misfortune of taking a class with. He is decent at lecturing most of the time, but that is not too much of a merit, since he just reads off slides. I have asked questions both in class, and in office hours, and I have never received a satisfactory answer. For example, one time in class, he offered an opportunity for us to ask questions about the current project we were working on. When I asked a question, he told me my question was too complicated to understand, and instead of letting me clarify, he instead told me that he wouldn't answer my question, and would be moving on to the next topic. I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.

He uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself. This was quite obvious the other times I had attended his office hours, when he would simply tell me to ask my question to the TAs instead.

As noted in other reviews, he stops lecture to call out students unnecessarily for the most ridiculous things. Aside from it not being funny, it is quite embarrassing to be put on the spot like that.

He is able to still be popular among students because he makes frequent jokes all throughout class. While some of them can be funny, a lot of the jokes I find to be annoying. He jokes about marijuana, cocaine, drinking, etc., in order to project a ""chill"" image which the typical college student will find hysterical.

To summarize this review, Nelson has repeatedly proven he is rude, unable to answer questions that are nuanced, and desperate to be liked. Those genuinely are the three most dangerous traits an instructor can have, as he will find opportunities to belittle you throughout the semester if he knows you don't like him. Stay away from his class at all costs.",486
padua-perez,3,B,CMSC132,"People told me Nelson was awesome before I chose his class, but honestly I'm a little disappointed now. He jokes a lot during the lecture, with makes the class seems easy, but I just feel like I cannot really learn from him. Also I don't like him making fun of students in the lecture. 

I think his exams and quizzes are fair, but the projects are really hard. I personally won't recommend him. In my opinion, he might be a good guy but just an okay professor.",486
padua-perez,5,A,CMSC216,"Nelson is a wonderfully funny professor who really values his students. I would certainly recommend that you take him, if possible, because he makes his classes very enjoyable. His exams can be fairly tricky, but if you study well you will be fine.",486
padua-perez,4,,CMSC216,"In my opinion, Nelson is a solid CS professor. I took 216 with him, and he made it a point to ensure us that it wasn't a weeder course. 

Once you get around the accent, he's great at explaining the topics at hand. He keeps his lectures fairly lighthearted and relaxed, and he also has a sense of humor. He, along with his TAs, are stationed on Piazza to help students with any problems or concerns, and this is very convenient and helpful. 

Projects take longer to complete than those in 131 and 132, and starting early is essential. Quizzes and Exams are fair, and he provides a test bank from previous semesters. The final was challenging, so be prepared. 

Regarding the cons of a class with Nelson - he can be very annoying. The amount of times he will stop the lecture just to call out a student fooling around is just unnecessary and it also distracts everyone in the class. His humor also doesn't appeal to everyone. In addition, be prepared for your inbox to be flooded with his email updates on the course material. I once remember receiving six emails in a 15 minute span from him alone.

The tests are fair too, although he likes to test very nit-picky, minor details that any normal person would just test out in a dummy program rather than memorize.",486
padua-perez,5,A,CMSC216,"I think he is an amazing professor. He is a pretty decent lecturer, but I think what makes him stand out is how receptive he is to student concerns. Every decision he makes is meant to help us succeed and have a better understanding of the material.",486

If enough students were confused about some part of an assignment, he would explain it in detail during lectures, but individualized assistance was hard to find. He never gave any of the pop quizzes he threatened to give, but if he says that something will be on a test or quiz, it will be.",486
padua-perez,3,B,CMSC216,"Nelson's class was very disappointing.  The first half was challenging and interesting.  The second half died for me.  The projects were super simplistic but overly complicated with external obfuscation/unclear specification.  He seemed to claim this was some kind of test of character or professional challenge.  But it just made the last 1/3 of the course into a technically inadequate, stressful game.

He is funny but that's not why I'm in school.  Nor am I in school to be stressed and have my character tested.  There were way too many cheaters, collaborators and brown-nosers who had their strategies for getting their projects done, and they really benefitted in the second half of the course during the b.s. projects.  The students who were doing their own work were then at a disadvantage.  Meanwhile the technical quality of the material covered during that last 1/3 was very low.

i'd rather have a less engaging, entertaining teacher and get a good education throughout the entire class.",486

If computer science is not your thing, this is the best professor you can have. He explains every concept thoroughly and tests you only on what he goes over in class. I'd highly recommend going to class because if you don't, the powerpoint slides will seem really disjointed and incoherent, but in class he explains everything.
Projects are extremely reasonable and are very relevant to what you're doing in class. Quizzes mimic the worksheets he gives out. If you have a problem in the class, USE YOUR RESOURCES (professor, TAs) because they can immensely help.
Makes some funny jokes that lighten the mood of his class, creating a very comfortable environment.

The only complaint is that the end of the semester is pretty rushed in terms of material. He goes over many design patterns, sorting techniques, and algorithm strategies very quickly, and you're expected to have a basic understanding of ALL of them on the final exam. ",486
padua-perez,2,A,CMSC131,"I thought Nelson was a really nice guy, but his lectures weren't really all that good.  He makes the class easy tho, so if all you're worried about is your grade, you'll be fine.  I recommend taking another instructor (Fawzi Emad or Evan Golub) if you really want to learn something.",486
padua-perez,1,,CMSC122,"In all honesty, I don't know why everyone is praising Nelson. Maybe it is because they didn't have him for CMSC122. Seriously, don't take this class. It is just a bunch of unneeded stress. 

Nelson is the first teacher that I've ever had that actually discouraged asking questions. I asked him reasonable questions during lecture and he not only didn't answer them, he makes an example of me in front of the class. 

He also teaches the class as if it is a bunch of grad students or something. He goes super fast and will once in a while ask us if he is going to fast. When I told him he was, he proceeded to go at the same pace.

He is also very inaccessible. He often ignores emails or sends back nasty messages saying things that frankly, I don't understand. The TA's also don't show up to class so when you go into office hours (which also suck) you don't know who they are. 

I went to a lot of the lectures, but I found myself learning more from a friend in a 2 hour period than I did all year with him.

I noticed that computer science is a thing that comes natural to some and not to others. If you are like me and know nothing, seriously reconsider taking this class. ",486
padua-perez,3,A,CMSC122,"He's a good professor and will take every single question you have. His jokes are hilarious the first few days, but then he starts to recycle and it gets old and awkward fast. Which is fine because he really does break down the material into manageable pieces for someone like me who has never done a bit of programming in my life.

There are quizzes but he tells you when they are. He threatens pop-quizzes sometimes because a few weeks in no one listens to him anymore because he moves on to miscellaneous and useless topics after JavaScript, but he never pulled it. 

Make sure to ask him questions in class though because once that clock strikes 1:50 (or whenever the class ends), he is outta there. Won't answer your questions and isn't helpful in office hours. Go to the TA's for that, and that's what he tells you. 

I'm taking this as a programming requirement for my math major so if you need one and want to do minimal work, take this course with Nelson.",486
padua-perez,4,A+,CMSC132,"I took CMSC132 during the summer and I say he's not a bad professor. Lecture material was kind of boring to me as a lot I already knew, but Nelson tried to connect it to real life examples.

The two things I didn't like were that he would make jokes time to time and he would pay too much attention to me. I got 100% on his pop quiz, so I was actually paying attention. I understand why he makes jokes, but I didn't come to class to listen to jokes. I came to learn about OOP. So whenever he did that, I would study something else.",486
padua-perez,3,,,"Nelson was funny, but eventually it got really annoying, and was a waste of time. For a DCC class, this class was a lot of work, considering that most of us don't have programming experience. He's nice and helpful though, so if you enjoy a joker and comedian, Nelson might be the professor for you.",486
padua-perez,1,,CMSC122,"This is by far the worst class at any level of education I have ever taken in my life. The syllabus did not describe the guidelines in the class at all. It just listed that there would be projects at some time during the semester but students were not informed of when projects were due until they were assigned. The professor also assigned a major assignment each week about halfway through the semester. I never had a break from this class. I was always either working on a project or studying for a test or quiz. I understand that there will be assignments, but I never had more work in any class of college so far and I have taken some 400-level classes.

When I had questions about some of the assignments, I would go to both the professor and the TA's office hours. However, once I was there, I received no help. I was told to look over the powerpoint slides again and then turned away. My questions were not answered at all.

The lectures for this class were incredibly boring. The teaching style was horrible. At the beginning of the semester, Nelson said he did not care what students did during his class. Yet throughout the semester, he constantly called out students for talking, texting or typing on their computer. His lecture style was not engaging at all. It was so hard to focus and he did not gear the information at all to people who are not great with computers like myself. Whenever students asked questions, his answers were not helpful at all. 

Worst class ever. Do not take this if you are not great with computers and are not a computer science major.",486
padua-perez,5,B+,CMSC131,"Nelson is a very engaging and fun teacher to have. He enjoys to teach and make jokes at the same time which is very entertaining. Even though he said in the beginning that he will teach like you never did programming before, I believe that is not true. Exams are not that difficult and projects are pretty fair, where as if the class is struggling to finish it, he will extend the deadline. Overall, I would recommend him as a teacher 100%. The TA does not explain the concepts pretty well. ",486
padua-perez,5,A,,"I had Nelson for the first time in a winter course on PHP (cmsc389p). I loved the class. I highly recommend it. Some of the reviews here complained about Nelson's teaching in class, but the problems with these critics are that Nelson teaches such easy topics (CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC122 for non majors, CMSC198 for non majors), and other ridiculously easy classes that he doesn't have to spend all of class lecturing ""int x = 3;"" and basic syntax to you. He's funny, approachable, and will be a great teacher as long as (in his words) ""they pay me enough"". Great guy. Sign up quick, because his classes tend to fill up.",486
padua-perez,5,,,"The first day he had me laughing so hard, i knew it was going to be a good semester. Hes really great at explaining tough concepts, extremely helpful if you go to his office hours, very patient with students who do not understand the material, and very funny. Its rare to have a teacher that can make the class laugh every single lecture. Awesome professor.",486
padua-perez,5,A,,"Great teacher.  He is very straightforward and posts all the powerpoints used in lecture online.  There are also weekly study sheets on the class website that I found helpful for our quizzes and tests.  Nelson also cares about his students, and he is very good at communicating via e-mail and addressing student concerns.  He's also a pretty funny guy, and will tell jokes to make class more interesting.  Just pay attention, because if he sees you using your phone or going on facebook he will call you out on it in front of the whole class!",486
padua-perez,4,A,,"Nelson is an excellent teacher for thsi class if you have programmed before.  Otherwise, the pace of the class might be rather brisk.  Sometimes he does not explain certain material, and asks you to go to his office hours, which apparently he doesn't give a shit about. On the bright side, he is an extremely funny guy, but he has his days, like some days he is 100% business, and other days he is just cracking jokes and you don't learn shit.  He is very understanding in projects, and will give you extra time if you truly need it.  Overall, an extremely friendly guy, but if you get sidetracked, he will pick on you in front of everybody.

My opinion? Take this dude, for whatever class he teaches.",486
padua-perez,1,,CMSC131,Guy says he teaches the class as if none of the students have had programming experience before but that's so false ....... guy sits there and writes code and just gives little explanation. Majority of the class already had programming experience so they understood so the class was clearly catered toward them.  Get Fawzi.,486
padua-perez,4,B,CMSC132,"Nelson is a great teacher. He's very upbeat and likes to tell lots of really geeky jokes during class. He'll know if you're not paying attention and he'll call you out on it, but it's not a big deal. The class is certainly not an easy one. Make sure you have plenty of time to do the projects. Nelson is very accessible and always there to help.",486
padua-perez,4,,CMSC132,"Funny teacher whose ppt lectures are relatively more interesting. Just do not expect him to help you with any personal programming issues. Easy A. Point questions toward TA. Sometimes does not show up to classes for unknown reasons. Does not do anything he doesn't get paid for, I guess. If you have questions just be sure to ask during class so that he will actually give you an answer.",486
padua-perez,5,A,CMSC132H,"Pretty easy class. Projects could get a bit tricky, but tests and quizzes were not a problem at all. Starting the projects early and getting them out of the way is a good idea.

Nelson was encouraging and helpful the few times I have approached him outside of class. As a teacher, he did a pretty good job explaining concepts. No complaints here.",486
padua-perez,1,,CMSC132,"Terrible professor. If you have a backround in programming you will be fine. But if you are taking the class because you are forced to take a programming class and are not a CMSC major and do not spead time programming ""just for fun"" you will be lost. And he is not helpful. Most of my conversations with him were as follows; I dont understand this....
Well, we went over that in class.
Yes I remember, but I didnt understand it in class either. And I still dont understand it.
Well why dont you understand it? I went over it in class.
I know, but I dont understand it.
OVER AND OVER AND OVER",486
padua-perez,5,A+,,"I took CMSC198J over winter term with Nelson and absolutely loved it! He explained concepts very well and gave us a lot of time to practice programming while he was around to help us. This class was an excellent way to finish my Comp-Sci requirement, and the winter term set-up gave us a lot of face time with Nelson. He was very funny and very helpful and appreciated any student who actually made an effort to do the practice programming challenges. Some of the projects took a lot of time, but I found them fun--like solving a puzzle. 
Nelson was an awesome professor and also wrote me a great review for study abroad. If you are a motivated student with a sense of humor, I highly recommend his class. ",486
padua-perez,2,A,CMSC132,"He likes to joke around a lot in class and its pretty funny at first but really gets old and annoying after about the first week. When asked a question in class, he'll most likely respond ""come to my office hours"" or ""go to the TA office hours"". Then when you go to his office hours, he gets irritated and tells you that he already went over it in class. He always emphasizes the fact that he cares about his students and wants to see them successful in class. I really question that...

Best advice I can give you for this class is to start the homeworks and projects early and do take advantage of the TA office hours. They help out a lot. Also he posts practice quizzes and exams which are pretty good study material for the real thing. 

Oh yea, and never go to his office hours asking about a project that is due soon. I went to ask a question about a project three days prior to the due date about a question the TA's couldn't even answer. He spent 10 minutes lecturing me about how ""successful programmers"" start projects early so that they aren't cramming to do it at the end. Then he told me to go to TA office hours...

Overall not a hard class but don't expect too much out of Nelson. ",486
padua-perez,2,,CMSC132,"the only reason im giving nelson any stars at all is because he explains concepts pretty well during class. other than that, if you have to take 132 this semester, take it with fawzi. nelson wastes A LOT of time saying jokes that have NOTHING to do with class. he may seem funny at first, but when you really need help and he doesn't answer your question, it's not funny anymore. when people ask him questions, he either says ""ask the TA"", ""we already went over that"", or ""come to my office hours"". ive gone to his office hours and he just sends me back to the TAs. he also is not considerate of our time. he gave a project AND homework at the same time (homeworks are like mini projects). i also agree with the person below me about EVERYTHING they mentioned.",486
padua-perez,2,,CMSC132,"i lot of people liked him. but to me he was very annoying and got on my nerves.  he tries too hard to be funny, and most of the time isn't funny at all.  he also says he does not care if u don't pay attention in class as long as you don't disrupt the class.  but he himself disrupts the class every 5 min to yell/joke at some kid for not paying attention when the student wasn't even disrupting the class",486
padua-perez,5,A,,"This is probably the hardest I have ever worked for an ""elective"" course, but I really did enjoy the class. It says it is for beginners but Nelson covers a lot of difficult material. I had background in some web programming so I did alright, but the people without any experience seemed to struggle. I would take it over again just for him, he's worth coming to class! If nothing else, even if I was so behind I wanted to cry, Nelson made class interesting and fun.",486

Some days he is on the money with his comedy show, but some days I really felt like telling him to stfu.

The only other complaint was that he rushed the end of the semester pretty hard, so make sure you stay on top of the material. During the last week he made us memorize details for dozens of design patterns which were all on the final.",486

Other than that, I learned a lot and had a bit of fun, too. Got an A in his class.",486

The projects are difficult but they can be rewarding.",486
padua-perez,2,,CMSC131,"Good personality with a great sense of humor but that’s about it. Complaints: 
+ His project descriptions do not flow well at all. They often have grammatical errors and information seems to be scattered all over the place, making projects very intimidating for beginners. Explanations do not make much sense at all unless you’re proficient with programming. Instructions for projects are simply horrible to say the least. Either too much info scattered throughout or too little. You’ll spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly it is you have to do, unless you’re already good at coding. 
+ His lectures are all over the place. Every minute, he interrupts himself to tell someone to stop talking (even if they weren’t talking). For us beginners, it doesn’t help that he keeps doing that. He should just focus on his presentation and teach us the lectures without interruption. 
If you’re good at coding, take his class. He’s funny and makes class fun. But if you’re new to coding, be careful. His projects will give you constant headaches, and you’ll waste a ton of time trying to make sense of the project briefings. ",486
padua-perez,1,,,"His project descriptions are full of grammatically errors and make absolutely no sense at all. 

Every single minute of his lectures, he interrupts himself to tell someone to stop talking even if they aren’t talking. This makes it difficult for us beginners to focus on what he’s saying since he keeps on interrupting himself mid sentence. 
If you’re good at coding, sure, take his class. He’s funny and makes a ton of jokes. 
But if you’re a beginner, beware. His inability to teach the content in an easy-to-understand way, coupled with his convoluted project descriptions, will give you headaches and nightmares. ",486

CMSC389N was an alright elective. Midterms were easy as hell and the final probably will be too, but there's a ton of written code required. We had a group project where we had to use php/html, javascript, and bootstrap and that was actually pretty neat and a good group learning experience.

This is a great class for anyone looking to get into php/javascript and web app platforms, or databases. I ended up despising web dev this semester, but it was a good experience to learn some php/html, JS/JQuery, and SQL in case I have to use it in the future... plus Nelson is a laugh, haha. Good luck!",486

padua-perez,5,A,CMSC389N,"Currently in his 389N class now but this is my third straight spring semester with him as a teacher. Had him two years ago in 132, and last year in 216. So this review will cover all those classes.

132: First time having a class with him and my god he was crazy funny and just all around cool. People don't like him because of his jokes but he does that because he believes that students can only focus for a short period of time and need to take a small break before focusing on the lecture again. I find this VERY effective! He is a really effective teacher. I got a C in 131, barely survived, and when I took Nelson for 132, I had a whole new understanding of the material that was way more invaluable from studying java the previous semester. First time taking his exams at this time as well and he basically makes his real ones the same flavor as the practice exams (because they're all old exams). Naturally he makes the final harder and a little more different but it can be done. 132 was my favorite semester at UMD and nelson was a HUGE part of it. Made me happy to be a CS Major.

216: Ok so i had to retake after fucking it up the semester before with Herman. Most of what I said about 132 can be repeated here as well. Old exams follow the same style as the ones he gives you. The projects, yes are daunting and make you stress a little bit but with a little tenacity it can be done. he made 216 a lot easier for me after Herman ruined it for me. 

389N: It's my most favorite class of the semester. Despite the time its taught in the mornings any class with Nelson is a blast and this class is his ""child"" so to speak. It's web dev which is right up my alley and his passion as well. The first exam was really really (and i mean really) easy. And the projects i can finish in a matter of 2-3 days depending on how much time i spend on them. Unless Nelson offers more classes or teaches more in the upper levels this will most likely be my last semester with him as a teacher :( It was well worth it all three times. He makes you proud to be a CS major.",486
padua-perez,5,A+,CMSC389N,"He's a very funny professor who actually provides a good CS course. His projects are very reasonable, and he even gives code example to help with the projects. Tests are very easy, you just have to practice his old exams that he provides. I never got lower than a B- taking 3 of his classes. CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC389N.",486
padua-perez,4,A-,CMSC389N,"This guy is basically your favorite high school teacher as a UMD professor.

Really, really good dude.  If you ever have any problems while you're taking his class, you can go to his office hours and talk to him about it and he will do his best to work through those issues with you.  He seriously, legitimately, actually cares about his students, which is something you don't see very often.

As much as I'm tempted to give him a 5 star review, I can't just because he's not a great lecturer.  He's funny in class, but he gets a little off-topic and distracted a lot, so a lot of what you learn from him, you have to learn from his slides outside of class.  He makes this super easy though, because his slides are great and he records all his lectures on panopto, so you can go back over things if you missed something.

All in all, he's one of my favorite professors I've had here and if you get a chance to take a class with him, do it.  You won't be disappointed as long as you actually take the time to talk to him and get to know him.",486

He gets distracted very easily and will look to call anyone out that is talking to their neighbor or on their phone, even if they are not bothering anyone. This ends up being a distraction to the entire class and I find it hard to focus or take him seriously. 
He posts lecture slides that are very helpful and they reflect the content that  will be on the exams. He is a fair teacher but I do not enjoy going to lecture. ",486
padua-perez,5,A-,CMSC131,"My only prior experience to CS was Programming 1 my senior year of HS, and all those topics were covered within the first two weeks of CMSC131 so everything was fairly new. 

Nelson is an incredible professor! He makes the lecturers funny and engages with his students. He really cares for his students and extends projects when he sees fit. Sometimes there are 1 point assignments to boost your grade a little. His lectures are posted online but I highly recommend going to class and then going home to rewatch the lecture and taking notes. I did this for the final exam and scored really high that I wished I did this throughout the semester so that I wouldn't have been crying about the projects. Projects are hard but people are willing to help!! His exams and quizzes are no surprise if you studied and dedicate time for the materials.

Open to help on Piazza and usually assigns enough time for projects, but you will most likely be directed to a TA for help. He gives lots of time to complete quizzes.",486
padua-perez,5,C,CMSC131,"Nelson does a great job of making a potentially boring class, extremely fun. He explains the concepts well and adds in humor to make it bearable. This class is a lot of work, of course, but here are a lot of ways to get help if you need it. I am going to take his classes as many times as I possibly can.",486
padua-perez,4,C+,CMSC132,"Nelson is a kind professor who will help you navigate your programming career and learning how to learn. He is decent at teaching and makes the class enjoyable. Do not be fooled by his jokes, if this is the first time that you are learning JAVA, be prepared to work hard in this class, the kids who took JAVA is high school will make it harder for you to get a good grade. I would take Nelson over Yoon for sure. Overall, if you can't get Fawzi(hard exams) then you will be ok with Nelson (he is big on giving your old exams and other resources).",486
laronde,5,B+,BCHM461,"I made a typo in my previous review. Here's an updated version. 

+ Really nice, even in office hours 
+ HW & clickers are grade boosters, you only need to meet a certain threshold to get full credit 
+ 1 of our 3 midterms was take-home 
+ We get a notecard for exams and she even gave us the notecard  in class 
+ Puts ""things to know"" on the end of her lecture slides which serves as a study guide 
+ Posts powerpoints & old exams  

*Sit in the front b/c it's hard to hear in the back 
*This class is taught slightly differently depending on the prof. I think she incorporated more bio than gen chem, but this could be a pro if you like bio better. 
*We had this awful group protein project, but it's because another professor is obsessed with 3D printing. The project was being piloted the semester I took 461, so it might be easier for you all.  

Biochem is a traditionally hard subject, but Dr. LaRonde makes it possible to do well.",489
laronde,2,B,BCHM461,"I don't know what to say about laronde. Her teaching is not very good, her exams are meh, and her final was completely odd. I did fine in her class, but I came out feeling like I knew less than I started with. 50% of the class was asleep or on their phones during her lectures. If you are good at learning on your own, take laronde, cause her tests are easy. But if you need a lecturer or want to actually learn something, take someone else.",489
ramachandran,5,B+,MATH461,"Ramachandran is the only teacher that I have felt the need to sign up and review. He is incredibly knowledgeable and extremely approachable. For those of you who wish to learn and want a teacher you can talk to, take his class. If you are the type who just wants a minimum work A look elsewhere. This teacher will make you a better student, this is a teacher where your tuition is worth it.",493
ramachandran,5,A,MATH406,"Dr. Ramachandran is, hands down, the best college professor I've ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable, is very good at communicating information and is a very nice man who essentially embodies everything that is needed in a college professor.

Let me begin by admitting that his class was very challenging. The homeworks were tough, the average on the two midterms probably averaged out at a 59 (there was a very generous curve at the end of the course) and you won't get very far by lollygagging and mindlessly memorizing a few formulas. That being said, I thoroughly learned about an immense (almost unbelievable) amount of difficult and very important mathematical concepts and I am very, very happy that I took the course with him. After having taken Rama's course I honestly consider myself a much more mature and knowledgeable mathematician than I did before I took his course (and I had straight As in math beforehand). 

I guess I should also warn you that Ramachandran is not for everyone. A lot of people in my class didn't like it at all and claimed that he was a bad professor for various lame reasons. Usually, their reasoning was something like, ""He's all over the place and is impossible to follow,"" or, ""I feel like we don't learn anything in the class"". What that illustrates is that they're not accustomed to rigorous, difficult math courses and that they're either too lazy or not apt enough to study and understand the deeper concepts that are actually worth putting the time and effort in for. One kid in the class said that ""Modular arithmetic is dumb because there are no formulas."" If you associate yourself with people like that then I recommend dropping out of any upper-level math courses and taking something more your style like communications.

In summation, I highly recommend Dr. Ramachandran to anyone who is a serious and mature student and/or to anyone who wants to learn some awesome math. If you're in it for the easy A then take he class with someone else.


P.S. His grading is very fair; it's just that his problems and homeworks are challenging and take a fair amount of time and effort to complete.",493
ramachandran,5,,MATH340,"This review is for both 340 and 341 since I had him for both classes.

Ramachandran teaches well and you can learn a lot, but only if you put in the effort. I agree with Anonymous below; Ramachandran teaches a lot of material in a short amount of time. To get the most out of the class, try to read the book beforehand. Even if you don't completely understand what you're reading, you'll still be better prepared when you get to class as the material won't be completely new to you.

What sets him apart from the other professors I've had is that he is really enthusiastic about math and teaching. Anyone who has taken him will agree; he will literally smile the entire lecture, even as he talks. It was great because his enthusiasm made me enthusiastic about math and learning the material. Coming into college, I didn't know what I wanted to do (I was considering like ten different majors), but taking this class (and 341) made me realize that I really want to do math in my future.",493
ramachandran,4,,MATH340,"Ramachandran knows a lot and tries to teach all of it.  If you can write detailed notes quickly and are fine with rereading them later to figure out the hard parts, you can learn an incredible amount.  Unfortunately, he teaches so much material so fast that if you try to follow his train of thought exactly and figure out exactly what all of the logical leaps are, you may get lost.  He is a quality professor, but you have to do a lot of work to get the most out his class.",493
ramachandran,4,B,MATH340,"Ramachandran does not deserve a 2 star rating. I wouldn't give him a perfect 5, but I simply cannot classify him as a bad professor. I am not a math major; physics, but not math, and I had him for a more rigorous course: math340, as a freshman. The biggest thing about Ramachandran is that he cares about his students and cares about their understanding of the material. He will help you if you ask for it and he will make it a personal endeavor to ensure you understand. Tests were very fair and the class was justly curved. He is a good guy and a high quality professor. Enough said.",493
ramachandran,2,A,,"Horrible professor! Although he seems as if he may actually know his stuff, he is incapable of sharing his knowledge with the class. Lectures are all over the place making it seem like you've accomplished nothing by the end of class. Grading is completely disorganized and possibly unfair. You can go an entire semester without having any idea what your grade is or what he expects from you. He has a hard time getting people interested in the class and seems to doubt his own performance, as well. ",493
ramachandran,5,B+,MATH340,"I found Dr. Ramachandran's MATH340 to be extremely difficult but extremely rewarding. Be prepared to spend 6+ hrs on homework working in groups. Tests have bonus questions, and scores ranged from <50% to >110%. It's probably best if you have at least 1 of the following as background: (1) MVC (2) LinAlg (3) writing proofs.",493
ramachandran,5,A-,MATH340,"Dr. Ramachandran is awesome - knowledgeable, solid lecturer, and overall a very nice person. He legitimately cares about his students and always goes the extra mile. He is very generous with his time in office hours and even had review sessions on Saturdays before the final. MATH340 is not an easy class, but with Dr. Ramachandran, you will definitely get a solid exposure to the theoretical material. Understanding, though, is pretty dependent on YOU putting in effort. If you want to take MATH340 and are willing to work hard, you will like him.",493
ramachandran,5,A-,MATH340,A great professor by every regard. A challenging but rewarding course and professor to take. Effort shown during class and through assignments and homework is awarded with generous extra credit to compensate for the challenging but not unfair exams.,493
ramachandran,5,A,MATH340,"I took Math 340 with Ramachandran in the Fall 2016 semester. Now, being a junior, I can confidently say that Ramachandran remains the best instructor I have ever had in any academic environment. He is incredibly knowledgeable about mathematics, and it shows during his lectures. He is also incredibly passionate both about the math and about teaching to the students - every time we would be getting into some ""nitty-gritty"" stuff in lecture he would have a huge smile on his face because you could tell how much he loved what he was doing. This love is infectious and keeps you very engaged during lectures.

With that being said, Ramachandran wants his students to know some difficult math. He will introduce some very difficult concepts , and you will have to put in time to keep up with the material. He is very fair about this, however - for instance, we discussed the generalized Stoke's Theorem at the end of the course, but were never asked to prove anything too intense using this result on a test.

Overall, I would 100% recommend taking Ramachandran at any chance you get. You will learn a great deal.",493
ramachandran,5,A,MATH340,"Ramachandran is a great professor. 340 is by no means an easy class to take freshman year, but he makes everything seem doable. Motivation of the theory and development of both linear algebra and multivariable calculus is done wonderfully, using several examples. It was unfortunate that we had to rush towards the end, but there is a lot of content in this course that needs to be chewed on.

Besides course content, he is perfectly happy to talk to students after class in order to answer questions.
The grading TA by year varies and you should quickly find out their expectations regarding homework.",493
ramachandran,5,A,MATH340,"Professor Ramachandran is the best professor I have ever had and I would guess that I probably ever will have. 

MATH340 was really hard, but it was a ton of fun. I came into the class without knowing any calc 3 or linear algebra, so I was already behind, but Ramachandran is very good at starting at a basic level before he begins abstracting to the really difficult concepts throughout the course. His homework was killer, and the TA was pretty harsh with grading, but working in groups to finish the homework makes it feasible to score really well and understand everything that's being taught. He's a fantastic lecturer, and his enthusiasm for teaching math made me love coming to his lectures. He's also very generous with curving the course. Anyone who works hard and has a drive to learn math should be able to get a passing grade in this class. 

Overall, I'm very thankful to have had Professor Ramachandran this semester, and I'm really looking forward to taking MATH341 with him next semester. 


",493
ramachandran,5,A,MATH340,"MATH340 was a really tough class, especially for someone without much prior exposure to Linear Algebra, Calc 3, and abstract math. Professor Ramachadran's attitude towards the class, however, was infectious: he tackled every topic with enthusiasm and a smile on his face, explaining the content in a way that most of the class could understand on his first go-around. And for those who still didn't get it, like me, Professor Ramachadran was happy to go over content during office hours, and schedule extra office hours when necessary. Of course, this was still with that infectious smile.
The homeworks in this class were brutal, but Professor Ramachadran was happy to help with any issue with them, and my proof-writing abilities improved as a result. Same goes for test prep, where the professor made sure that we had adequate resources and understood the material if we approached him. Importantly, he recognized my limited background in the subject, and explained material to me with that in mind.
Overall, this class was still extremely difficult. But I wouldn't recommend one to take it with anyone other than Professor Ramachadran, especially if you have limited background.",493
rabin,3,B,ENMA301,"His teaching was decent and his tests were challenging but (barely) reasonable, but his TAs graded the homework really harshly (75 average for the homeworks) and he was rude and disrespectful, both during class and in person. Plus in an email to the entire class discussing the paper we wrote he said, ""The other common problem was that the opening paragraph of the paper was truly poorly written (to the extent of inspiring suicidal thoughts).""
Make of that what you will. ",495
rabin,4,A,ENMA300,"Dr. Rabin is a very friendly, soft-spoken individual who cares about students learning the material well. He's not the most exciting lecturer in the world, but he does a good job of covering the most important topics and spending time to explain certain concepts that are more involved.

I found Dr. Rabin to be responsive to e-mails, and he tried hard to make time to see students outside of class. Seeing him in his office was nice, because although it is painfully obvious how intelligent he is, he does not come off as condescending whatsoever. There isn't a lot to say because 300 isn't a super intense class, but I'm glad to have Rabin for 301 next semester.

Edit for students figuring out when to take 301: Workload varies a bit throughout the semester, but I'd figure an average of about five hours per week. There is a three page (single spaced) paper due before the final exam that can be time consuming. Exams were harder than in 300; despite the class being all materials students, averages were slightly lower (65-75%).

The actual content is focused more on applications, which is refreshing. Also, I don't know if Rabin was trying to be mean this semester, but he was very misleading when it came to informing the class about the midterms. ""Midterm two will focus mainly on the biomaterial journal articles."" Everyone pores through long, complex journal articles. Midterm two has no questions concerning the biomaterial journal articles. ""Yes, you will get a formula sheet for midterm three."" Midterm three has no formula sheet, and primarily tests knowledge of new formulas. Seriously balls.",495
rabin,2,B,ENMA300,"He is an interesting teacher to say the least. Generally about half of the class is asleep during his power point lectures. He really knows his stuff but has trouble teaching it to his students. Not a terrible class, but not a fun class either.",495
rabin,4,B,ENMA300,"Smart guy, good teacher, boring lecturer.  Based on other students complaining about their ENMA300 professor, I would suggest taking this guy for intro to materials as he is not a bad teacher at all.",495
rabin,3,B,,"I took this course with a bunch of grad students and undergrads and he gives the same tests to both groups. The class itself was really interesting, an Rabin did a decent job of teaching it but he would never give you a clear idea of what your grade was throughout the class. Sometimes he would just give you a letter grade, and other times it would be a number. It also seems as though he graded both the undergrads and grads at the same level. He was approachable though and made time to help students, but at time when you had a question via email, he just wouldnt respond if he didnt feel like it. Overall class is interesting but he isnt the best of teachers.",495
rabin,3,B,ENMA300,"I expect to hear about Dr. Rabin in the news one day as a recipient of the Nobel Prize.  Man is way smart, but can't teach.  Very nice and approachable, and the class was really interesting, but a struggle since it was difficult for him to teach it to us.",495
brosnan,3,B-,MATH141,"Easy exams, but doesn't teach",496
brosnan,5,A,MATH403,"An awesome professor. Although MATH403 is a hard class, Patrick made the content enjoyable and easy to understand. He is super helpful during office hours and is looking out for his students. ",496
brosnan,5,A,MATH403,"Super chilled prof, thinking of him makes me giggle. I learned so much from him! What's really cool about his teaching style is that he's pretty personal about the stuffs he teaches, so the emphasis on the material is heavily flavored with an algebraist's perspective. The whole class was keen and fun and backed by solid motivations. Wish we had a longer semester to cover more.

If you're taking classes with him, please take good care of him. Go to class and envision his brilliancy.",496
brosnan,4,A-,MATH141,"I enjoyed his class. His exams were far easier than the other professors. He is not the best teacher but definitely worth taking him for those easy exams.  He also drops 1 midterm, 2 quizzes, and like 4 homeworks... (Fall '19)",496
brosnan,4,B+,MATH141,"Makes Calc 2 doable. He drops a midterm, like half of the quizzes, and 5 or 6 homeworks. Lectures are a bit proof-heavy, but the midterms are easier than some other professors'. Final is rough, but he does curve.",496
brosnan,2,D-,MATH141,"My failing grade is mostly due to me being a bad student and going through a rough patch but I also have stuff to say about his class.
He's a pretty okay person and his tests were decently easy but he just goes on and on about proofs when we could be doing examples and actually learning how to solve the problems. So I guess take his class if proofs help you.
Also I felt severely under prepared for the final and bombed it. I went from a C+ to a D-.",496
brosnan,4,A-,MATH405,"He's a really nice guy, but he has this really annoying habit of deciding he's ""bored"" halfway through a proof during lectures. Harsh grading in exams but curves at the end of the semester. I would recommend him overall for 405 since he's an algebraist so he has a lot of interesting things to say about the subject.",496
brosnan,2,B-,MATH141,His exams throughout the semester are not difficult at all. But that’s the only thing he has going for him. His lectures are really confusing and he does not prepare you for the final exam which determines way too much of your grade. I had an A before the exam and ended up with a B-.,496
brosnan,4,,MATH403,Brosnan managed to switch to an online format with little to no hassle and he cares a lot about his students and their performance. The notes were quite organized and easy to follow as well. The only reason he's 4 stars out of 5 is because he does this thing where he goes through a proof and in some parts says the result is obvious when the jump to a conclusion is not so clear. ,496
paukstelis,4,,BCHM461,"This is an intense class with a lot of material. While some concepts can simply be memorized, you will need to be able to connect concepts together to do well on the exams. Two lecture videos were uploaded weekly. I found the lectures hard to get through in one sitting, but they provided most of the material needed to do well on the exams. I definitely recommend using office hours and discussion to ask questions. Dr. Paukstelis and the TAs were both very nice and approachable. ",497
sadeghian,3,A,CMSC132,"What you would expect from a professor. He goes through the material relatively well, but fails to engage the class in any way. I was fortunate enough to have Nelson post his lectures for the class so I don't go to lectures anymore, but overall I feel the class is still manageable by just reading the power point slides posted online. 
CMSC132, in general:
Quizzes can be annoying I recommend taking them seriously because they can really impact your grade if you don't do well.
Projects: Projects were relatively easy I would just give yourself enough time to do them.
Midterms: Overall, were generally fair but have very nitpicky questions in some cases, doing the practice midterms that are posted is more than sufficient study material. ",500
sadeghian,4,B,CMSC132,Pedram is really good at balancing teaching concepts and explains the actual code that goes into the course. The only caveat I’d say about pedram is his discussion sections aren’t always relevant.,500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC131,"Class wasn't too boring for an intro course. He tried his best to teach to the lowest common denominator, since it is an intro course. Grading is fair, didn't always know everything in lecture but he tried his best to answer what he could. ",500
sadeghian,5,A,CMSC132,"A good professor overall with answers to all your questions and willing to admit if he doesn't know the answer off the top of his head. Entertained every question a student threw at him, even if he had to defer to later in the class to answer it. Many felt his midterms were extremely difficult, but they're fair tests of your knowledge in the class. They're challenging, but they're not impossible if you study all the content and can write the code. For all the exams, Pedram said what the coding section would be on (of course not the specific question but the general topic) to make sure you knew going in. ",500
sadeghian,1,,CMSC132,"No Piazza forum to ask questions only TA hours. When I asked the TA why he doesn't set up a piazza forum, he quoted Pedram and said ""I'm too lazy."" Average on the midterms were about a ~60%. Pedram has a very monotone voice and as a result is very boring. Projects were alright, start early and you should be straight. Going to TA hours on the day a project is due is like waiting in line at a yeezy shoe release. I wouldn't take him if I were you. ",500
sadeghian,2,B,CMSC132,"He knows his stuff but does not know how to test on knowledge. Midterm averages were pretty low, and about 15-20% of the class had to drop the class just because of those. He's definitely a nice guy, but the TAs weren't great, and the lack of TA office hours will leave you scrambling if you need help on a project. ",500
sadeghian,4,A-,CMSC132,"Pedram is an excellent lecturer. Class is super well structured, and he considers when it might be more effective to show you example code, then slides, or the slides and then the example code. In general, though Nelson is the one posting Piazza updates, he is simply there in lecture, teaching like he always does.

I've heard when he is not co-teaching with someone like Nelson, his exams are very difficult, so take that into consideration. He is also very boring. A good majority of my section stopped showing up to either lecture or discussion because of this.",500
sadeghian,5,A,CMSC216,"I had Pedram for 216 and for 132. I think Pedram is a great lecturer and does a good job of explaining concepts. He tries to spend most of his time going over live coding examples as opposed to just reading off of the slides. For 216, Pedram co-taught with Herman so we had Herman's exams and projects. If Pedram is co-teaching definintely take him. However, if Pedram is not co-teaching like he was for my 132 class, his exams are definitely way more difficult, but not impossible. I recommend him!",500
sadeghian,3,A,CMSC216,"Very boring. Does not engage the class very well. His voice has a habit of putting half the class to sleep and his lectures do not keep your attention. He goes over concepts pretty well, and his diagrams/drawings in class are helpful at times. When he makes his own exams, he is very pedantic about specific concepts, which is guaranteed to trip up most  students, including those who have a strong grasp of computer science.",500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC132,"Great, effective lecturer. He can be boring, but I think that can be overlooked when considering how well he can explain the concepts taught. However, I took this class when Nelson was co-teaching. I'm not sure how well he fares on his own",500

sadeghian,5,A+,CMSC132,"Great lecturer, gave reasonable workload and challenging but rewarding and thought-provoking tests and projects.  Only small thing is that he didn't exactly go out of his way to show himself on camera or talk to students directly, but overall I can't blame him during a pandemic.  Never felt like his work was busy work and always gave us access to the slides and notes we needed.",500
sadeghian,4,,CMSC132,"Lecturing skills were overall okay. The format, however, was just going over what's next in the course until 50m is up. It felt a bit unorganized and the class felt dry as a whole.",500
sadeghian,4,A,CMSC132,"Pedram's lectures are super boring and monotone, but he is a good professor who explains his concepts very clearly. Watching his lectures on a faster speed is essential. CMSC132 was organized super well online (lectures, slides, and code examples always uploaded), although discussions often felt like a mixed bag because we would often just go over random Java topics that we weren't tested on. Around halfway through the semester, the difficulty of the projects and quizzes/tests (especially quizzes/tests) did spike a lot. You did have 8 hours for every quizz/test, though which was very generous. The first half of the course is pretty laidback 131 review.",500
sadeghian,2,B,CMSC132,Extremely difficult exams. ,500
sadeghian,4,B+,CMSC122,"His lectures are fine, but can be unbearably slow and monotone. Tests and quizzes were OK as long as you kept up with your lectures. He didn't really interact with students much, but the class was fully online so I can't say that I expected anything different. ",500

Pros:
+ Competent and informative lecturer. A lot of people say he's boring, but I honestly disagree, he makes extensive use of example code to ensure students understand what's going on.
+ Projects are good applications of what you are learning.
+ Tests are fair.",500
sadeghian,4,A,CMSC132,Had him for online semester. The lectures were pretty slow but he definitely knew what he was talking about. The exams were a bit tougher than usual but I do feel that they were fair. ,500
sadeghian,1,,CMSC132,"His exams are extremely difficult and take nearly 8 hours to complete. Although he may brush over exam concepts in lecture, he doesn’t provide any examples of how to actually use the concepts. If you do not have programming experience before college, good luck. ",500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC122,Lectures are on the boring side but the course was run will completely remote. The exams were mental difficulty because they were take home. The three midterms were supposed to take 1 hour but they took me 3-5 hours.,500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC132,"Exams were extremely hard, had to spend almost the entire day on them. He was a fine lecturer considering the asynchronous nature of the class.  ",500
sadeghian,2,,,"I don't know why everyone keeps giving him 4+ stars even though the consensus is that his exams are really hard? Unless you're a super coder (coded before) or this is your only hard class,  don't take this guy. His lectures a dry, his midterms are BRUTAL and he barely curves. Especially for online, he makes the exams 10x harder than previous years, which would be fine if he curved each exam or curved the class more than like 1%, which he doesn't",500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC132,"He sounds like Ben Shapiro if you put his lectures on 1.5x speed but he is very hands off with the online format. You will pretty much only talk to the TAs and there is no live interaction at all with Pedram. His exams weren't that hard imo, but the projects were difficult not because they were hard to implement but because it was difficult to understand what needed to be implemented from the instructions. I've had bettter CS teachers and I've had worse. Decent.",500
sadeghian,4,A+,CMSC132,"Took this class Fall 2020. Pedram is a good lecturer. He might be a little boring, but he runs through plenty of examples and is very clear. The online exams are very fair, not very difficult but a little time-consuming. Start on them early and you can definitely finish in the allotted time. ",500
keleher,3,B,CMSC424,"A lot of people say he's a douche or a jackass or w/e, so I was a bit worried when the class first started.  In my opinion there's nothing to worry about. Yes, there are times when he gets a little impatient with people, but to me it didn't seem any more extreme than any other professor. His responses on piazza were always curt, but I feel like most professors give super short/curt responses that could be seen as rude when it comes to written communication. 

As far as teaching style, he's your average CS prof. Go to class, he pulls up slides and goes through them. He seemed to actually care whether or not students were understanding the material as he would stop and check often if people were keeping up. He would also encourage people  fairly often to ask questions. 

In my case, it seemed like any of the few signs there may have been of him not enjoying teaching the class stemmed from the lack of class participation when he would encourage it (which was often) so he would be left talking at us, or there would be a dialogue between only him and a couple students. ",501
keleher,3,,CMSC414,"Summary: Very average professor.

Lecture:
Mostly off of power-points which he posts online. Going to class is optional, but questions on the quizzes will sometimes come from things he says during class that are not on the power-points. The actual material was usually very interesting, but there was so much material to cover most of the time we just brushed over topics without really learning how they worked. Taking CMSC456 before this class will give you a slight advantage (very slight).

Quizzes:
There were 3 quizzes which were pretty hard. They are all short answer or diagram drawing. I felt the quizzes would emphasize a random subset of the material covered, so if you are weak on a certain topic and it shows up on the exam you are screwed. On the other hand it could not show up at all and you get lucky.

Projects:
The projects were actually pretty fun as we got to carry out things like buffer overflows, dictionary attacks, and XSS attacks. They also more or less got easier as the semester went on. Languages used were C, Java, and Javascript. He provides resources and examples if you don't know Javascript, I taught myself everything I needed to know for the Javascript coding in less than an hour.

Final:
It was a little harder than the quizzes I thought. But it is only worth 12% of your grade, which was a weird concept as I am used to it being between 30% and 40%.

Grading:
5 projects 11% each
3 quizzes 11% each
1 final worth 12%

Overall the material was interesting, but it seemed crammed. I think this would be a good first 400 level course as it gives you a nice overview so you can think about concentrations you would like to focus on in future courses. ",501
keleher,3,,CMSC216,"Teaches reasonably on the current subjects but makes quizzes ridiculously difficult. Instead of putting the topics we've covered and practiced on the quizzes, he not only puts the most recent material but also the most abstract and picky questions.
Projects were very difficult like any other teacher in 216.
Very full of himself and difficult to approach. If you read all of the readings yourself and start the projects early, it's a manageable class.",501
keleher,3,A+,,"Keleher is a knowledgeable professor, but does not seem enthusiastic about teaching students. He reads off slides and sometimes adds in comments.

Not the most exciting teacher, and tough, but he gives plenty of practice exams. Sometimes these practice problems are even the actual problems on the exam.",501
keleher,3,C,,"He's an okay teacher. He's kind of your typical cs jackass, i asked for help on one project and he told me that it wasn't that difficult and he could do it in 25 minutes. If you bug him for help, he'll help you, just be prepared to feel like an idiot. His lecture slides aren't bad, and if you go to class you should be fine. But be prepared to work a lot. ",501
keleher,3,A,,"He is an adequate professor. at times it seems that he doesn't try very much with the class though, taking most of the material that he is using to teach directly from the material prepared for the previous semester. It's nice however, that he skips over the specifics that you can look up on you own in order to cover more material.",501
keleher,1,A,CMSC818E,"He's the most irresponsible professor I have ever seen. Honestly he puts on a project with little specification and ends up changing it over and over for the next week. The deadline is not extended of course so if you started working then sorry you wasted your time.

Also he doesn't even know the papers he is making you read so if you have any question then too bad; you won't get an answer.

Course was a waste of time I learned nothing.",501
keleher,4,A,CMSC424,"This is a good class overall, especially in an online setting. The content is definitely relevant and need-to-know, and Keleher is a good and straightforward lecturer - doesn't meander or BS around at all. Some might consider him too curt but I honestly prefer that to a professor that's distracting or all over the place. 
Slides are good, although I wish he could post slides before lecture and also record them, but that's mainly to give us incentive to show up to class. 
Projects aren't too bad, we have a week to do each and each are worth a good chunk of the grade. Speaking of which, I'm glad that the grade distribution for this class is balanced, so that no one assignment / exam is worth an insane amount (looking at you 351). Exams and quizzes are also fair. 
Overall, I'd recommend taking this class with Pete if you can. ",501
keleher,2,A-,CMSC424,Mediocre prof. Reads of the PowerPoint rather than teaching. Posts quizzes and makes them due before he actually teaches the material. Refuses to post lecture recordings. Projects aren't bad. Very vague on information relating to exams. Pushes students to participate.,501
keleher,3,P,CMSC424,"Other than this class being useless, Peter is an awful teacher.  He doesn't record lectures, reads off of slides, and seems to have no passion for teaching the material.  Avoid if you can.",501
keleher,2,P,CMSC424,"Not a great experience. I took the course while it was online and it was harder for unnecessary reasons. Keleher refused to upload lecture recordings to us so we only had the book and slides. His reasoning being we should be reading the textbook in advance and come to class for clarification, but he never told us the chapters we should be reading. On top of that he was giving us quizzes on material he hadn't taught yet. He justified it by saying that he offered a total of 20 late days for assignments, but that point is kind of moot when you have a hard enough time preparing yourself",501
keleher,3,A,CMSC424,Mediocore professor. The lecture and slides are somehow vague and disorganized. But do cares about students' needs. ,501
keleher,2,A,CMSC424,"I did well in his class but I basically self taught the entire curriculum. The textbook is your friend if you can't get anything from the lectures. He wouldn't upload lecture recordings which I found quite annoying, and spending so much extra time reading the textbook for quizzes on material we didn't even learn in class yet was also quite annoying. The late days, exams, and assignments were fair but the assignments sometimes had vague descriptions. Overall, if you want to take CMSC424 and you have to take it with Peter, do it. I wouldn't avoid him for the sake of avoiding him, but don't expect it to be the best class....",501
keleher,1,A,CMSC424,"Worst professor I've had at umd. His lectures are boring and useless. He doesn't even upload them and refuses to send them to anyone even if they were sick (although he records them!). His quizzes are due at noon (before lecture) and the material on the quiz is taught after the quiz's deadline (in lecture). He doesn't care about his students and only answers piazza questions selectively. He does not respond to emails and does not make ANY sort of accommodations/exceptions to help his students. Even though I did well in the class, I genuinely believe that he wants students to fail and doesn't give a f**** about them. Do NOT take him for any class!",501
keleher,3,A,CMSC424,"He's an average professor, but the class was pretty good overall. We had weekly quizzes and project assignments, and we had three exams (no final). The lectures were kinda boring, but the lecture slides were useful and a good resource for studying for exams. The most annoying thing about the class is that the quizzes were based on content that we didn't learn yet, which meant that we had to learn topics ourselves using the textbook. I still think overall the class and the coursework was pretty fair, and the class isn't any better or worse than other 400 level cs classes.",501
shawhan,3,B,PHYS121,"Beware, his homework is impossible. I would always go to the physics help classroom and spend 3 hours there with other students from this class. However his tests are not bad and he's a nice guy so if you know what he lectures on you will do fine on the tests. ",503
shawhan,4,A,PHYS121,"Professor Shawhan is a great teacher.  He doesn't do that many problems in class and the homework is difficult but in the end, that's how you learn.  I really came out of this course with a solid understanding of the basic concepts, which is key to doing well on the MCAT.  Take Shawhan!  An A is definitely doable as long as you can follow the textbook, which is pretty good.  He posts all of his notes online after class which is a really big plus.  ",503
shawhan,5,A,PHYS121,"Shawhan is one of the few professors I've had (in the three years I've been at UMD) that genuinely cares about his students; I would definitely take another class with him.

I feel that most of the poor reviews he's gotten are from younger students who are just looking to get an easy A, and fulfill a physics requirement. 

While most of the material is complicated for someone with no exposure to physics, he realizes that 121 is for non-majors, and does everything in his power to make it as painless as possible:

He has a tablet computer which he uses to annotate his lecture slides before posting online, clicker questions are not graded for correctness (despite the fact that they are a large portion of the grade), and he allows for note sheets during exams. 

His homeworks can be challenging, but that's the point of the homework; there is an abundance of resources to help with it; the homeworks are very straight forward. 

Anyone who thinks that Shawhan is not an excellent professor is in for an unpleasant surprise when they take any course beyond freshman level. ",503
shawhan,5,AB,PHYS410,"I've had Prof. Shawhan for two different courses, PHYS171 and PHYS410, and I can say that he is one my most favorite professor I've had here at Maryland. Contrary to what others have said, his exams reflect the lectures/homework really well. I've never been surprised by one of his exams, but that doesn't mean they aren't difficult. He truly does challenge you to think, and not just mechanically produce an answer.

He posts all the notes, which are extremely good by the way, online. Always has tests reviews, weights heavily on homework (which is nice), and truly wants you to understand the material. I feel the people who criticize Prof. Shawhan is because they're bitter about receiving a bad grade in which they probably deserve.  ",503
shawhan,5,,PHYS410,"Professor Shawhan is pretty good at explaining concepts, has great lecture slides that he writes into a pdf program as he projects it during class, and is quite genuinely EXTREMELY nice.

I almost gave a rating of a 4 simply because his lecturing style could still use a bit of work--entertaining student questions is usually good, but occasionally he lets a student go on too long or spends too much time on a small detail. Also, since what he writes into the program he later posts, he tries to be careful about his spelling/etc., which probably takes a minute or two cumulative out of every 50 minute lecture, but not exactly a big deal, so I decided it didn't merit a lower rating.",503
shawhan,5,A-,PHYS121,"I wish Dr. Shawhan was teaching 122 because I would take a class taught by him again in a heartbeat! He's a great professor who really does care about his students. While he focuses more on theory, he does go over actual equations in his lectures (as opposed to some professors). His homework is hard, but if you try it and then go to office hours, the TAs will help you. I don't think I ever got more than a point off on homework if I went to the TAs for help. Tests were definitely tricky, but very doable. His final was harder than the semester tests, or maybe just trickier. I got tripped up, and our class exam average was way below other test averages from the semester. He doesn't waste a lot of time on experiments, but when he pulls them out they're a nice way to break up the lecture. He gives clicker questions in lecture, but will give you exceptions if your clicker is broken for that day. He also carries extra clicker batteries with him to class.

Labs can be graded a bit harshly. I felt that there wasn't a lot of guidance as to what they really wanted in a lab report. They felt like a waste of time, as did the discussions, which are actually ""tutorials"". ",503
shawhan,5,AB,PHYS121,"Dr. Shawhan utilizes technology really well and is always open to questions or review.  He assigns a lot of homework, but it keeps you on top of the material.  If you go to office hours, Dr. Shawhan or the TAs help a lot on homework or in general.  I never had physics before this class, but I put in the effort and learned a lot.  Overall, I really enjoyed his class. Tutorial and lab were pointless though.",503
shawhan,3,CB,PHYS121,"This class was one of the most stressful classes I've ever taken (that includes orgos I & II). Dr. Shawhan gives a lot of homework every week. While he says it should only take about 1.5hrs/assignment, my study group found that it took us about 4-5 on average. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course, and look to do practice problems outside of what he assigns. The test questions are not always things you've seen before. His lectures are heavy on theory, but all the test questions are application questions. In short, this class is a lot of work, and Dr. Shawhan doesn't necessarily make physics easy to learn. If it weren't for my fiance having a masters in aerospace engineering, I would be sunk in this course. ",503
shawhan,4,,PHYS121,"Professor Shawhan is a rare example of a professor who truly cares about his students. He is incredibly passionate about physics and provides you with all of the resources you need to do well. There is a lot of homework and sometimes the lab and tutorial can be pretty pointless, but all in all it is pretty helpful in learning the material. ",503
shawhan,2,B,PHYS121,"It really pains me to have to give this man a bad review. He's honestly a really nice man. I just don't think he understands that this is an INTRO to physics course. This means that a lot of people hadn't seen this material before. He gave weekly homeworks that required at least 3-5 hours of work. And yes you would think that would help you on the exams. However, all of his exams were at least 3 times harder than the homework he gave out. People did so terribly on the exams that he allowed people to redo 2 problems (~8-10% points) so that his curve wasn't so that people who received less than 50% got a C. Each test was worth 10%, homework was worth 20% and clicker questions were worth 10%. That is the ONLY reason why people got B's in this class. Other things besides your exam grade factored in. If you have to take Shawhan, if you get A's on the labs and homeworks and go to every class (for the clicker) and get C's on the exams, you'll get a B for your final grade.

Like I said, he's a really nice man. You could tell he was really passionate about physics because he got so excited up there. However, it's in a HUGE lecture hall and he insisted on taking up half of the class time doing experiments that NOONE except the first few rows could see. They often didn't work. 

If you have the chance to take someone else, DO IT!",503
shawhan,2,B,PHYS121,"Sad to say, I agree with the other reviews. People who are just generally good at physics did well in the class. I hadn't seen physics in years so its safe to say it was new to me. He spends lectures going over proofs for the formulas, teaching concepts, and doing demonstrations. But when it came to exam time, it was all calculations of problems. The tests were so hard. He tried really hard to teach us and you can tell that he truly cares that you learn the material. He gave tons of practice problems to do before the exams but they didn't seem to help me at all. 
He gives an A LOT of homework. BY FAR, the most work I have ever done for a class. The reason he's not a good lecturer is because he tries to say too much in such a short period of time. It's way too much to keep up with. It's almost impossible to take notes when he's talking so fast. 
In my opinion, if you have to take Professor Shawhan, just make sure you have the ability to teach yourself from the book. And unless you are just inherently a genius, you shouldn't expect more than a B in this class. ",503
shawhan,4,A-,PHYS121,"Dr. Shawhan is honestly one of the most engaging, enthusiastic, and passionate professors I have had at Maryland, as a junior, I have had a fair share of rotten ones.  He does awesome demonstrations, and explains concepts but also does examples (which always tend to show up on the exams).  The exams are short, 50 points, and he gives you the chance to ""re-do"" problems for more credit, this is his idea of the curve.  It's really not that bad, just find a group of friends to do homework with every week (since it's work like a quarter of your grade and is easy points).  Take good notes, don't bother using the textbook, the online homework and classnotes are perfect for studying.  Relax, and remember he wants to CHALLENGE you to THINK.  Unlike the other rotten Phys professors who ask you to memorize.  Yeah it may suck, but if you plan on succeeding in life, taking the MCAT, or any other test, you're gonna need to know HOW to do physics, not just to memorize an equation, and he teaches you that!  HIGHLY recommended.",503
shawhan,1,,PHYS121,"Professor Shawhan is probably one of the worst teachers I have had at UMD. He is a very nice person, but he cannot teach very well at all. He will teach a lot of concept based information in class, and give completely calculation based exams, without going over examples thoroughly. His tests are very difficult, and although he does curve, it does not help everyone out. If you have a background in physics, and are good at it, then he might be the one for you, but if you are new to the subject, I would avoid him, unless you are very good at teaching yourself out of the book (which still probably won't help you).
",503
shawhan,1,B,PHYS121,"I would definitely avoid taking Shawhan.  He is very nice guy but is one of the worst professors I've ever had.  I read the textbook, did the homeworks, attended a weekly GSS session, went to every lecture, studied extremely hard for every exam and never got above a C on any exam.  This is because the test questions are 100% unrelated to anything he ever gives you before the exam.  He spends too much class time going over demonstrations but not enough time explaining what the demo should be teaching us so that we can then apply it to physics problems.  His tests do not accurately display your knowledge of the material presented to you.  He does curve every exam but not enough to get you the grade you would like.  ",503
shawhan,1,,PHYS410,"Shawhan is a professor that I would recommend avoiding, especially if you are hoping to get an A in the class. While he does curve, it is not the most generous curve. He assigns a LOT of homework, and it is rather difficult to do it since he doesn't do a very good job presenting the material. He is a really nice guy though, and he will often give extensions on assignments if you simply ask for it. This does not make up for the fact that he is awful at presenting material, assigns a lot of homework, and writes very difficult exams because he does not do a good job of assessing the difficulty of his assignments.",503
shawhan,5,A,PHYS171H,Best lecturer I've ever experienced in both high school and college thus far. Get him if you can. I have no idea why he's rated so low.,503
shawhan,5,A,PHYS273,"Prof. Shawhan was fantastic. He managed to navigate the switch to online classes relatively seamlessly, and I still feel like I learned a lot in the class and feel ready for next semester.",503
deshong,4,B,CHEM241,"Often heard very harsh things about Professor Deshong but it is not always true. I like to think that negative feedback most times come from lazy students. So I enjoyed his class. He is as many have said a great lecturer. He knows what he is talking about, you will def learn a great deal about Orgo 2. He does expect his students to have a solid background in Orgo 1. So make sure that you know your SN1, SN2, E1,E2 Concepts very well. His test often did caught me off guard but I didn't think that they were impossible. ",504
deshong,5,A,CHEM241,"DeShong is great! All I ever want from professors is for them to be clear and teach what they test and DeShong meets that perfectly. His lectures are well organized and he has central concepts that he holds through the whole class, which really gives you an understanding of orgo and not just a random set of mechanisms to memorize. 

I also just want to stress how great his test set up is. The first page always has exactly the same kind of material so you know exactly what to study and know and exactly what to work on. The weighting is fair, and the questions are always things that you would expect based on how much time he spend on it in lecture. There were a few confusing issues with grading done by other graders but they were at least consistent, and he has very clear instructions and reminders for submitting regrades if you need it. 

He includes biochem in his lectures and other cool stories and facts about chemistry which is super fun! If you're someone who hates all of it you'll probably find it less interesting but it definitely kept lecture engaging and kept the class interesting, which is especially important for an 8am class.

tl;dr TAKE DESHONG!! You'll learn orgo, it'll be interesting, and you won't get screwed over",504
deshong,3,B,CHEM241,"Unlike in the math department, professors in the chem department are allowed to write their own finals emphasizing whatever they think is important, so regardless of how the professor is themselves it's important to consider what sort of test taker you are.

In De Shong's case, there is less emphasis on procedural thinking (synthesis isn't as present as it was on my Orgo I prof's tests) and more on memorization of biochemical processes and structures. That's not to say things like mechanisms aren't the meat and potatoes of the course because that's gonna be the case with ANY professor, but you'll probably prefer De Shong if you are a pre-med memorization machine or biochem major because it'll give you an edge over the other students. Also, if you don't learn through lecture and just skip it, I wouldn't recommend taking De Shong because participation points via clicker questions can make a pretty big difference. He doesn't care if you stay after the first 5 minutes, but showing up in the first place can be a pain.

As for the man himself, he was alright. Has a funny rude sort of humor and sometimes tells cool anecdotes related to that day's lecture. I thought he spent too much time focusing on biochem, but that's something that comes down to your preference. Overall, I personally would have chosen another professor for this course because I'm not biochem but he is not bad to have by any means. 

(And that comment by that other reviewer about orgo as a second is spot on. USE THAT BOOK.)",504
deshong,5,A,CHEM241,"DeShong is absolutely hilarious and is the best lecturer I have ever had at UMD. His exams are soooooooo fair and there are no synthesis problems! Also, his NMR problems are soooo simple compared to other orgo professors. He mainly cares about mechanisms and reagents. HOWEVER, this class is inherently difficult no matter who you take it with. To do well in Dr.DeShong's class, I had to put in a little bit of work almost every day and read the orgo 2 bible (a.k.a orgo as a second language). Take this class with him, put in the work, and you won't regret it! ",504
deshong,5,A,CHEM241,"This man. omg. Phillip is my homeboy and if you don't take him, you are making a big mistake! He is great at teaching, always keeps things interesting, and loves to touch on biochem at least once each lecture, which is nice because you see it in your later bio classes and it's mindblowing because you first saw it from DeShong. I have no idea why, but our 8 am sections scored like 50% averages on the tests. The tests were honestly not that hard. They were very fair, and after the first exam, you know EXACTLY what to expect on future exams - format is always consistent. If you want ridiculous tests, and synth problems, see Dixon.

DeShong is very approachable, super friendly, and is HILARIOUS. Seriously, I couldn't have had a better 8 am. Clicker questions were kinda annoying because of glitches with setup and losing credit for stuff like that...but DeShong's attitude totally made up for it. He has great handwriting!! Also he is the sassiest man to have roamed the chem building and genuinely wants his students to do well, even if some dudes on here are saying that he's impossible or whatever. Honestly, it is okay. Just practice problems on your own time and you are A-ok! DeShong 4 eva.",504
deshong,4,B,CHEM241,"Dr. DeShong is the best Chem lecturer I have had so far.  I really looked forward to his lectures.  But his test are a real challenge and the grading on his tests is unforgiving.  But there is the curve.

My only complaints:  I wish he gave a list of all the reactions he expected us to know from day one.  The department needs to find a better textbook.

Orgo II is a VERY time consuming course.  Tons of reactions to memorize and many challenging concepts.  You need to do lots of problems.  So I would highly recommend that you do not have any other classes which are time consuming when taking this course.",504
deshong,1,F,CHEM241,"Class sucks some serious b*tt. Do not EVER take this man. Averages on each exam was about 45-49% range. UMD is probably putting his @$$ on probation after this semester.

If I could give this troll 0 stars I would.",504
deshong,3,,CHEM237,"He is a GREAT lecturer and very approachable. He welcomes questions and really wants you to participate in lecture. He also has weekly review sessions where you can ask questions and do practice problems. However, he does push you hard! He expects a lot out of his students. His tests were very, very hard. I think our test average was in the fifties or sixties. He also doesn't drop any hints about his exams. The questions are really unpredictable.",504
deshong,5,B+,CHEM241,"Take Orgo with Dr. DeShong if you can.

Dr. DeShong is extremely knowledgeable in organic chemistry. He explains everything very well, and really only tested us on stuff he taught in lecture; the book was only used as a guide and for practice problems. 

He also made the class interesting - even though I did better in orgo 1, I truly appreciated the subject matter and really understood what was going on.

Dr. DeShong is also hilarious. His commentary and funny verbal musings made every lecture enjoyable. I rarely left class without laughing at least once. 

The curve wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. I think a 75% was an A. 

Dr. DeShong's knowledge, fairness, humor, and overall ability to relay his chemical passion to his students makes him a fine professor. take him take him take him.",504

The book is just there for practice problems and to reinforce the information.  He can be a little pretentious, but I thought he was kind of funny in that rude way.  He is definitely helpful if you ask him for it.  He is extremely knowledgeable in o-chem and definitely knows what he is talking about.  He made the class really interesting. ",504

gaudry,5,A,BSCI452,Awesome professor. This class is pretty tough but he is by far one of the most qualified professors in the bio department. He does a lot of research but equally cares about his class. Exams are tough but if you look through material before class and dont cram you'll be fine,512
gaudry,4,A-,BSCI452,"Professor Gaudry is one of the greatest professors I have had at the University of Maryland. He is funny and entertaining which helped keep me engaged in this class and also clearly conveys the material. He sometimes puts weird questions on the exam and I don't remember discussing them in class but otherwise the exams were fair and honestly could have been a lot harder, so I was grateful for that. The class itself is very difficult but very rewarding if you spend the necessary time on it. My advice would be to spend time every week reviewing the anatomy at the very least.  ",512
mohapatra,4,,,"He was not the best lecturer. He had a somewhat convoluted teaching style without a lot of examples incorporated. In the end, I learned everything from the book.

He's definitely one of the better physics professors here. ",513
mohapatra,4,,,"I had mixed feelings about the class.  Mohapatra was an extremely sweet and nice man who is willing to help you when you go into office hours.  During lecture though he tends to teach more of the theory and proof behind why things are the way they are.  I know that since I struggle with physics that wasn't too helpful for me.  He has announced weekly quizzes based off the chapter you recently learned.  His tests were very fair and I was never caught off guard by a question - I just sucked at physics.  

Other reviews say his accent was hard to understand, but only a few times was I unsure about what he was saying.  He's very funny in class because he'll do demos to help teach a concept to the class and a lot of the times they don't work and a student helps him figure it out.  They're pretty funny because he's such a happy older man who loves physics.",513
mohapatra,5,A,,"PHYS260 is a difficult class, but Dr. Mohapatra tries his best to help his students understand every concepts taught. The reviews below say that his accent is what gets you and he has pop quizzes. These are all incorrect statements. His accent is fine... he has one, but that is not an issue at all. He welcomes and encourages all students to his office with open arms and tries his best to teach you anything you are confused on. I am horrible at physics (I got a B in PHYS161) but I managed to get an A in this class. If I took a different professor, I defintely would not have gotten the grade I received. Saying this, I am not saying that Mohapatra's exams are easier (I would say they were harder than the other class) but he teaches concepts pretty darn well.

Tests were not too difficult, but don't expect to get anywhere without reading the book. The Mastering Physics assignments ranged a bit in difficulty, but were probably the single most useful part of the course. Doing well in this class is all about practicing a variety of problems, and Dr. Mohapatra didn't assign a bunch of single bar problems like the other teacher (Bantu) did.

I personally found his accent entertaining and very easy to understand, and I also thought he was pretty funny. He's very responsive by e-mail, and is extremely understanding about grading concerns. You probably won't find much better teachers for PHYS270.",513
mohapatra,2,,PHYS161,"Funny dude in lecture, but is very difficult to understand.  Take a different teacher.

Wants to get to know students, so he's good in his limited office hours, but that's the best I can say.",513
mohapatra,2,C,PHYS161,"If you've taken some form of physics before then the class will be pretty straightforward, but Mohapatra's accent made it near impossible to learn anything from the lecture.  However, he's a nice enough guy and seemed willing to help if you took the time to go to him and ask questions.  Quizzes and homework were annoying, but I probably learned more from those than the lectures.  Sad thing is, he's probably one of the better physics professors on campus (the least bad of the physics professors if that makes sense) and I would take him over most of the other physics professors.",513
mohapatra,2,,PHYS161,Go to discussion. I made the mistake of not going and learned nothing. His teaching style and accent aren't helpful either. The book won't help you either.,513
mohapatra,4,A,PHYS161,"Giving weekly quizzes isn't such a bad thing. You actually learn under this guy, and he is a riot. His demonstrations and explanations are very entertaining. He was also really nice and approachable in his office hours and help me make up they exams I missed. ",513
mohapatra,2,A,PHYS161,"I did not really get much out of his lectures. They were so boring and his accent got on my nerves. I learned by doing the written homework and masteringphysics. Even though masteringphysics was a huge pain, I actually did get something out of it. He did make jokes occasionally and some were actually funny. The first midterm was easy but the second and third ones were kind of difficult. The final was not that bad. 

Best advice is to go to office hours, go to discussion class, do the homework in a timely manner, and try to do as many other practice problems from the book. ",513
mohapatra,1,,PHYS161,"Mohapatra in my opinion should stick to teaching grad courses. Not only are his lectures extremely boring, but he makes it a nuisance for students to not go to class. He gives a weekly quiz, which is good and all, but gives them on sporadic times to his whim. 
In addition, his accent does put a large barrier in terms of learning. If you don't like powerpoints, or find yourself falling asleep while looking at them, do not join his class. He's not a very good teacher. Nice guy, but he definitely doesn't know how to convey the information over to students.
He's also quite unreasonable when it comes to problems with the online homework. ",513
mohapatra,2,,PHYS161,"Although Mohapatra appears to know his stuff, he doesn't teach very clearly. His accent is an unfortunate barrier, it took me half the semester to get used to it. He used masteringphysics which was a disaster because there were glitches with the program. Despite many complaints, he remained indifferent to the fact that many people had low homework grades because the online homework wasn't working correctly. He usually just gives confusing proofs in class and doesn't always point out which forumlas are worth knowing. He is, however, very eager to help anyone who comes to office hours or makes an appointment so if you don't understand something, take some time to see him after class. Despite his confusing explanations, he is happy to help anyone who is truely interested.",513
mohapatra,4,C-,PHYS260,"He was the sweetest man. I always went to his office hours because he would spend time with me, explain things to the best of his ability and truly care if i learned the material. Now I was not very good at physics but he def curved fairly and somehow had me pass",513
mohapatra,5,A+,PHYS260H,"This dude was hilarious, especially when he did the demos for any topics we covered. He's one of the greatest professors of all time, and 260 was one of the best classes I've taken at UMD. I absolutely would not take the class again since I learned the content so well, but I would take another of his classes again in a heartbeat. The only thing I disliked was mastering physics, but I guess they don't really have any other way of assigning homework for these huge lecture classes.",513
mohapatra,2,B-,PHYS260,Really bad lectures. Very nice guy but seems out of touch. Tell you something that will be on a test and the test will have something completely different.,513
mohapatra,4,A+,PHYS260,"Mohapatra is a really sweet old man, and I'm sure he would've been a great lecturer had we been in-person. Unfortunately, he's simply not a very effective teacher online, and teaches off PowerPoints with the most atrocious formatting you've ever seen. He attempts to show solutions to example problems but it just isn't the same effect as seeing one being solved handwritten. Gives quizzes and exams that I would say were mostly fair.",513
mohapatra,4,B,PHYS260,"His lectures didn't cover everything in the textbook, but I think they were easy to follow. He tried to make sure every person understood each concept, and seemed excited to teach and enjoyed talking to students. His quizzes were fair and he usually would give hints as to what questions and topics were on them, and they were usually similar to the example problems he showed during lectures.",513
mohapatra,4,A+,PHYS260H,"He is a sweet guy, but in the online format he did not use the technology well and taught purely off slides. His lectures covered derivations and concepts and we did not do that many practice problems in class. The exams were fair except for the final, but there was a huge curve at the end of the class.",513
pinker,3,A,GEOL123,"This class is really not too challenging at all.  Almost all the lecture material is posted online and the exams aren't too overwhelming.  The only downside to this class is that is usually work done in discussion, so you really should attend-there's also quizzes every couple of weeks, too.  However, most of the time discussion will at least be an opportunity to boost your grade and depending on who your TA is, it might not be a lot of work.  The only big discussion assignment was the Kyoto project near the end, but that wasn't even bad.

Although most of this class is okay, a big negative about this class is that it's co-taught by 3 professors, so it seems a big ""scattered"" and overwhelming at times.  Just make sure you go through the slides before exams (there are two midterms and a final) and ask any questions about the material and you should be okay...Pinker is not the greatest lecturer at all though, so my advice is sit near the front when she lectures so you can pay close enough attention to what she says...and make sure you look at her material very closely......good luck!",514
pinker,4,B+,AOSC123,"It's pretty clear that her main problem is that she's not very tech-savvy. Unfortunately, since many times require technology these days sometimes it does seem like she's a little scattered. I personally found her slides very helpful when studying for exams so I didn't attend lectures as much since the slides were posted online. There are clickers for participation so remember to show up for the class!",514
pinker,1,A,AOSC123,"Homework takes an unnecessary amount of time, exams are very difficult. I'm only taking this class to fulfill my non-lab requirement, and this class has more work than my major accounting classes. Only take if you have absolutely no other options",514
pinker,5,A-,AOSC123,"This has been one of my favorite courses at UMD. This lady is like a cute grandma. She makes jokes and laughs at them herself which is so cute to watch. Her lectures can get boring because they are so long, but the topics are interesting and apply to your life. As long as you do your work, you should get an A",514
pinker,3,,AOSC400,"Professor Pinker is a nice lady that cares about her students. She wants her students to interact with her and ask questions. Those who ask questions often get detailed replies that help reinforce course material. However, I took this course online (asynchronously) and it is easy to tell that she is not super comfortable using technology. She got much better at uploading and recording videos as the semester progressed, but there were still some technological lapses that impeded learning. In her lectures, she was often just reading from the slides and putting random formulas without an explanation for them. Slides were unorganized and not easy to follow. The course itself is not difficult in content, as it does not require an extensive math background and is mostly conceptual. The homework and exams were fairly straightforward, provided that you read the textbook. Overall, an interesting course that could be taught better with more enthusiasm from the professor and better technology skills.",514
rudinger,1,A,CMSC470,"I'm not questioning her knowledge of the course materials or anything, but Rudinger definitely needs to prepare for each of the lectures/slides before presenting. Even though this probably isn't the case, it feels as if she just got the slides for a day's lecture THE SAME DAY and just decided to read off the slide contents instead of actually preparing to be asked questions. No one even asked questions because she was going so fast that we couldn't even process. It's almost like she was trying to get the lectures over with quickly because maybe she has stage fright or is embarrassed about not fully knowing everything in the slides, but we're not attending lecture to judge her or for a performance, we're just in class to learn course materials.

She does not create her own slides at all (which isn't the worst part, many professors probably don't). The worst part is that it does not even feel like she has read or prepared for the slides. Almost a majority of the class (80-90% of the time), she is reading directly from the slides and even gets lost sometimes.
Constantly trips up or uses synonyms of words to make the presentation have more flare, but listening in during lectures were honestly painful.

Course assignments and grading were a mess as well. We had 2 homework assignments covering topics for the midterm, and the second homework wasn't even graded until the last three weeks of the semester (yes you read that correctly).

I will say that this is probably her very first time ever leading or teaching a course and the pandemic was still going on, so she may have potential for improvement. But from what I saw, there is a LOT of room for improvement.",515
balan,5,A,AMSC420,"Amazing professor that really knows how to teach content at a high level while also making it simple enough for beginners to learn anything. Really nice and gets to know his students well enough to support them throughout the course, even ran my code for my final project because my computer wasn't able to handle it. No problem for him, ran it as soon as I emailed and immediately got back with my code results. Helps his students out wherever possible, and definitely cares more about his students learning than handing out grades. Awesome guy, couldn't recommend him enough.",516
rosca,1,,MATH240,"Absolutely the worst teaching experience I’ve had in my life. Dr. Rosca’s research better be damn good, because her teaching could not be worse. She excels at leaving students confused, upset, and totally lost. You could get an A without ever attending lecture, and by the same token you can attend every lecture and still fail if the material confuses you, as it did me. Avoid at all costs.",517
rosca,5,A,MATH463,"Dr. Rosca is a very good teacher. She explains very difficult concepts systematically and is always available if you have any questions or concerns. Some of the other reviews said her exams were atrocious; I don't think that's fair. Her class is all about mastery and gaining mathematical maturity. If you do the homework and THINK, you'll be fine.",517
rosca,3,,MATH240,"The actual class isn't that hard, in my opinion. However, I think Rosca could have done a better job with engaging the class. She reads off PowerPoints for most of her lectures, which I thought was a bit obscure. Some of the material that was a bit confusing wasn't taught very well by her, so I had to rely on YouTube to teach me some of the concepts. She's very nice at office hours though, so go to those if you need additional one-to-one help. Although not terrible, you should probably see if you can get a different professor for Linear Algebra.",517
rosca,3,B-,MATH240,"She's pretty mediocre as an instructor. She does have the slides that have a good deal of the most important info in the book displayed for you, so it's a good way to guide your notes. Bring the book with you to class so you can write in notes if you fall behind the lecture. She's got an accent(surprise, surprise) and has a drab monotone, and isn't particularly good at communicating material, but she can help you in office hours. 
A good TA will help tremendously, but one with yet another accent, that moves through material very quickly, like mine, will leave you reeling for your book to study yourself. It's not a bad idea, anyway, since just about everything you need to know in the course is in it, and all the homework exercises are in it. 
I think this is in every 240 section, but watch out for the MATLAB projects. If you go in with no MATLAB experience and little to no CompSci experience, prepare for long nights of figuring things out. If you've never used MATLAB before, maybe try MATH206 or play around with it before you take this course.
One more thing: 100 points are for quizzes in discussion based on homework(12 total, 2 dropped, 10 points each), 100 for four MATLAB projects(graded out of 25), 300 for three 100 point midterms, and 200 for the final, for 700 total. One nice thing she did is if you do better on the final than on your lowest midterm (going by percentages), then 1/2 of the points you earn on the final will replace your lowest midterm, in addition to your final grade out of 200. Great for a final-exam recovery if one of your exams sucked.
In summary, she's not that good of a teacher, but she does a good job setting up the course to help you succeed if you put in the work. I couldn't avoid Rosca, as she taught every 240 section this semester, but shop around and see if there's someone better. If not, at least she's not so bad that it would worth putting off a required course that only she teaches that particular semester.",517
rosca,3,A+,MATH240,"Dr. Rosca was an all around good professor. Her midterms were fair and her final was easy. She also replaces your lowest midterm with your percentage from your final if higher and drops two of the weekly quizzes. Many people do not show up to class since she teaches out of the book and uses Powerpoints also on Elms, but she was a decent lecturer. Rosca had a bad reputation from being hard the previous semester and especially hardly curving, but this semester her grades were overall higher. ",517
rosca,1,A-,,"Avoid this professor however you can. A majority of people I have asked have said the same thing about her: she is a terrible teacher. Her introductions to topics give you no better understanding of the material and she often leaves you confused. If you do well in this class, it will have had nothing to do with this professor. You could miss 95% of the lectures and still get an A. I prefer a professor that could at least help me out in starting to understand the material. Only take her class if her section is the only one that fits into your schedule, otherwise, steer clear of her.",517
rosca,3,A+,MATH115,"Dr. Rosca gets a bit of a bad rap. Halfway through the semester, she began allowing us to bring notes for the quizzes and exams. She's very responsive to concerns and set up an online forum to discuss previous exams from the testbank. Still, not much gets done during lecture. As with ANY math class, you have to study outside of class.",517
rosca,1,W,MATH115,The worst teacher I have ever had. If you can avoid taking her class you probably should because she will teach you nothing and punish you for it. Had to drop the class mid-semester.,517
rosca,2,B+,MATH115,Attendance is required through daily quizzes. That wouldn't be a problem if they were worth going too. Attending lecture is no better than just reading the book and watching a Youtube video.,517
rosca,2,A-,MATH115,She was a terrible professor. She has a thick accent (tee-tah!) and doesn't really teach concepts well. She is so bad at making online quizzes and has many mistakes in her pre-lecture quiz keys. Webassign was some shit too. She lets you have a cheat sheet (front and back) for exams though.,517
rosca,1,B-,MATH401,"This professor can't teach at all. Every time we are doing a problem from previous midterm/final exam, she always struggled to explain how to do it. I am completely loss during the lecture and review session. Only few students who are above average could follow her. ",517
rosca,1,C-,MATH115,"terrible, no words to describe this lady just god awful at her job. she just doesn't even try and relies on the TAs to save the students. Save urself while you can! I would give 0 stars if I could.",517
rosca,1,A,MATH115,"This professor is SO confusing and far from helpful when you have an issue or are confused. The only reason I am getting an A is because it is precalc and I took calculus in high school, so if you took it before it is bearable but if not, good luck. The only good thing is that after we stress out about quizzes or tests and take them, she will just cross them off and they won't count in the final grade, but it is still frustrating seeing grades of 10/10 not be accounted for. The actual course content and assignments are easy and you have multiple attempts on the majority of them so that is a plus but as for her as a professor, she is awful. ",517
rosca,4,A,MATH115,"TBH this class was pretty rough in the beginning because it was so disorganized and the syllabus was so hard to understand. Rosca was not very undrrstanding at all. And I quite frankly got a C on the 1st exam. BUT, besides all that happened before the first exam, the class started getting better! Rosca actually compensated for our needs and asks for our opinion on the format of the exam (we even got a test that was supposed to be wednesday pushes back to friday). The TA's were all extremely helpful as well as the GSS sessions were extremely beneficial especially right before an exam. On the second exam I got a 97.5 (I woulda gotten a 100 but I made stupid mistakes) and the third exam I got a 88 (there were two questions I wasnt very confident in and those were the ones I lost points on) So overall, I give a solide 4 stars to her as a professor. If it wasn't for usthe students voicing our concerns out to her a few times during lecture I dont really think those changes would actually have happened. Just make sure you study like at least a week before the exam, complete all the practice test provided, and ask questions the TA office hours because there are litterally there to help you. Lastly, she gives many opportunties for bonus points like surveys, posting on piazza, little freebie assignments. So if you fail this class its on you.",517
rosca,3,A-,MATH115,"Rosca wasn't a bad teacher. She knew what she was talking about, but didn't know how to explain some things so the students would understand. Most of the students taking this class already took pre-calculus or calculus before so she expects you to know or have a general understanding of the material before she teaches it.  There are plenty of resources for you to pass this class. Definitely email your TA if you have any questions! ",517
rosca,3,A-,MATH115,"Rosca has a bad rep, which is understandable. Her accent makes it really hard to understand her, and sometimes when she explains things it becomes even more confusing. But to anyone who has to take her class, I really recommend going to her office hours. She's really great one-on-one, and many of the confusing concepts that are presented in lectures are easily explained if you just ask. ",517
rosca,3,A-,MATH115,"Rosca is alriiiiight. Her accent is difficult to understand. The grade distribution was CRAZY. There were so many homework that counted toward like almost nothing % of your grade. She was disorganized all the time, but exams were fair, I'd say.",517
rosca,3,B+,,"Dr. Rosca isn't a bad teacher... but let's be real, I hated this class. I don't think this kind of stuff needs to be taught. Once you have pre-calc 1 and 2 you should be good to move on to calc, I have no idea why a ""calc prep"" class is needed exclusively for UMD and I feel bad for everyone involved.

I don't find her accent distracting. She'll pronounce ""these"" like ""zees"" and ""those"" like ""zhose"" and I find it kind of charming, like I'm at Oxford or something. 
There are a LOT of assignments in this class, but its ok. I bombed almost all of my tests and did the WA/Exam Prep and got 90s-95s on those and wound up managing. ",517
duraiswami,5,A,AMSC460,"Duraiswami is a VERY friendly person and a great professor (almost an Indian Winnie the Pooh!). Class periods are spent going through powerpoints of the material. He explains the material in a very down-to-earth way so that everyone can understand it easily. 

Homework tests your ability to apply the concepts in class in MATLAB. All homework is from the book, so if you don't understand either the lecture slides or the book, you can use the other one as a second resource. Homework is not BS-able, and every question is graded. 

Exams do not have many questions, and thus each question is weighed heavily. The material tested is straight out of the powerpoint slides, so put as much of the slides as you can on your notesheet(s).

Grades are as follows:
25% Midterm (use one note sheet), 35% Final Exam (use two note sheets), 40% homework assignments.",518

If you have the option please take Jacobs instead. Dr. Duraiswami simply reads over slides, didn't truly teach anything, especially if it related to the weekly quizzes or the final, and wouldn't go over quiz answers because somehow we're magically supposed to ""understand"" what we were never actually taught. He also would make a lot of errors, which is perfectly human, but it was never corrected, and some of us can't tell what's right/wrong to be able to immediately correct him. As a result, I never had any real material to study off of and didn't learn enough to know whether what he did was actually correct or not. Also, office hours were very limiting and didn't help much with problem sets. Overall, poorly taught class, and would not take a course with him again.",518

I recorded all his lectures and recopied them later, which proved extremely helpful. There's no room to get behind in this class, because there's a lot of material and he tests you on details. That being said, if you attend lectures and keep up with studying and practice problems, there's no reason not to do well in his class. Discussion was difficult, but they are coordinated by different people than the lecturers. ",521

He's a fantastic lecturer. I do agree with anonymous that he writes and talked extremely fast, but that's because he's got so much to share. He puts the skeleton of his lecture notes online so if you print or copy that out before class you can take notes on that and save yourself some wrist. 

Tests weren't so bad once you figured out what exactly he's asking for. Remember case studies. Discussion actually kinda screwed me over. I had a hard TA so wound up with a lower averaging discussion than on my exams, but hey it happens. 

I actually like how there are weekly quizzes it keeps you on track since 222 is a class that's really easy to fall behind in.

There are quizzes almost every week and something due in discussion every week. The two hour discussions are pretty pointless. Quiz difficulty depends on your TA. Exam difficulty goes up from the first exam and is about equal on the 2nd and 3rd exam. On the exams there are essays, short answers, multiple choice etc. Don't start to study the night before the exam maybe a week or two before and you'll be fine.",521

He is very witty and funny; he makes a few jokes during lecture that gets the entire class laughing. Out of class, he is a very nice person, though he is a bit insane (in a good and funny way).

His tests were rather hard, though. All the material in his exams come STRAIGHT out of his mouth during lecture, so it will behoove you to tape record his lectures and rewrite your notes afterwards since he talks VERY fast. But, if you think you can keep up, then just make sure you write down almost everything he says (including the examples he gives in class - he will ask questions about specific examples in his exams). He usually posts his lecture notes online before lecture, so these will definitely help you take notes.",521

He is very strict about people attending class so he will purposely include questions from class not originally on the note outlines to reward those who come to class.

Exams are not ridiculously hard, only one or two questions require any amount of writing, and they are always straight out of his lectures. If he says something is important or spends more than 10 minutes on something, it'll be on the exam for sure. And you drop your lowest grade anyway.

I take the third test tomorrow, and he is like all teachers and has a ton of material on his exams, but he does honestly make them interesting.

While the textbook is not necessary to do well in 446, Dr. Araneda seemed to use the Purves textbook heavily in his powerpoints and lectures, so reading the textbook made the course pretty straightforward.

Dr. Araneda was also very receptive to questions. He does expect students to come prepared to his office hours (this is an upper level neuroscience course so he wouldn't discuss basic neuro concepts, like action potentials and nernst), but he was more than willing (in my experience) to sit down and spend time discussing the concepts he lectured on.

Overall, I'd recommend taking this course under Dr. Araneda if you thought 353 was interesting but wanted to explore all of the concepts a bit more thoroughly. If you read the textbook and come to class/office hours with relevant questions, the course will be a cinch.",522
araneda,1,,BSCI440,"This is by far the worst professor I have had in my 7semesters at UMD. Im a cell bio and molecular genetics major and I love this stuff. I loved the content of the class but he is a terrible professor. I cannot stress more to never take this guy. He cant teach. He expects you to know everything and doesnt explain well, if at all. I stopped going to lecture after the first exam because I got so mad at how every other sentence he would say, ""Do you guys know that? (2 second pause) Well you should. Look it up."" That got me so angry I just stopped going. I read the book and things made sense. That's how I passed the class. ",522
araneda,2,74,BSCI440,"I made it a point to go to every single lecture at the start of the semester. 9 am class. After a week, I realized how useless they were. But I still went. 3 weeks in, I gave up. Lectures are pointless. He doesn't clearly explain things, he goes over things that don't show up on the exams, and he glides over important parts of the book. So Just read the book. If you want to do well in this class, you have to be vigilant about learning everything yourself. There was a curve at the end though.

The discussions were useful in that you could ask questions to TAs who've taken this class before and have a better idea of what's important to cover. 

Exams were difficult because the material is so dense, the only way to do well is to read the chapters over and over and try your best to synthesize the stuff with his slides. Also, there's stuff that's covered that's not on his slides or in the books, so yeah, enjoy if you're lucky enough to have him.

Teaching is not his calling.",522
araneda,1,A,BSCI446,"Ricardo is a poor professor. Plain and simple. Does not communicate expectations to students and then gets angry when these unspoken expectations are not met. Unenthusiastic with teaching; seems like he is being forced to do this as a component of his contract with the university. Condescending when asked questions; if he decides he's above answering a question of yours, he won't do it and will instead try to make you feel bad by indirectly insulting your intelligence. Overall, not a people person, no teaching ability, and little interest in the well-being of students.",522
nochetto,1,,MATH462,"One of the worst professor you can take, particularly for MATH462. You will have difficulty studying with his answer sheets, since either, most have typos or the wrong way to approach a problem. No need to go to his lectures, he just iterates what is said in the book, and explains it in a much difficult way then the book would. Just as reading the book, is like going to his lectures, you barely learn much about PDE. I suggest you watch videos on youtube, and get a different book that has more examples and better explanations if you have to take this course.  ",524
nochetto,3,B,MATH462,"Professor Nochetto is not really the most exciting professor. He basically reads out of the book and assigns hw from the end of the chapter. Still, You will probably need help frequently and depending on his mood he can either be a complete jackass or very patient. For grading there were 3 tests, hw every week, and a final. 

Overall I would recommend this class if you are an engineer and have learned some of the concepts that are covered. Waves, Heat transfer, and other concepts from physics or transport process classes are covered. So if you already know the concepts its actually pretty interesting to see the math behind it.

If you are just a math major, the math theory is pretty simple but picturing the concepts might be a little challenging. The only reason I got a B was because I didn't study and bombed the final to drop my grade. So as long as you make good decisions you should get a good grade. ",524

Overall I liked him a lot.",525
wentworth,1,D,MATH141,"Wentworth was not a good professor. He can be  monotone while teaching and his lectures are poorly planned. Examples in class were complicated and not helpful. Like others have said, he tends to stop mid-thought during problems, trying to figure out the next step. His tests were hard and had very challenging problems. I felt like I understood the material, but struggled with the difficult of test problems. He made this class much harder than it needed to be. No curve at the end either. Seems like he's a nice guy, but definitely should not be teaching.",526
wentworth,1,B+,MATH246H,"I recommend against taking him if at all possible! He makes things much more complicated than they need to be by speaking and writing in very formal math language. He is not helpful at all in office hours either. He often will lose his train of thought and stand in front of the class and think to himself for several minutes, obviously wasting everyone's time. Makes many small mistakes when doing examples, and is no generous at all giving partial credit on exams and quizzes. If you don't get the correct final answer, you won't get much credit. He is just overall not a good lecturer, and doesn't seem to want students to succeed. ",526
wentworth,2,A,MATH341,"Wentworth was an ok teacher. His lectures can be interesting sometimes or really boring. The main problem with his teaching is his examples. He will often spend much time trying to figure out how to do his own example because he didn't finish up the work before coming to class and he has forgotten how to proceed. 
Also, he often taught methods that were very different from the book's, which makes it hard to go and do the hw for the quizzes. 
Some topics that we were assessed on he only talked about generally for a few minutes without doing any examples.
The other professor, Hunt, had an open book open note policy for all exams, but Wentworth did not, which  was annoying as there are many ways to solve diff eqs and it becomes difficult to keep them all straight.
However, Wentworth is a nice guy and he is fairly approachable, it just would be nice if he prepared more for class. Also, he teaches a little too fast most of the time, so it is hard to wrap your brain around what he has just said before the next topic starts.",526
wentworth,2,A,MATH141,"I did well in this class but ONLY because I had a good TA and because Wentworth's exams were much easier than the other 141 professors at the time. 

His lectures are disjointed, very abstract, and poorly planned. He doesn't bring in notes or examples to do so it gets frustrating watching him try to come up with one on the spot. Brilliant man, not the most approachable guy, bad bad teacher. 

Avoid him if you rely heavily on lectures but if you're good at teaching yourself the material, you may be fine because again his exams are very easy. 

Utilize the Kirwan TA's before exams though, because Wentworth doesn't write the final. The Gulicks do, and the Kirwan TA's essentially belong to the Gulick so they know a lot better.",526
wentworth,2,,MATH141,"He's a nice guy but he is a terrible lecturer! His exams were all right but a bit unpredictable. We also had a lot of questions on our tests that the other MATH141 classes didn't have to learn. His quizzes are unannounced (I guess to get people to go to discussion but it was annoying that I didn't know when to prepare for them). He was incredibly unprepared for lecture and spent much of our time staring at the board trying to figure out where he made a mistake. His examples also didn't make much sense and he never offered clear explanations and instead provided us with vague, beat-around-the bush responses. He was also very boring, mostly because no one knew what he was even talking about. I would definitely not take him.",526
wentworth,2,D,MATH141,"wentworth is the worst math teacher i have had at maryland, and seems to be the worst teacher available for calc 2. i have never recieved any emails from him and he has never replied to one of mine. additionally he does not post grades anywhere. previoius teachers had posted them on webassign or on the math website. he spends class solving his own examples which he has not previously solved. while this is better than a teacher that is just a reverse power point, he is not a sucessful teacher.",526
wentworth,2,C,MATH141,"I am pretty sure this was his first time teaching 141, and it showed. He expected students to understand tricky, new concepts right away. If you asked him questions about exams, he would say, ""Is that all you care about is the exam? just learn it and the exam will not be hard"". Mathlab due every Tuesday and Thursday, they were worthless and tedious. Lecture became useless, learned it all myself from the book. Worked incredibly hard and got a B. Take Gulick or someone else. Maybe he is better at upper levels? but he really sucked as a 141 teacher. Also little or no curve, we will never know because we dont see our final and no contact after class is over.",526
wentworth,2,B,MATH141,Wentworth was at best ok.  He seemed to stumble through his examples and was corrected by students a lot.  He didn't seem to have thought through his lecture and often times made things up.  He would say this is the equation because it is or magically this is the equation.  He does not teach the way the book does.  He has invented his own way of doing problems and teaches those ways but often times cannot explain how he arrived at the equations he is using.  I would only recommend him if you have no previous knowledge of the class because he will teach you in a way no one has before.,526
wentworth,3,B+,MATH141,"I do not think he is a bad teacher, its just that some of his teaching is confusing and when people ask questions, he does not really answer it. Since its hard for me to comprehend him when he teaches cause he pauses alot and says uhh alot i had to teach most of the material myself to get this grade. His exams were fairly easy compared to other lecturers. The other reason i am doing pretty well is because i had probably one of the best math TAs on campus. ",526
wentworth,4,B,MATH241,"The class was pretty straight forward and not bad. Only one matlab assignment the entire year and it was extremely easy. The practice tests are similar to the real exams and if you do the homework and study a little, you will do fine.  ",526
wentworth,4,B,MATH241,"Good professor, knows the material but can go a little fast at times. Says stuff like ""math should be natural"" which is of no help at all but provides a little comic relief to an otherwise boring subject. Take him if you don't want to have to do matlab assignments. He had one at the beginning of the semester but then forgot about it. Tests aren't too difficult, he lectures for his tests so if you pay attention in lecture it isn't too difficult.",526
wentworth,4,B,MATH341,"Nice guy, I found taking 341 with him to be much better than 340 with Cohen. Tests were hard, and the average was low, but most of the material was taken almost directly from the homework. Curve at the end and weight of the final definitely help, I thought I was going to fail and ended up getting a B. Also, no MATLAB assignments was a definite plus.",526
wentworth,3,C,MATH241,"As a person he seems like a nice guy, approachable at least.  As a lecturer he was average, not good or bad.  If you went to lecture you would learn the material and if not you could learn it from the book with some effort.  Exams were kind of hard and he looked for understanding of the material.  Lack of any real MATLAB assignments was a definite plus.  Decent curve, but test averages were pretty low so in the end it doesn't help as much as you'd expect.  Like I said, not a bad professor to take, but not the best either.",526
wentworth,3,C+,MATH241,He rushed towards the end.  The exams were harder than average since he pushed for understanding of material.  He compensated with an OK curve...but I would've not taken the class with him.,526
wentworth,1,B,MATH241,"Wentworth was on a mission to prove that he is a tough professor because this was his first semester at umd.  he said he didnt care if our grades were bad as long as we learned things. unfortunately if, the whole class fails, everyone has to retake it anyways.  if you have a choice, take any other professor.  ",526
wentworth,3,A,MATH241,"Tests were very fair if you took the time to do the homework.  Lectures were decent.  Granted, the average test grades were relatively low, but he did curve in the end.  Take him if you do not want to do a lot of Matlab assignments.  ",526

If you take his class be prepared to learn everything on your own.",528
trevino,1,D,MATH246,"Terrible professor, uncaring human being.

Rodrigo is easily the worst professor I have had the displeasure of having. His teaching style was inconsistent, and the only thing that was consistent was that it was terrible. He copied the online notes (written by Levermore) word for word in class, and tried to administer math quizzes on Canvas - which to me was a sign of laziness, since he didn't want to grade anything himself, dumping it all on our TAs. Additionally, his exams were different than other sections, often containing errors, and he did not curve. When I emailed him on multiple occasions requesting to meet and discuss how to succeed, he never replied. He also only had 2 hours of office hours weekly, on one day, during peak class times, making himself unavailable. Additionally, he missed many lectures for personal trips to ""relieve stress."" He blames our class's low scores on us, and ridiculed us for not taking linear algebra first - even though it is not a prerequisite.

Rodrigo, as a professor, does not represent the quality or type of education the University of Maryland is acclaimed for, and even though it was his first semester teaching it, I strongly feel it should be his last. I will admit some of my strong wording is out of disappointment in failing the class, but that aside, the fact still stands Rodrigo was not an effective teacher, and did not care about his students.

He even had the audacity to email us after the exam and tell us he though the grades were good enough, and that if we failed it is exclusively our fault, essentially telling us to f*** off. The way in which the email was written struck me as very unprofessional, and oblivious to the fact he is a terrible professor.

If you can take this class with anyone else, do it. I sincerely hope to see Rodrigo removed from the faculty of UMD.",528

His exams are easy, immediate results of the online book's formula. 
If you are the kind that heavily rely on lectures and review materials, don't consider him. And try to not take 246. This course has too much to learn.

He genuinely seems to love his job and always comes to class in good spirits, which is hard to do on Zoom. From a grading perspective he's very accommodating if you have any emergencies or other things impacting your schoolwork. The only thing that could have made this class better was if it was in person, as I assume it would have been even more fun.

He's very intimidating at first but if you get to know him you'll realize he's a really nice guy. I think he did a good job teaching this class; needless to say, this was a very challenging course (more so than 412 in my opinion). 

This class is conceptually simple, but the devil truly is in the details. Understanding how packets are routed through the internet is not a trivial matter. This requires understanding link-layer switching, and network-layer routing. I think Bobby did a rather crappy job explaining the link-layer. In particular, he failed to articulate the difference between forwarding and routing (which is HUGE). This certainly led to a lot of confusion.

Either way, take this course with either Bobby or Neil Spring. Enough said.

I had to drop and take the W for the sake of my other classes. Don't believe me? There are currently 15/40 spots open in the class after people dropping, and his average is about a 2.6 based off past years.

via_sara,1,B,BSCI370,"Dr. Via may be a good researcher, but she is not a good professor nor does she appear to be knowledgable about the course material she is supposed to be teaching. Via was simply not effective in communicating course material, and often seemed to become lost in thought trying to process the information on her slides. On many occasions, the professor would stare blankly at the powerpoint while she tried to figure out what the information that most likely she herself had put together, stating (verbatim), ""I'm not really sure what this slide is saying, but you guys should understand it for the test."" I have taken numerous ecology, genetics, animal behavior, and even philosophy of evolution courses prior to taking BSCI370, so I came into this class with considerable knowledge of the subject. I was very excited to take this course because evolution is my major and my passion, and I can honestly say I was very disappointed. 
The questions on the homework assignments were often incoherent, making it impossible to determine the true intention of the question and ultimately resulting in an incorrect answer because the student simply had to guess. When student concerns were brought to Via regarding these incoherent homework questions, she simply stated that she does not do regrades for homework assignments. Even when she had her TA grade the assignments, leaving room for error, Via refused to investigate student concerns about misgrading. The TA was instructed to grade assignments, yet did not seem to be able to apply a greater understanding of the subject matter when student answers strayed slightly from exactly what the rubric said. On one occasion, in regards to hominid evolution and migration to the Americas, Via asked a T/F question on a homework assignment stating ""Early humans migrated from Asia on boats to colonize America"". While this statement has never been in any textbook or published scientific literature upon a detailed search on online search engines, Via had included it in her powerpoint for class, leading the student to believe this answer was correct. In class the day the assignment was due, Dr. Via said that in her ""opinion"", the Bering Strait and Siberia is not a part of Asia, and that was her reasoning for marking that question ""false"". When a student brought her concern to Dr. Via that the Bering Strait and Russia are considered to be part of the Asian continent by the majority of geographical textbooks and societies, she simply stated she didn't agree, so she would keep it marked incorrect on the assignment. 
Overall, this course was extremely disappointing. Dr. Via did not effectively communicate course material, nor demonstrate any understanding of the information she was supposed to be presenting. When a science professor states, ""I'm not sure how people figure out the biomechanics of how fossils lived"", it does not create much confidence in the professor for the student. I am thoroughly disappointed that the course was not informative whatsoever, and the professor was unable to communicate anything outside of the information in the textbook. ",533
via_sara,4,A,BSCI106,"I thought that Via's class was extremely adequate, but that she was a good lecturer. Her power points (posted online) had everything you needed for the tests, and there is a lot of extra credit. The homeworks helped with comprehension of course material, and she makes herself available to help students who need it. She posts many many things to study from. I feel like I didn't learn very much in this class (except for the last part of domains and classes), but it was fairly easy to get a good grade because she was good at presenting material. Also, her old tests are almost exactly the same as her current. ",533
via_sara,3,A-,BSCI106H,"She is an okay lecturer. She covers the material and knows her stuff, but I understand how people can find her to be somewhat rude. Her exams are not  terribly difficult and she does not curve, so you'll have to actually study some. The notes that she posts online are pretty much her entire lecture so you're not missing too much if you miss a few lectures. She does drop one exam which helps. 
One problem that I have with her as a professor though is that she has a few lectures which really do not give any useful information towards the course. For example, when we began to discuss evoltuion, she spent an entire class discussing religion vs evolution. Also, after the last exam (before the final) she discusses lots of sustainability issues and inputs her own ideologies into her lectures, which i found unnecessary. Overall though, I think she's a decent professor and it is quite easy to get an A. She also gives a lot of extra credit oppurtunities. 
As for the lab part, in honors you have to do 2 full lab reports, and don't have to do the weekly quizzes, which I found to be useful. The TAs (at least mine) do not really tell you how to write the reports so previous knowledge in writing lab reports would be useful for this class.",533
via_sara,5,,BSCI106H,"Professor Via was a great teacher in my opinion. An entertaining lecturer, always has great examples, very fair tests, and no clicker questions. She gives over 30 points extra credit throughout the course, and holds review sessions before tests.

I would definitely recommend her!!",533

She has occasional homework assignments but they are extremely brief and take 10 minutes to do. She also gives out several extra credit assignments which is really nice. Don't be intimidated by her, it's not a difficult course and the material is easy to learn.  If you study for the exams you'll be fine and definitely get an A without putting forth too much effort.",533

via_sara,3,A+,BSCI106S,"A lot of people bash on Dr. Via, but I don't think she deserves it.  If you study a day or two in advance for her tests, you'll do fine.  The lab is easy and she gives around 40 points of extra credit.  The things she does in class are actually kind of funny - don't take her too seriously.  She's very opinionated, you'll see it when she starts talking about evolution and religion.  Go to the review sessions and stay after and talk to her.  She says she gets to know a few students this way and it could end up helping you.

Find her past exams and study them, they will be 60% of the current exam.  Don't read the textbook.  At all.  All of her tests are based on her lectures.  Take good notes and study from her outlines.  Actually read the lab manual for the prelab quizzes, it'll help you study for the lecture exams.",533

The material doesn't seem that bad, and she makes the tests seem like they're no big deal, but that's not really true.  I did pretty badly on all of the exams, but you do get to drop the lowest exam and quiz grade, and lab will boost your grade as well.  I did like that she held study sessions pretty often and offered extra credit, but she is very hard to approach and can come off very condescending and rude.  Overall, I did learn, and could probably do a lot better in the class knowing what I do now. ",533

She's a bit quirky but hey whatever it takes to keep you awake. The only advice I have is GO TO LECTURE- her exams are based of what SHE goes into great detail about, not the book. Also, do the extra credit, not only does it boost your grade but it honestly helps you do better on the exams.",533

However, this class isn't as impossible as everyone makes it seem. She posts study questions before tests, and if you do them and study the answers, you'll be fine (as she tends to put in a couple of questions pretty much there). 

It is a hard class, and you'll have to study at least 3 days in advance. Just know her outlines and study questions and pay attention in class.

I'll start with the downsides of this class:
I'll be honest. Yes, Dr. Via is a bit hard to approach, but when you do get the chance to talk to her, she's not that bad of a person.

Her class is hard-I'll give you that. Her exams are almost impossible (unless you have access to old exams) so find someone who has taken her class and study from their past exams...it helps a LOT.

She also expects you to know and memorize minute details. (That can get kinda annoying and frustrating) WHO CARES ABOUT THE STUPID BEE DANCE?! (Memorize that. Seriously. It has shown up on all her past exams)

Upsides of this class:
You learn a LOT--more than you possibly ever wanna know.

She's pretty organized with her lectures and she always posts her lectures online so you can print them out and make notes on them during her lecture (THIS HELPS A LOT)

Bottom line is: You're in for a challenge. Don't be lazy. Study hard and ask questions.",533
via_sara,1,B-,BSCI106,"Dr. Via is no good! Considering this is ONLY an intro course, she expects too much from her students. 

First off, she goes into excessive detail on the lecture outlines. There is just too much stuff and it's all presented very quickly. She spends half a second on each bullet point and maintains that frenetic pace for the entire lecture. If you ask for clarification, half the time she will pretend not to hear/understand you. Then, when you try to go over the outlines on your own time, you find that they are impossible to decipher because everything is phrased so weird.

Second, everything under the sun seems to be fair game for the exams. If you don't memorize every little detail from the lecture notes, expect points off. Via also has a tendency to stick random textbook questions on there just for kicks.

The one good thing about this course is the amount of leeway that is given in terms of grading. You get to drop your lowest exam and your lowest lab quiz, and there are bonus point questions which can give your grade a significant boost if you do all of 'em.

There are also a lot of indirect grade boosters such as the lab quizzes (easy 100 points) and study questions (easy 40 points). 

I bombed the first exam (E) and did fine on the second one (high B). Didn't even bother taking the third one. Now it's the week before finals and I've got an 88%. Unfortunately, my chances of walking away with an A are nonexistent, so I'm just going to wing the final and take a low B.",533
via_sara,1,,BSCI106S,"Dr.Via is one of the worst teachers imaginable. If you want to keep your sanity, do not take her class. She not only is a horrible teacher, but she is also rude, inconsiderate, and ill-mannered towards her students.
Her exams are UNREASONABLE!!! She expects you to memorize the exact wording of the lectures and if you know the answer but don't put it in her exact wording, it is wrong. So, it is entirely possible that you can study a lot and know all the material and still fail the exams.

Bottom Line: Don't get Via, if you have to move around all your classes or get inconvienient times, just do it.",533
via_sara,3,B+,BSCI106,"Mixed feelings about this course. Via knows what shes talking about (most of the time - but couldn't explain C and N cycles in an exam review). She has very important messages about climate change, habitat destruction, and mountain top coal removal, all things i care about a great deal, but the way she prevents her knowledge about the subjects is very bullyish and abrasive.

Plus side is - hardly studied and I got a B+ after 70's on all three exams. It kills me because if I had studied a little more I could have gotten an A.

Via is survivable and okay - but take another professor if you can.",533
via_sara,3,A,BSCI106H,"Ok this class is not that bad despite some of these reviews! You don't even have to read the book once!! If you just study her lecture outlines, which are posted online, you will be fine for her exams. Also her clicker points this semester were easy points, we got all of the points just by being there and clicking in an answer, even if it was wrong. A lot of people got 90/90 points for that. Also there's lots of opportunity for extra credit and a test is dropped. Worst thing about this class is that she doesn't really curve. Plus BSCI106 is boring and a pain no matter who you take. ",533
via_sara,2,,BSCI106,"Uninteresting, crazy and weird. I did not enjoy her class. It was beyond boring...Her exams were so pointless. The types of questions she asks sometimes you can't figure out how to answer them because of the wording. She also uses the ever-so-deadly multiple multiple questions which are also worded weird. The book isn't really needed. Uses way too many examples and you won't know which one will show up on the exams...Sorry if you get her. ",533
via_sara,1,,BSCI106,"DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.
i read the reviews for her before i took it but i figured that she couldn’t be all that bad. she was.

this was the hardest class i took all semester - i studied for over 18 hours straight for the final and i still think i did awful.

1. she posts outlines online which are sometimes helpful, but most of the time are just missing WAY too many words and have weird fill in the blanks.
2. she gives tons of examples in class that she expects you to remember verbatim on the tests (but she gets mad if you use her examples in study questions...)
3. MULTIPLE MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS ARE THE WORST THING EVER
4. she's an okay lecturer but is pretty rude to people asking questions and is REALLY tricky and mean about her clicker (attendance) points
5. she gives extra credit which is a plus.. maybe about 20 pts total for a semester of 600+ pts
6. lab was alright, i loved my TA which helped. we went over a lot of what was done in lecture, which (surprise surprise) was the stuff i actually learned rather than just memorizing.
7. when you get near the end of the class, for the 3rd exam, she expects you to memorize random phylums and pull examples out of her confusing confusing outlines

wow really long review. but just DONT take this class period, even if you have to move around other classes to take it. i studied my butt off and im still getting probably a C",533
via_sara,2,B,BSCI106,"Via has the most boring and horrible lectures. She uses clicker questions against you, (asking extra clicker questions if she sees students leaving after a clicker). She will call you out during a lecture if she catches you leaving the class early. She is the most pretentious and RUDE woman I have ever met. You must study a lot in order to do well in this course. It is not only about reading the book or going to lectures, her exams are all about actually understanding the concepts and analyzing it. 

STAY AWAY FROM HER CLASSES!

she has multiple-multiple choice questions... wtf?!?!",533
via_sara,1,B?,BSCI106,"She's horrible.  Her outlines are online and since she ""forgot"" to upload some of our clicker points (I had earned well over what I ended with) there is really no reason to go to class and listen to her drone.  Especially since half the time she can't even decipher her own slides or really doesn't seem like she knows what she's saying.  Entirely too many statements started with ""So I was learning about this last week...""

Like everyone before said, the exams are awful.  If you do take her, make sure you remember every example she gives in lecture because it's fair game on the exam. The exams require you to have memorized and know evvvvvverything backwards and forwards, with averages usually in the low 70s.

Condescending is the understatement of the century. The only bright side is that she does offer some extra credit.

My roommate takes BSCI106 with Jensen and loves it.  Individual exams are even curved in that class.",533
via_sara,1,c?,BSCI106,"Don't listen to all the enthusiasm about Dr. Sara Via: nice interesting and helpful. She is the rudest human being I have ever met. She is so disrespectful, taunting students during class and threatening them with studying for her impossible exams. Her lectures are more like a performance, in which she obsesses and humiliates herself repeatedly.

STAY AWAY STAY AWAY STAY AWAY.",533
via_sara,1,B,BSCI106,AVOID THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU CAN. I never knew someone so pretentious. Her lectures are very unorganized and sometimes I wondered if she even knew what she was talking about. I once made the mistake of emailing a possible mistake she might have made in lecture about DNA and she replied that she doesn't know much about it and made a guess as to why she is right.  Her tests are unbelievable. Its not enough for you to know the material but to be able analyze it like it was an question in English class. She also likes harping about how evolution disproves the creationism a little to much. ,533
via_sara,3,,BSCI106,"Ok so I'm not reviewing this prof, I just wanted to tell you all that if you buy the international edition of the Scott Freeman book you could pay about $45 from bookholders instead of $170 from ubc. It's the EXACT same thing, same # of pages with same print and pics on them.",533
via_sara,2,,BSCI106H,"I hated her class. Yes, she was a good lecturer, but her tests were impossible and she was very condescending and almost ignorant. Her tests are formatted so there can be multiple correct answers on her multiple choice (commonly known at UMCP as ""multiple-multiple choice questions""). Her lectures never really followed the textbook, which can be frustrating if you want to clarify a point she made in class. She also hates it if you use laptops during lectures, even if the students use it to type lecture notes. So, if you want to get all the notes down, I suggest you speed up your note-taking skills or bring a voice recorder.",533
via_sara,2,C,BSCI106,"I really liked Dr. Via as a person and as a lecturer. But what really killed me about her was her impossible tests. They're seriously impossible. She does this multiple/multiple choice where more than one answer can be correct, all of them can be correct, or none of them can be correct. It's so confusing! 
I hated the class because I have absolutely no interest in studying phylogeny of plants/algae. ",533
via_sara,1,,BSCI106H,"She is not very nice and very condescending.  She seems to think that she's like the smartest person ever and that all the students are stupid little children.  She repeatedly lectures the people who actually attend class that if they skip class they will fail.  It's like, why is she lecturing the people who are actually there about not being there!?  Also, her lectures are really unorganized and hard to understand, and she focuses on details that are really not that essential to understanding ecology and evolution, while skipping over topics that are ACTUALLY important.
Also, she is an environmental fanatic who seems to think that doomsday is coming any time now and she makes up ""facts"" such as ""rainforest economics"" that don't make any sense (especially if you already known something about REAL economics).",533
via_sara,4,,BSCI106,"I had more fun in bsci106 than in any other class that semester. Via made things interesting, easy to understand, and her tests are straightforward. Definitely utilize other materials, like the book, and MasteringBio if you want a good grade in this course, but even if you don't, it's not that hard to do well on tests. She will let her political opinions be known, however, so if you are bothered by liberal viewpoints, she may not be the best choice for you.  ",533
via_sara,1,,BSCI106,She is evil.  She hates when people walk into class late.  Many of the things that she states when she is teaching are false and she is a terrible professor.,533
via_sara,4,A,BSCI106H,"I love Dr. Via! She is a pretty nice person and is helpful. At times she does seem annoyed, but overall she is still a good teacher.. And she will interact with you pleasantly if she recognizes you are truly interested (sit in the front, stay awake, talk to her after class about lecture).

Via's tests have been multiple-multiple choice, and they are pretty good because you can have a chance to get some points even if you dont know all of the answers. My best advice is to form a study group. I did, and the results were great, if you can teach it yourself, you'll know it on the test! The tests aren't bad at all, and she drops the lowest one, and drops 2 online quizzes.

Her lecture outlines are good, despite what everyone says. They have some minor mistakes on them, but they're not unusable. The best way to make use of them is to COME TO LECTURE and annotate the outlines with extra things she says in lecture, it helps, I got an A doing it. And always come back to the outlines when studying, especially with phylogeny, because you are expected to know it well.

Give Via a chance, she's a respectable prof.",533
via_sara,1,C,BSCI106,"Via is only good at research and nothing else. Her weekly quizzes are extremely confusing. her multiple multiple choice is just intimidating. doesn't respect students and regardless of the fact that you study, you still going to get an average score on the exam unless you are Isaac Newton.

via_sara,2,,BSCI106C,"I only liked her for the first lecture, and from there my opinion of her plummeted. She reads directly from her lecture notes so there is no point in going to class. I got an A in the course and skipped a good 2/3 of the classes once I figured out there was no point in going. The material isn't too hard and she tests you right from the lecture outline in addition to holding review sessions, though I never went. She also posts study questions with the answers, so it IS helpful in studying for the exams. The quizzes she gives are badly worded and it was hard to pick out an approriate answer. She didn't like you to ask her questions and like the others said, spent way to much time campaigning to save the rainforest. Aside from her boring lectures and lack of teaching skills, I didn't find the course too diffucult. ",533
via_sara,1,A,BSCI106C,This woman is perhaps the WORST biology professor I have ever encountered. She makes it very clear in the beginning of the course that she should be our last resort for help.She skipped important material in lecture to cover instead reasons that we should recycle and ways to save the rainforest. One lecture on that would have been enough but she managed to lecture about it for more than two weeks. She skipped human evolution even though it was still covered on the exam . The projector stopped working during the phylogeny lecture and although she didnt cover the material we were still expected to know ALL of the material for the exam. Dont even bother going to the last lecture on case studies because it is a pure waste of time as she goes through 50 min of the different organizations that are trying to save the rain forest. ,533
via_sara,1,C,BSCI106,"I came to BSCI 106 with such enthusiasm and ready to work and give it all i got. Hoping for a good professor, unfortunately i got Via. She is very disorganized and could care less about her students. Her tests are practically undoable. I would not recommond her to BSCI 106, and avoid her at all costs.",533
via_sara,1,A,BSCI106,"I'll second the contention that Dr. Via is extremely pretentious and pedantic does not even begin to cover the adjectives I could use. She assigns weekly quizes that  once was due the night before a midterm. I am honestly blown away by what this woman considers rational in the assessment department (far too much: one quiz per week, 3 exams, two major homework assignments a major scientific paper 10-12 pages, a lab practical, and expects us to be able among our other course obligations) given her whirlwind lectures darting from one set of minutia to the next and often not in synch with lecture outlines. I never missed one solitary lecture, but very frequently she would berate the class on the poor attendance (to those who were conscientiously attending mind you)and it would seem as far as my personal opinion that she often tried constructing the quizes in such a manner as to ""trick"" those who didn't attend... I'll let you deduce the problem with that logic. I feel she aims to punish rather than teach and her mammoth impetuous ego and not the teaching ability to back it up is exactly why this is the worst professor I've had in my 80+ accrued credit hours at a current 4.0 G.P.A. I also agree with those who mentioned her disorganization and skipping of important concepts of ecology and evolution.  ",533
via_sara,1,,BSCI106H,"I wouldn't recommend that anyone take Dr. Via's class if it can be avoided. She is not very receptive of students' questions, sometimes treating questions with frustration or acting like the student was stupid for asking. She doesn't do a good job explaining the material covered in BSCI106, just rushes through powerpoints that don't make a whole lot of sense. She spends a lot of time on less important things and little time on the topics students have difficulty understanding. She has quickly lost the respect of many of the students.",533

On midterms and final I got in the 70s, but I went to every discussion where there are always graded assignments....",538
penniston-dorland,4,,GEOL120,"This was a good non-lab science class and proved interesting as well. Professor P-D is a clear, effective teacher and she is very approachable if you need help. 

Assignments included 3 tests over the course of term that were based entirely on her lectures, you didn't have to bother with the book except for one discussion assignment, and a final exam. She dropped one of the midterm tests. There were busy work assignments weekly for discussion and an environmental resume assignment, too, but it was easy to do well on. 

You do have to come to class, she does participation points, but if you show up and care at all, you should do well. She's easy to understand. ",538

Occasionally makes jokes in light hearted and subtle manners. handsome likeable fair dude overall.",539
juntti,5,A,BSCI440,"Great guy in general. Speaks very gently and very clearly. Gets straight to the point, speaks chronologically and logically.

preston,4,A,STAT400,"He's kind of a cutie professor, like smart-white-middle age-dad type. His lectures were fine if you could follow (I could but most people couldnt) but he posts the notes online. Or you can just learn from the textbook because tbh he would explain like reasoning behind some of the formulas during lecture and thats just useless. Exams are very fair, he gave a practice test, and theres quizzes every friday. Also he does graded HW on R but also gives you a sheet on how to do the problems. pretty good class overall!

HE ALSO DOESNT DO MINUS GRADES! AN A IS 90-97! A+ is 97-100 and so on. he might change this by next semester tho because he just moved here and maybe doesn't realize that Maryland gives +/- grades.",540

preston,4,A,STAT400,"Had him over Spring 2019 actually and he was very nice with the transition. He is very understanding IMO, and every time I approached him in person he was always friendly. He made a whole website for the class with all the resources on it and I felt that was very nice of him.

However, I stopped going to lectures because they were very boring and I didn't really learn much in there, but I think that might just be more of a stat400 problem than his problem.

I also remember exams and quizzes were pretty straight forward and weren't like gotcha questions",540
preston,4,C+,STAT410,"I will preface this with that my mental health was not great during the semester, but that improved as the semester hit the end.

Dr. Preston is an extremely nice professor and wants to make sure you learn the material. He is a bit of a ""tough dad"" type, but in the end you can tell he does care. His exams are a bit long (and I'm usually a fast test taker), but he curves accordingly. My #1 advice would be go to his office hours and take an interest in learning the material, you won't regret it. 

Don't cheat though, he will definitely turn your world upside down if he finds out. ",540
sukharev,3,A,BSCI440,"Pros:
-Reuses old exam questions. Get some from your friends and buy the purple book for $10 at the book store.
-Explanations of concepts were not bad though. Teacher engaging with good sense of humor. Heavy Russian accent and very noticeable stutter. 
-Teacher receptive to student concerns and flexible. Available during office hours
-Usually gives you back points on exams if you argue for it

Cons:
-Slides are disorganized. Titles on first slide should be continued throughout presentation to divide the slides up. 
-Little context given for material. We all felt like large  volumes of information were being explained and tossed at students without good context to memorize them.
-Teacher arrived late, started class late, and ended class late, which was inappropriate and not good for students who had a class afterwards.
-Reviews for exams were disjointed. Consisted of professor speeding through slides and realizing that it was a lot of material unfairly given to us. There should have been a better emphasis on big picture and better organization.
-Many errors in answer keys and poorly designed, reused questions. Always had to get points back for every single exam. Disaster.",541
sukharev,3,A,BSCI440,"Extremely knowledgable profesor but not a good instructor. You will get used to his ""uh's and um's"" but you will not get used to his lecture style. His transitions between slides are poor and the way he presents the material is not ideal. Literally, all the TA's told me that they do not understand how we are learning from this guy because of the way he teaches.
He is a very nice person though and if you go to his office hours, he will make sure you understand the material. And like the reviews below, yes, Dr. Sukharev does re-use questions from old exams. He re-used a lot of them for the second and third exam. They were pretty much identical actually so if you have old exams, you will get an A.

The final exam was incredibly difficult. I pulled an all nighter studying for the final and I guessed on approximately 70%  of it. luckily, the exam was out of 200 points but had 230 possible points. He also does not do the +/- system so you have to aim for that 90%.

Overall, if you want an A on your transcript for BSCI440 then take Sukharev. If you actually want to learn the material and be prepared for medical school/MCATS, then take Singer.",541
sukharev,4,B,BSCI440,"Solid professor. You learn soooooo much information and it's really cool to be able to apply it in real life situations. He doesn't curve at the end. But there are built-in curves with his exams. There are 4 exams (3 mid-terms and 1 final). Each are 200 points (so total of 800 points in lecture). With each exam, he gives extra buffer points (i.e. for the final, he only counts it out of 200 but there was a total of 253 points!!!! which helped soooooo much in boosting my grade). Discussion is 200 points (based on an individual 20 minute presentation, 4 quizzes, attendance, and participation). So there are a total of 1000 points. No curve. So 900 is an A, 800 is a B, 700 is a C. He doesn't do plus/minus either.  Super, super, SUPER generous with regrades (but make sure you use pen!). Basically look at the answer key he posts outside his office and then go to his office hours and explain why you think you should get more points, and he is super generous with giving back points. He doesn't regrade the entire exam like most professors, but only looks at the questions you ask him which is super nice. This was definitely one of my favorite classes at UMD (the other one being BSCI330 with Dr. Ades). ",541
sukharev,4,A,BSCI440,"This class is no joke. I spent sooo many hours studying for it, and in the end it was worth it. The material is interesting beyond belief and is incredibly relevant for premedical students. It is the sheer magnitude of material that makes it difficult to wrap your head around, but if you are diligent and keep up with lecture it isn’t too bad. The material itself is not hard to understand, it’s merely the ordeal of memorizing it is what makes the class hard.

Sukharev isn’t the best lecturer but his exams are fair and he is very generous with giving back points if you see him after an exam (do try to have a valid argument for why you should get points back though, nobody likes the kid who just wants points back because he just thinks he deserves them, and he’ll call you out for it). Sukharev is straightforward in his exams, which are very memorization-oriented, unlike Higgins and Singer, who are more application/case study based.

Sukharev likes details and will ask you to recall things like the pressure value of the valves going in and out of the heart. He also doesn’t give out +/-‘s for final grades. He will give out extra points on exams so it is possible to get over 100%.

Go to discussion, I got lucky and had a ballin TA (yay Amol!) and you can usually get freebie points in discussion for showing up and giving a decent presentation. Quizzes in discussion are also given, which are harder than exam material but my year the last two quizzes were allowed to be taken in groups.

This class is a ton of work though; be aware when going in that this class will and should take up most of your time during the semester. Khan academy helps tremendously, but keeping up with (and attending) lecture will take you a long way.",541
sukharev,5,A,BSCI440,"Honestly one of the best professors at UMD. He is very receptive, extremely fair and understanding. Lectures are great and he does a great job of keeping everyone's attention. Go to office hours and use the purple manual. ever exam has a built in curve so they don't curve the class at the end. he also doesn't do +/- grading so be mindful of this. his exams are straight from his slides and the things he says in lecture - so go to class! very generous with extra credit on the final - i pulled up my grade by 4% just because of the final and got an A in the class. prof sukharev is the bomb! take bsci440 with him!",541
sukharev,5,,BSCI440,"One of the most receptive professors I have met at this university. Unlike with other teachers I've had I felt as though he cared about his students and really just wanted them to learn the material. It can be kind of intimidating to speak with professors, but he is always willing to meet with you.

The class is by no means easy, there is a lot of material to cover and you will be asked about everything. But there are no tricks and Dr. Sukharev is very open to discussing mistakes made and giving points back when deserved.",541
sukharev,5,,BSCI440,"I really enjoyed having Dr. Sukharev. He's a really great lecturer and even manages to get a few chuckles in the middle of a class filled with tense students trying to copy down everything he says! I can't believe he covered all that information in one semester. 

He's very fast paced but is very responsive to students. So don't hesitate to ask a question during or after class, no matter how hurried he seems, he'll take the time to answer. He may not smile much but he's very fair and has a very good sense of humor. Plus he cares, he's not one of those professors who would just give you the basic facts, he wants you to understand why (even the circuits part of neuron excitation. I loved that part of his teaching style though. As a student who can't memorize, I think that helped a lot for me.  

You can also tell that he really cares about his students learning, which is always a fantastic thing to have in any professor. He uses lecture slides with summary topics he makes himself, when he could've saved himself the trouble and just gotten them from the book. But that means it's reciprocal as well. If he took the time to make the slide, you should take the time to appreciate and learn it! Plus its pretty much certain that the subject is going to be on the exam in one way or another. 

Did I mention that he doesn't like to ""dumb it down"" too much? Its something that is really important in a processor, that means he's not given up on our learning capacity (yet)! A sign that he truly respects his students and would rather see them try than give up and hand out free points. Of course, this means I didn't do as well as I would have liked on my first exam (too much memorization for me) but I saw myself improving through my efforts in the class, which is pretty rewarding really.  

If you want to learn physiology, you should definitely take 440 with Dr. S!!",541
sukharev,4,A,BSCI440,"Dr. Sukharev is a good professor - don't be scared off by his accent at the beginning of the semester.  Focus on his notes and past exams rather than the book. Take good notes, as his slides are mostly just pictures and he will explain the important concepts verbally.  There is a lot of memorization (esp. the receptors, circulatory system responses, etc) but just use the study aids provided by the TAs to help you memorize.

sukharev,5,A,BSCI440,"Professor Sukharev is an extremely engaging and straightforward teacher. He is adorable and makes jokes during lecture to keep the class entertained. 

He stutters sometimes but always gets the point across clearly. His exams are difficult but doable if you study exactly what he tells you to.

Extremely willing to talk to you and is fair with regrades. Highly recommend!!",541
jabeen,2,A,HONR268N,"Was super excited to take honors seminar about particle physics and programming. Ended up being extremely confused about equations, Linux, and the concepts. Lecture could have been executed much better. In fairness, I think she was teaching it like an upper level science course (there was no hand-holding and her instructions are super vague), but I wish someone told me I was supposed to look for resources outside of what she gave us. I figured out how to deal with this class eventually and I DO think it helped me get accustomed to scientific reading, but it could be done in a much gentler way, without letting me down for the course content.... I guess an auto-A seminar is the best way to do this, but it was still disappointing....
Regarding the content, I do not recommend STEM honors seminars. Everyone in this class was at totally different levels for physics and programming, so you will either be bored or extremely frustrated.",543
jabeen,4,A+,HONR268N,"The seminar was very difficult in terms of understanding the material. In the end, I ended up learning a lot about particle physics, but I felt like I was drowning the entire semester. Overall, it's a class worth taking.",543
jabeen,5,A+,HONR269L,"Very accommodating. The class is very loose, and if you can consistently get work done in a timely fashion, it'll be a breeze. Easier than HONR268N (it's a 2 semester sequence).",543
bhattacharyya,1,,ENEE150,Snore.......,544
bhattacharyya,1,,ENEE150,"He doesn't know how to teach. His lectures are extremely boring so don't even bother going to class. He is the only one who teaches ENEE150 though, so you're stuck with him if you take this course. He's not hard, just boring and incompetent. ",544
bhattacharyya,1,A,ENEE150,"Make no mistake, it is not difficult to get a good grade in this class, however, be prepared to learn absolutely nothing. The course description on the EE website does not match up at all with what is actually taught in the class. The first half of the class is spent sitting through the dullest most dubious lectures you will ever suffer through on vim and unix syntax. (not programming) about half way through when something about programming is taught it is presented in such a way that it seems like it is coming straight from a textbook. It tends to be about as cryptic as anyone could possibly make a lecture. Part of this is simply the C programming language, but the way in which it is presented could be much better. I have had the fortune to have already taken many programming classes (in Java mostly) so I am at least a bit more familiar with the content of the course which barely makes it beyond the remedial mark. This is a very new class so I am quite sure that the content will change at least slightly over the coming semesters, but it does not change the fact that Bhattacharyya is a less than stellar professor that is difficult to understand. The projects, while not difficult have at least three places you have to go to get information on how to go about doing it, and no where is there a complete set of instructions. Some information is given in e-mails, some in power points online, some in other project descriptions on line, and finally, some in the .h file gotten via glue. It is as if he tries to make it more difficult to find the information. 

This is a required class for EE majors, and there are a small number of professors teaching this class so chances are you will be stuck with this guy, so good luck (its going to suck)",544
bhattacharyya,3,A,ENEE150,"Shuvra is a very fair teacher. His tests usually take the whole time, but they are more than manageable if you just look over the material. Also, he will give extensions on projects if he sees many students are struggling with them. This happened 2 times in my class when we were all a little lost on certain parts of the projects and he extended the due dates by about half a week in each case which really helped.

Shuvra is also a very annoying teacher though. He is a nice guy, but his teaching methods are all so tedious and dull that you will most certainly find yourself hating the projects and not paying attention a lot of the time in class. For each project you will have to write enormous amounts of automated tests for your code. These tests will sometimes be utterly useless, but you still have to take the ~15 minutes to make each one. This adds up to hours of complete boredom and busywork when you are required to make about 40 tests on the final project. Also, his lectures are very dull. He makes powerpoints the way everyone tells you not to make them by putting whole paragraphs on each slide. He will spend at least 20 minutes on each slide no matter how easy the material on it is. Furthermore, this causes him to never finish a lecture and you will leave this course feeling like you could have learned a lot more.
Overall, this course is pretty easy and the actual coding of the projects is interesting. However, the lectures are boring, the automated tests are a pain to do, and we could have learned a lot more in the given time.",544
doboszczak,5,,AMSC460,"In my opinion, Stefan is one of the best math professor's at UMD. His lecture's are clear and easy to follow, and he teaches with a lot of personality, making the lectures more fun to attend. He assigned homework once a week, but was very flexible if we needed an extra day or two to complete it. If you go to class and complete the homework you can do very well in the class. I HIGHLY recommend taking him for any class if you get the chance. ",547

doboszczak,5,A,MATH120,Lectures can be a bit boring but he does a good job in explaining concepts and answering questions. There are a lot of homework assignment due (at least 2/week) but he drops 8 of them. The discussion worksheets are group work and he also drops the lowest 4 worksheets.,547

doboszczak,5,A-,MATH141,"I had him for online this semester

doboszczak,5,A,MATH141,"I felt so lucky to have Stefan for 141. He is straightforward in his lectures and explains concepts pretty well. Best of all, he doesn't throw any curveballs on his exams! If you attend his lectures, go to your discussion section, and do the WebAssign homeworks, everything on his tests will look familiar. I actually found the exams significantly easier than the homework. Best of all, he's a really nice guy and brings a bit of humor to his lectures at times.

Don't settle for a lesser professor, take Stefan!

doboszczak,5,B,MATH241,Honestly one of the kindest professors I’ve had at UMD. I wasn’t a fan of Justin as a math professor but Stefan really set the bar high! We writes notes during class and later uploads them + a video. Office hours are helpful too and exams are fair. ,547
doboszczak,4,C,MATH240,"Stefan is a pretty good teacher. I think his exams were also well-designed. Never any trick questions. If you did the homework, you can go into the exams fairly confident. And there were no quizzes in discussion sections or anything, so you can safely skip them. The only thing that bugged me a bit is that he switched from synchronous to asynchronous lectures a week into the semester. I prefer synchronous lectures, but it's not that big a deal because Stefan was active on Piazza, so you could still get questions answered there.",547
anlage,5,A,PHYS410,"In the interest of full disclosure I am now working for Professor Anlage. That said I took his class before I started working for him and I really liked the class, which is odd for a 400 level physics class.

Unlike many (or most) physics teachers, Professor Anlage actually gave a reasonable amount of work. I was pretty much always able to finish the entire homework assignments within a few hours of when I started. Also, he gave one extra credit problem per homework and they were often not difficult.

In addition, all of his tests seemed to have a reasonable degree of difficulty. I think all the test problems were fairly interesting and not overly difficult. I think the averages were like 80, 72, and 70 for the 2 midterms and final respectively (my previous physics class had been with Professor Gates and the first test had the cutoff for a B as a 30%). 

I don't know how much he ended up curving the class but upon checking the grade distribution, I saw that only 2 people in the class got below a C and about 2/3 of the class got A's and B's which seems like a good distribution. 

That said I didn't think the lectures were overly interesting. One thing I have noticed is that as you get further along in Physics, the Physics becomes more and more abstract. So you really didn't come out of lectures feeling as though you learned anything real. I generally felt that I could solve a problem easily enough, but that problem would probably not have a strong basis in reality. 

However, one of the best things about Professor Anlage is that he always stayed after class for however long people were there to ask questions. There were several times where I stayed to ask something for over half an hour and he never seemed like he was rushed (unless another class started entering).

Tl; dr: Take 410 with him because you will almost definitely pass and you will have a thorough understanding of the material although you may feel as though the material is irrelevant.",548
anlage,5,A,PHYS375,"Professor Anlage is excellent. Really helps you out when things are going wrong in the lab, and is very patient about it too. He is a good lecturer - explains things well and answers any questions you can have. Definitely recommend him.",548
anlage,5,A,PHYS375,"I've had Dr. Anlage for two classes now, 375 and 402. He's the man. Real cheerful, and does a great job teaching the material. You might want to think about looking ahead in the book before going to lecture though, because he tends to move pretty quickly.",548
anlage,5,A,PHYS402,"I'd heard a lot of really bad things about Anlage before taking the class, and was really nervous.  However, he's actually a great physics professor.  His weekly homeworks force you to learn the material, and learn it well, and his tests were a good level of challenge without being incomprehensible.  He offered extra office hours to those who needed them, which I heard were very helpful.  He can go fast and sometimes explanations aren't the best, but the text fills in any blanks quite nicely.  ",548
anlage,5,,PHYS371,"Anlage was great! Very approachable and kind guy, shared stories about his travels and his family to us but it never got in the way of course material. Had a lot of fun with the class, the only downside is that his quizzes were a bit weird and in my opinion unfair at times, but that's just how online classes are. ",548
anlage,5,A-,PHYS371,"Anlage was a really great professor. The class is hard but definitely fair. His exams really test whether you understand the material or not. 
He did a really good job of teaching online! I was always engaged with his class and he is clearly passionate about the topics he teaches. The quizzes were hard but fair, the only downside was that most of the time it was 1 multiple choice question, so you either got a 0/10 or a 10/10, no in-between. The homework is fine if you work through it with a study group. ",548
kaushal,3,B+,GEOL120,"Really nice guy but very quiet and very boring, which can be good or bad. He puts all of his lecture slides online so you don't have to take notes, nonetheless pay attention. Discussion quizzes are easy and the overall work is easy and not hard to understand.",549

mazzullo,4,B+,STAT100,"Probably the nicest lady I've ever met. That being said, she can't really lecture properly. We probably started class late everyday because she was gathering her things. Material is easy, just a lot of busy online work. The discussions aren't mandatory, and the TA's honestly don't even know what's going on in class. She drops a lot of stuff, and we probably had 15-20 extra credit opportunities, so that's nice. Take her if you want an easy B, but be warned that you might have to self teach yourself a lot.",551
mazzullo,5,A,STAT400,"Super nice, great professor.
There are three easy exams and a final, and a few quizzes. Since the quizzes aren't every week, a lot of people wouldn't show up to discussion. We are allowed to bring a sheet of notes into the exam, and she also let us do test corrections on the first and second exam (for 1/2 points back on the first and 1/4 points back on the second).
She must have canceled lectures at least 8 times over the semester for personal things that came up for her. When that happened, she would post a video quiz which was super easy, and you could retake it as many times as you wanted.",551
mazzullo,5,A,STAT400,TAKE FOR STAT400 - She's a great professor and she goes over every  topic thoroughly. Lectures can be a little slow but thats better than them being fast. SO much extra credit ,551
mazzullo,5,,STAT100,"She was one of the nicest professors for my first semester at UMD. I have never been talented at math, but she enabled me to get an A+ in Stat100. Her review sheets are basically the same as the exam, so you’re definitely being prepared to do well. She is also lenient with deadlines of homeworks, and gave about 8 points of extra credit during the whole semester. She is very kind, but I notice that some students zone out during lecture, due to her rambling. She can ramble on, but she is just trying to give as much background and explanation as possible for these topics. I definitely recommend her for stat100 :) ",551
mazzullo,5,A,STAT430,"She is very kind and understanding, classwork is pretty chill for the most part...she now uses Zoom to conduct online lectures on Friday (as a way to practice coding in SAS), and uses Mondays and most Wednesdays (some Wednesdays we also have online lectures) for lectures. Her lectures are pretty dry though and the slides are very long, but she posts them on ELMS, so it has all the info you need.",551
mazzullo,5,A,STAT400,"Mrs. Mazzullo shows that she cares about her students and wants all of us to learn. First and foremost, she allowed for test corrections in each of the three midterms (1/2 points back for Midterm 1, 1/4 points back for Midterm 2, and 1 point back for Midterm 3). Moreover, whenever she can't lecture due to some things coming up, she would post a video lecture with an attached quiz. Since the quiz has unlimited attempts, they were an easy way to not only obtain free points but also learn the material better. I thoroughly enjoyed having her as my STAT400 instructor, and recommend anyone who has a chance of signing up for her classes to do so.",551
mazzullo,5,A,STAT401,"Mazzullo is the first prof I've had that I think about and smile. The first that I'll actually miss when I graduate, even though we aren't buds or anything. She's just extremely, extremely nice, and sharp as a tack too. Any class she teaches will be easy, she will teach it well, and you'll have lots of opportunities for flexibility. Plus, it's clear what you have to know, and she will teach you all you have to know.

mazzullo,4,A,STAT400,"Dr. Mazzullo is an extremely nice and caring professor who teaches the material in a straightforward, clear way.

saegusa,4,A,STAT420,He's a very quiet and calm professor. His exams are similar to HW problems and he curves assignments. Pretty chill.,552
saegusa,4,A,STAT420,"His exams are not very hard. However, I think he spends too much time covering review topics like convergence in distribution and convergence in probability, leaving us no time to cover other topics other than some basics.

I think if you want more comprehensive content you should take someone like J. Xu.",552
saegusa,5,A+,STAT401,Professor Saegusa is great. He teaches the content in an easily digestible manner and his exams are less nitpicky and more about overall concepts. Definitely recommend taking 401 with him. ,552
saegusa,2,D+,STAT420,"Was a fine lecturer, but STAT 420 is one those classes where it either clicked right away and you did really well, or it just never did and you'll end up doing consistently poorly despite spending hours and hours studying. Maybe I'm just salty because he mentioned at the beginning of class that he would curve all tests so that the average score was an 80, but didn't end up doing that (I would have gotten a C- if he had)",552
saegusa,3,A,,"I think he teaches well, but it's very boring at times. His exams are easy, and he spends an enormous amount of time doing review (like convergence in probability/distribution) and examples during lecture. Sometimes I found myself sleeping through ~50% of lecture and waking up with Saegusa still working on the same problem he started during the start of class. I think if you read the textbook, you can probably skip class. Make sure you do the homeworks, since the exams are the same questions with the numbers changed around. Recommend Jian Xu over him, if not for a (slightly) more engaging experience, going over more material",552
saegusa,3,,STAT420,"His teaching is okay in class. In office hours, he's really condescending and makes you feel stupid for asking him to re explain things from class.",552
saegusa,1,A,STAT420,"I've been on the fence between one and two stars for a while, but what pushed me over the edge was Professor Saegusa's inconsistent (and quite frankly, insensitive) homework spacing. Professor Saegusa is barely able to communicate any of the material, and when he does, it is often a proof irrelevant to the homework/tests or a theorem riddled with typos. Don't get me wrong, I like math, but I only want to see the underlying theorem if the professor is capable of communicating the material relevant to homework/tests in the remaining time, and he simply isn't.
His tests frequently came with a massive time crunch that left the entire class scoring poorly. Despite this, he only curved one of our exams. I am not salty about a poor grade, in fact I am doing well. Rather, this fits into a constant pattern of him being insensitive about the time we need to do things, be it taking or scanning a test, or going from spacing his homeworks once every three weeks to once a week. That last thing really got on my nerves: his homeworks tend to take 5-10 hours, and there were a few weeks where I did not budget time for them, only to find out Tuesday that we had a homework due Friday. This was incredibly inconsiderate of our time; if you want to go from giving homework once every three weeks to once a week, the students need more of a heads up. He isn't necessarily mean, just inconsiderate.
Essentially, if you decide to take Professor Saegusa, know that you will be teaching yourself much of the material, that he will assign homework inconsistently but frequently, that his tests are on a huge time crunch, and that his slides are riddled with typos. Do not recommend, though I know (sadly) that both of the STAT420 options aren't good ones.",552
kocher,4,,BSCI222,"Pretty straightforward class.  Go to class and read the textbook. Reading the textbook is a must to do well in his class! Be determined to do well on the 3 exams, that way you don't have to take the final exam (it's optional) and not stress over one additional final during finals week. Overall, straightforward class- exams are fair, go to discussion and do all the homework/quizzes/creative writing assignments, and you should come out with an A easily. ",555
kocher,4,A,BSCI222,"Kocher drops an exam, including the final, which is a big plus. I dropped the final but I heard it was really easy and a grade booster.
He's a really boring teacher and I stopped going to class after two weeks. I never went to class and read the book instead and did really well, so if youre okay with skipping lectures and just reading, take Kocher. His exams were pretty easy and straightforward. He doesn't really try to trick you. Although the average for our first midterm was pretty high so he did make the second one quite a bit harder. (But it still wasn't bad).
There are three writing assignments that are a part of your discussion grade. These are generally a grade booster and easy points. If you can have Claire O'Quin as your TA, you should take her. She's been his TA for years and knows what he likes to test on. ",555
kocher,4,A-,BSCI222,"Dr. Kocher is a nice, boring, and unenthusiastic professor who is pretty knowledgeable about genetics (obviously). His lectures are pretty dry (just goes straight through powerpoints which are posted online). The material isn't that difficult to grasp compared to other classes. The only annoying part about this class is the weekly discussions (2 hours each) where you discuss lecture material and take a 10 pt quiz (they drop your 2 lowest quizzes). The first few weeks they assigned homework from the book but eventually they stopped collecting it.

Course Structure:

3 midterms (100 pts each)---> Look at old exams!! He repeats a lot of the same questions!
1 final exam (optional if you are satisfied with your guaranteed grade based on your 3 midterms. 50 multiple choice, kinda difficult)
3 writing assignments (25 pts each, essentially a completion grade)

Despite his boring lectures, Dr. Kocher is very helpful when you ask questions. He is pretty straightforward and does not test you on super-complicated stuff. If it is complex, he will explain it thoroughly in lecture.  

Despite my semi-negative review about Kocher, I recommend taking him for genetics. His exams tend to be easier compared to other professors. Enjoy...",555
kocher,4,A,BSCI222,"If you've had a good amount of high school biology (especially IB or AP stuff), you're probably set and at least half the material will be review to you (mitosis and punnet squares AGAIN?!).

The other half of the material is a mix between interesting cellular topics and bland number-crunching, gene-estimating tedium. 

Dr. Kocher himself is not a bad guy. Lectures are pretty dry to the point where I stopped going a couple of weeks into the course. It's not a huge problem to not attend the class if you're lazy or looking to sleep in (like me) because he posts all the PowerPoint slides from class online. You can effectively learn all you need to know from them exclusively.

Exams are pretty tolerable. Often very similar to old exams. Go to the review session (or at least download the review sessions PowerPoint which, yes, is also online).

Lowest exam (including the final) is dropped so if you score well enough on the first 3, the final is optional. Grades are usually high enough so there's no curve-- take the final if you have a borderline grade. It's 50 multiple choice questions and not hard at all. 

The book doesn't help too much, so if you're on the fence about buying it, you can probably be set without it. The answer manual is pretty handy, though-- get that alone if you want to save some money and see how to do your homework problems.

Homework was collected for only the first two weeks in discussion. I don't even think it factored into the grade, but do it anyway. ",555
kocher,4,B+,BSCI222,"kocher is pretty boring and hard to learn from but his exams are really easy/ fair
he uses a lot of questions from previous exams
if you have a good TA you are good to go
Claire is the best TA
review sessions before exams are really helpful
you don't need to read every page of the chapter of the book just use the book to read over things that you are unclear about",555
kocher,4,A,BSCI222,"Professor Kocher is a really nice guy. If you memorize the major concepts, you should be fine, he doesn't test on specifics. Go to the reviews with Claire O'Quinn, she's a life saver. Grading of the essay on his exams are completely dependent on what they're looking for. I remember I wrote tons for one essay, but I lost maybe six or seven points because I didn't include the bullet points that he had on his slides. That's where memorization comes in.

He's awesome, but don't expect him to help you if you go to his office. His exams are already really general, so he's not going to tell you what's on it. Usually you can figure it out by what he says in lecture. Sometimes he blatantly tells you ""this will be on the exam, know how to do this.""

He isn't very engaging in lecture, so a lot of the time people don't go. Just remember that if you decide to do that, you'll miss out on the hints that he gives out. Claire usually covers those in her reviews, but those are a day before the exam and usually there isn't enough  time to study all the material you need to know.

Something I found very helpful was to have a google doc with a few of my buddies. We all took topics from his lectures and broke them down on the doc, exactly what we needed to know, and studied from there. If you can do that, and know how to do most of the problems from the book, you should be fine. 

A word of caution: Be careful what TA you get. They can make or break you. My TA was extremely nice, but her quizzes were nearly impossible. She was very knowledgable and helped us a lot, but the averages of her section compared to the rest of the class' was about .7% higher altogether, which wasn't worth the points we lost for discussion.

In conclusion, Kocher is the man, study the big concepts, slides > the book, read the book for the potential essay questions. Know how to draw DNA, how to draw various stages of meiosis, DNA mapping, punnet squares, chi squared tests, sex determination. Those are usually almost always on his exams.

Don't worry about the equations he gives you for genetic drift and mutation and stuff. We stressed out about that a lot and didn't know how to do the problems in the book, but they weren't even on the exam. 

I heard the final wasn't too bad, but fortunately I did well enough on the first three exams that I didn't have to take it. I hope this was helpful, good luck everyone :)",555
kocher,4,A-,BSCI222,"i got an A- in this class BARELY, and didnt have to take the final. but i also never paid attention in lecture, and only read the book religiously for the first exam (which is also the exam i did the worst on.) there's a learning curve in this class and you just need to figure out how he tests. 85% of the stuff presented in lecture and in the books will never show up on the exam...so dont stress about it. look at his past exams and 60% of it will be there again on your test presented exactly the same, or a slight variation.  then look at the homework questions and his slides to see what short answers and essays could possibly show up. very easy to figure out. GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS! they saved me, and i only went to the ones for test 2 and 3 (possibly again why my first test was the lowest)...the TA holding the review sessions will be your biggest help. seriously if i can get an A in this class simply from rigorous memorization three days before each exam, anyone can. he's your best bet. no one here has posted about the final and i cant either. but it is 50 mc and we saw the first page of the one from the year before....looks pretty easy if you feel like studying for it. so yeah thats about it. good luck! take kocher",555
kocher,4,B,BSCI222,"Dr. Kocher is a really great professor. I enjoyed his lectures and learned a lot about genetics. I liked the fact that he doesn't want students to memorize small details, but rather the main concepts. There are four exams in the semester, including the final, and you can drop your lowest grade. Therefore, if you are happy with your three midterm grades, you don't have to take the final. The final is multiple choice, where as the midterms are short answer/essay/matching/definition questions. Kocher usually gives you a good idea of what the essay question or short answers will be on the exam. The TA's also give a review session the night before each exam, which is extremely helpful. Exams are 75% of your grade, and discussion is 25%. There are weekly quizzes in discussion, as well as homework. There are three writing assignments throughout the semester, which are very easy and almost everyone gets 100% on them. Great course, definitely take it with Dr. Kocher! ",555
kocher,4,A,BSCI222,"Dr. Kocher is a very nice guy who wants you to understand the material. Although he tries to emphasize concept, a decent amount of memorization is still necessary.

Discussions are easy but highly dependent on who is your TA. There are four exams, including the final. You can drop one. I highly recommend doing well on the first three and dropping the final. Exams are not too bad. Be sure to look at past exams.

No curve and he gives pluses and minuses. Good if you have a B+, bad if you have an A-

I enjoyed the class. Kocher is the professor to take for genetics",555
kocher,5,A,BSCI222,"Great professor. I really appreciated how he just wanted us to grasp the main concepts, rather than memorize every detail.
He also put in interesting things into the lecture.
His exams are very fair, and very similar to his old exams. There are weekly quizzes in discussion with about 3-5 questions, but some of the quizzes end up being dropped, and if you look at the practice problems assigned for those chapters, you're guaranteed a 10/10.
There are also three writing assignments, and they're graded very easily. Everyone gets at least a 25/30 for doing it. 

Oh and he is a very nice guy if you go and talk to him in person.",555
kocher,5,A,BSCI222,"Dr. Kocher is an amazing professor! He cares so much about his students doing well in the course, and he spends time trying to make the material easy to understand. Unlike other biology professors, Kocher wants you to understand the main picture rather than memorize tiny details that you will forget anyway. I learned so much from this class! The tests are also very fair. If you study all of his slides, you will have no problem getting a good grade. ",555
kocher,4,A,BSCI222,"Let me tell you right now, there is no curve. Beware the A- if you're pre-med!

Exams are easy. He always tests on big ideas (like the other reviewers below me have outlined). Always take a look at his old exams before exams because he frequently repeats questions.

75% of your grade is 3 Exams, 1 Final Exam. One of these four exams is dropped (so if you do well on the three semester exams, you can drop the final exam). 

25% of your grade is discussion quizzes (pretty easy 10/10s), three essays (not too bad either) and participation. 

",555
kocher,5,A-,BSCI222,"Excellent Professor, very clear and straightforward. What's great about him is that he hates being hung up in annoying specifics just as students do (and Shields does just that from what my friends told me). His tests want you to nail down the general but crucial concepts with mastery; ie: Sample quest. from each test Fall 09 - 

First test: Gave you a pedigree and asked you to identify what the disease was (Autosomal, dominant etc) and rule out what it couldn't be and why. 

Second Test: Asked you to draw structure of a helix (1 strand) of DNA but (of course) without the nitrogenous base which makes it fairly easy. 

Third Test: Asked you to explain in your own words what the Sanger Method is. 

He doesn't like testing on the nitpicky facts so there's VERY little Multiple choice; the rest are short answers + 1 essay at the end. So never go into a midterm looking to just ""wing it""; trust me you'll fail. The single most important advice I can give you, which ultimately got me the A, is on each midterm make sure you know the concepts YOU feel were the most general but yet the most important. And by that, I mean really know them; work out several problems in the book about them, make sure you could handle a question about those topics no matter how it is formulated and where he asks you to start from. 

So this is where LECTURE, not discussion, becomes extremely important. Please, make sure to ALWAYS attend or if you really can't, then study the powerpoints he posts RELIGOUSLY!!

Ex of Important topics: 
Figuring out order of genes on a chromosome, Chi square, cloning vectors, DNA replication* (that diagram with replication forks, enzymes, etc), DNA repair, Transcription, Translation...

Ex of the kind of topics that are NOT so important:                Definitions, Simple Punnett Squares, the bottleneck effect and lol i dont even remember like gene variation?, epistasis, biotechnology...

In my opinion, he's probably your best bet for this class. Even if his classes are all filled, be patient and get on the waitlists. I can assure you that he'll definitely be worth it.  ",555
kocher,5,A-,BSCI222,"He's a good lecturer, but the material can get boring. Each lecture covers exactly one chapter in the book, and I went to about 50% of classes, but read the book and was fine. All the material is in the book. Basically, you can either go to class and learn the material, or read the book on your own time. 

There are four tests including the final, but the lowest one is dropped. His tests are pretty basic, and can be very similar to the old practice exams. 

Discussion for me only lasted 1 hour, but it depends on the TA. Some sections went 2 hours. There are weekly quizzes on the chapters, which you need to do well on, since discussion is 25% of your grade. They're also easy if you know the basics of the material.

Kocher doesn't test a lot of specifics, which is refreshing for a bio class. He just wants you to understand general concepts. There's no curve though. 90% = A, 80% = B ... 

",555
kocher,4,B+,BSCI222,"He's a good but boring professor. He drops one of your exams (including the final exam if that is your lowest exam---or you can choose not to take the final if your three midterms are good enough for you). He gave out 32% A's for the fall 2009. I ended up with a 89.33 but wouldn't give me the A. You write 3 papers, too, but they don't take much effort and generally boost your grade.",555
kocher,5,A,BSCI222,"Very good genetics professor.  He explains the material well and supplements his lectures by including interesting topics not covered in the textbook.  When he uses PowerPoints, he often goes through the slides quickly, but posts the presentations on Blackboard after the lectures.  Exams are easy and cover the most basic and important concepts.  They usually include an essay, but you can choose one of two given topics to write about and the topics are usually general or hinted upon in class.  He is also very responsive to students' needs and concerns (ex: possible changes in grading methods, exam dates, and discussion assignments).  There was no homework assigned for his lecture specifically, but the mandatory two-hour discussion sections (which another professor is in charge of) included online homework assignments and 15-minute quizzes that weren't always helpful in understanding the material.  If you took and did well in AP Biology in high school, this course shouldn't be that hard at all.",555
kocher,4,A-,BSCI222,"ill be honest, hated the class, absolutely despised it, but from what i've heard as I’ve askd around, he is the easiest genetics professor by a lot.  exams are exactly like old ones, to some extent.  literally put no effort into this class until 2-3 days before the exams when i went on intense ‘memorize old exam mode’.  it seemed to work alright.  i came out with an A- overall but was expecting to get a much lower grade.  this semester he did NOT drop the final exam, and I don't think he ever will drop the final again because of university policy.  So watch for that because.  did not understand a darn thing presented in lecture like ever.  Not to mention lectures are absolutely terrible to sit through.  No emotion at all from kocher.  Talks very quietly, but that’s just how he is and you’ll get used to it.  However I still went just in case he would hint about possible essay questions, because those are important.  But he kind of stopped hinting at essay questions after the first exam.  The first exam was very easy, and he basically told us what would be on it.  The average was very high, so he made the 2nd exam very difficult, average in the 60s I belive.  People hated on him for that, and sent nasty emails, so he stopped hinting about test questions.  3rd exam was in between the first two difficulty wise.  The point is, I recommend the guy after going through it, even though I hated it, because literally nothing makes sense in lecture, at least to me.  he goes off of powerpoints and just blabbers on about scientific methods, almost 80% of which will never show up on an exam. really in depth stuff that doesn’t mean anything to the average student.  he is the only genetics guy where you can get away with putting no effort, as long as you have old exams.  The final was much easier than I anticipated though.  I thought I had learned nothing the entire semester then pulled a B+ on the final somehow, so I suppose I learned something.  (Final exam is 50 MC while the 3 exams are all 100% writing).  Best of luck, highly recommend.  Still, it def won’t be any kind of fun.  Also, he does these things called recitations, which are the discussion thing for 2 hours.  Most professors make this really annoying, but with kocher you just talk about genetics ethics and go over homework which is basically a completion grade depending on your TA.  ",555
dayie,5,A+,BCHM465,"Dr. Dayie's class was one of the best classes I've taken. He presents the material clearly and has a genuine passion for the material. However, the textbook is a really good reference if anything is unclear. Pretty much, the only homework he assigned were questions on certain journal articles you had to read. His exams were very fair and straightforward; there were some computation questions, which were easy points. Other questions would ask you to design or analyze a sequence. A lot of it was really asking you to apply some of the basic principles that he would go over in class. Overall, great professor and very approachable outside of class.",556
dayie,1,B,BCHM465,"Horrible. Absolutely horrible.

If you are looking for a class in which:
-The professor rambles on for 50 minutes every lecture, going off on wild tangents with no coherency or central point
-The lecture slides are so horrendously prepared, that a three-year old could have organized them better
-The exams are much more challenging than the lecture slides would indicate

--then take this class. If you want a straightforward, engaging, and fair class, then BCHM465 with Dayie is not for you.

This class had so much potential--the material is inherently interesting, but Dayie bogs all of it down by emphasizing obscure papers from the 1950s and just throwing information at you with no conceptual framework in which to organize it.
Avoid this class with Dayie if you can, you will regret taking this class with him.",556
dayie,1,B+,BCHM465,"Content on exams and quizzes is literally taken from the study guides he gives out a few days before assessments, so it can be hard to stay motivated to actually learn the content. His slides are disorganized, and he can be a little slow and easily confused. He seems friendly and nice, but he can also be ignorant and rude.",556
einstein,2,A-,PHYS260,"I don't pay attention in class much and I generally get by with discussion and with the textbook. I also had friends in the class to study with. 

I had to go to his lectures because he does clicker-like attendance. I'm mostly giving him a bad review because I didn't like that policy. ",557
einstein,2,,PHYS260,He's nice and tells bad jokes but even our TA admitted he was a horrible lecturer. He mumbles and his handwriting is illegible so he's definitely not ideal for a lecture class with 200+ people.,557
einstein,3,,PHYS404,"Prof. Einstein is incredibly nice, with a good sense of humor (dry, but he is funny). He compiles an excellent website chock-full of supplementary material.

However, his lectures run very slowly and are quite dry. Much of the time, I am lost, and just mindlessly copying notes to hopefully understand later. His personal research focus is solid-state physics, and he states that he would do x ""but this is not a solid-state physics course,"" yet often it seems as though there is a higher emphasis on solid-state things than there need be.

In short: great for supplementary material, horrible for primary lecturing.",557
einstein,2,B,PHYS603,"I posted the following critique to a tool we used to allow classmates to communicate with each other and Dr. Einstein about homework:

""I have not been satisfied by the lectures thus far for the class. I thought it may be productive if there was some open conversation between the students that Dr. Einstein could see that might provide some constructive critiques about the lectures and suggestions for what changes we may like to see. Here are some notes I thought of today.

-I would appreciate it if more attention was given to notation. Today you wrote on the board a function W without (as far as I could tell) saying what W was. Another example from today was <mathematical formula not shown here>, which to me was very confusing because I'm not sure what was meant by the bar, which did not seem like standard use of notation to me.

-I would appreciate it if the goals of the analysis were more explicit. I have heard ""the game you play"" or ""what you have to do"" followed by a short explanation of the next step in the analysis, but the reasoning behind that step or what it will get us on the way is often not explicit.

-I have some difficulty understanding the motivation behind some of the goals of the analysis. Sometimes we will calculate the entropy or some other thermodynamic quantity of something, but the treatment is very abstract. While this affords a nice degree of generality, it is difficult to keep in mind what the quantities actually say about such an abstract system. It may be helpful to make references during calculations to a real physical system, even if it is just an ideal gas in a box or something of that nature.

-There has not seemed to have been thus far much explicit coherence among the topics we have discussed, no obvious thread of commonality or narrative to the content. Right now as I feel as though my notes are a laundry list of facts that apply to particular systems under particular conditions. I can follow the calculations that lead to the results, but have little appreciation of the fundamental underpinnings.

I hope that my classmates have additional comments to add that may be able to bring improvements to the lecture, and that Dr. Einstein will find these critiques helpful.""

There was no response to the critique and no attempt to reform the lecture by Dr. Einstein. Attendance in the class was extremely poor, perhaps a quarter or third of students actually attended, and in class there was an atmosphere of tension and discomfort between the students and Dr. Einstein. The class in no way helped me understand any physics, just learn a bit about symbolic mathematical manipulation.",557
einstein,5,A-,,"This class had some cool demostrations and was not too much work. We had weekly reaction papers, readings, 2 powerpoints and a final paper. We didn't have any test or quizes. He respects students opinions and wants to make the class enjoyable for us. I would recommend taking HONR228k.",557
einstein,3,A-,,"Biweekly papers, and a huge paper and presentation.  The class was overall boring but there were some pretty cool demonstrations.  The entire last two months of class we spent listening to each other's presentations.  ",557

antonsen,4,A,ENEE380H,"Antonsen was a good professor for the most part. His lectures tend to be boring but he's good at explaining the material if you manage to pay attention. The exams were alright, a combination of straightforward problems and ones we've never seen (but doable given the stuff he talked about in class). He curves generously in the end. ",558
antonsen,3,A,ENEE380H,"I took PHYS270 and ENEE380/380H with Dr. Antonsen. Physics was alright - the class itself is an odd mashup of material that was mostly very boring. Antonsen did a good job of making it bearable, often injecting humor into the giant 300 person lectures. 

380 was interesting and often very challenging - this semester the lecture was both honors and non-honors at the same time. The honors kids and regular students did exactly the same thing. I don't think I'd recommend taking this type of mixed class if you aren't doing honors - its just more challenging for non honors students who end up doing extra work they never signed up for. Antonsen was way more boring in 380 - maybe that's just the material though. 

Dr. Antonsen is a good professor and a pretty solid choice for physics. Take Waks if you can for 380, though.",558
antonsen,4,A,PHYS270,"This guy isn't that bad when you get down to the root.  This is his first semester teaching this course, so I don't know if he will teach it in the future.

Dr. Antonsen is actually from the Electrical engineering department, so what he is really good with in this course is explaining circuits.  That was one of the concepts that I understood very easily, especially because he was able to explain it in such a clear way.

Exams were moderately difficult, just about as hard as a physics exam should be.  The problems aren't plug and chug, but also aren't super difficult (though quite a few people found them hard)

Basically, read your textbook, go to class (sometimes I doze off given the driness of the subject), and do some practice problems, and you should be fine.

Overall, he's a great guy.",558
antonsen,2,A-,ENEE381,"He's nice, but his lectures are very dry, and jam-packed with information/equations. On top of that, he goes lightning quick if no one asks questions to slow him down.

holtz,5,A,GEOL104,"Great professor! He's funny and likes to tell corny jokes. You can tell he's super passionate about this topic. He gets so excited like a little boy talking about the subject. 

There is a lot of memorization that goes into this class. Don't take it unless you can memorize facts and names very well. Holtz even said up front that this class relies on memorization A LOT. 

If you put in the work and effort, you can get an A. The quizzes are easy, and his midterms usually use some of the questions from the quizzes. 

Class is great! I took it in Freshmen Connection and thoroughly enjoyed it. ",559

holtz,2,,,This class is not worth it. Its nice because the notes are online but there is so much material on tests and you need to know the all material for every exam. Beware of the grading policy also. The quizzes don't help your grade that much and make sure you do well on the Smithsonian project 1 because its worth a lot more than the second. ,559
holtz,5,A,,"This class is really not too challenging at all.  Almost all the lecture material is posted online and the exams aren't too overwhelming.  The only downside to this class is that is usually work done in discussion, so you really should attend-there's also quizzes every couple of weeks, too.  However, most of the time discussion will at least be an opportunity to boost your grade and depending on who your TA is, it might not be a lot of work.  The only big discussion assignment was the Kyoto project near the end, but that wasn't even bad.

Although most of this class is okay, a big negative about this class is that it's co-taught by 3 professors, so it seems a big ""scattered"" and overwhelming at times.  Just make sure you go through the slides before exams (there are two midterms and a final) and ask any questions about the material and you should be okay.........
Out of the three professors, I thought Holtz was the best! Granted, sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the information he presents, but he brings energy and some humor to the lectures and keeps things ""fresh""-you can tell he's really passionate about what he's doing......good luck!",559

There are 2 quizzes, a midterm and a final, but he uploads plenty of old ones, and he prepares you more than well enough for those. The TAs are alright. Overall, I learned a lot from this class, and I would recommend it for both science and non-science majors. ",562
canty,2,A,AOSC200,"This class feels like a prison. Tim Canty is not an engaging teacher and has his TA's sitting in the back of the classroom watching over the class and watching our every move.

He records his lectures and posts them online which truly is helpful and I am thankful he does that, however, by default, he encourages students to not go to class because they can view the lectures later. However, he has surprise exit cards he calls topics of the days which in turn ""scares"" or ""stresses"" students out into going into class. Also, when we have discussions, rather than reviewing material we went in class, we end up doing group projects which are supposed to support our grade. But discussion is only 50 minutes, so there isn't enough time to explain group projects and do a thorough coverage of material that was went over in class so students are put at a disadvantage. This class seems to set you up to succeed with the way he grades but if anything, it makes the class more tedious than necessary and is setting you up to actually do worse. ",562
canty,5,A,AOSC200,"Dr. Canty: Such a great professor who is really enthusiastic about the class and teaching you about weather and climate. He is really funny and he tries to keep the class engaging with demonstrations to help you visualize the concepts.

Exams: There are two exams and then the final (100 points each). Pretty easy, if you go to class and pay attention. Tim posts past exams on ELMS, but there aren't any answer keys, so you have to figure out the answers for yourself. Consists of about 10-15 multiple choice, and then 4-6 free response questions. Does not usually curve. 

Quizzes: 2 quizzes that are 40 points each. Same format as exams, just shorter.

Admission Tickets: 5 questions quizzes before every class. Answer are straight from the book.

He does do five point quizzes due before every class on ELMS, but honestly the answers come straight from the textbook. There are also ""Topic of the Day"" sections on random class days where it's more or less a way to gauge attendance. (Both of these are worth 5% of your grade individually.)

The class itself isn't difficult and doesn't require a lot of studying if you go to all the lectures.  There are two projects over the course of the semester that take a bit of time, but are graded generously and are there to boost your grade.  Would 100% take this class again.",562
canty,5,A-,AOSC200,"Very engaging, down to earth teacher. I never had him test on anything he didn't cover or have in his notes. He truly wants his students to do will but also won't put up with bs in class. He answers every genuine question and is almost always available for a one to one in office hours. Great class and great teacher. Material could get boring but he tried to make clouds as exciting as they could be.",562

Tim's passion on the class made it worthwhile and I definitely would take this class again.",562

pilachowski,1,C,MATH241,"What can I say about this guy. I honestly think he belongs teaching at an elementary school. Very unprofessional. Shows up to class 10 minutes late, and he has to rush through his lectures because he's so late. Speaking of which, his lectures notes are pretty bad. And a lot of the time when we are doing example problems in the packet, he skips a lot of them because ""we should know how to do them."" Hands down, the laziest and most apathetic math teacher I have ever come across. One day the projector wasn't working, and he legit spent the whole class trying to fix it instead of writing things on the board. It doesn't end there, if you dare ask him a question he will give you an attitude 4/5 times. Hey Tim, you are a teacher how about you freaking teach us??? He also refuses to answer any questions during DISCUSSION. The whole point of discussion is to get help and understand how to do problems but noooooooo We have to ""discuss among each other."" How am I going to ask anyone else for help when the whole freaking class doesn't know whats going on! Oh yea, he also shows up late to his office hours! Good luck trying to get help from him... 

Now here is where things will take a turn for the worst. HIS TESTS. In 50 minutes, we take a test that's 8 QUESTIONS long, all of which are extremely hard. All the other sections have the same amount of time, but only 4-5 questions per test. Talk about an unfair douche. He also does this thing where he counts down to zero at the end of the test. If you dare turn in that test a millisecond after he says ""zero"" he will penalize you. 

Some final notes, He is really apathetic about his job, very lazy and could not give a damn about his students. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SIGNING UP FOR PILACHOWSKI, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. The only people that actually do good in his class are the geniuses that would get an A in the class no matter what teacher they had.  Seriously look for a better teacher. I honestly don't understand how this bum has good reviews. ",563
pilachowski,5,B,MATH221,He is a great math professor. He makes notes you can print and bring which he goes through in class. I took MATH140 before I took him so that may have made it easier. I didn't out in as much work as I shouldmhave so I got a B but an A should be easily attainable if you study. ,563
pilachowski,4,A,STAT400,"Pilachowski is frequently late to class and never has time to answer questions during class time. Given that, it is not hard to get an A in his class. 

Print out his lecture outlines and attend all his lectures. He holds reviews before exams which is really nice and use the testbank to study! He's exams always follow the same template, and for each exam he let us have a formula sheet - front and back- and for the final we got 3! And do the hand in homework. It was easy points especially since my TA graded easily and he drops your 2 lowest scores. 

I can't say I learned a lot of statistics, but it was a fairly easy A.",563
pilachowski,5,A,STAT400,"I took STAT400 after having not done any Calculus for a few years. The Calculus in the class was fairly simple as this isn't a Calculus class, you're simply using it to calculate certain values (Covariance, mean, etc.) Professor Pilachowski went through his PowerPoint slides each class and posted supplementary material on the course website. I thought he did an excellent job at explaining the material, and the students that didn't do well were simply not interested in putting the time. I had to relearn parts of Calculus and still managed to get an A (without minus) in his class.  The most annoying part of the class was his midterms. He often didn't print enough exams or answer sheets. He also doesn't give us enough time to complete the exam. I felt incredibly pressured to finish the exam on time, and rarely did anyone leave the class before the time was up. His TA Yiran Li was exceptional. I attended every discussion and never skipped, and working through sample problems was a tremendous help. For his midterms, he will post previous exams, and if you are lucky enough, your exam might look like one of them, but don't bank on it. I recommend doing the previous exams without looking at the answers, working through homework problems, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, look over material that was taught in class and not covered in the homework (Method of Moments, Maximum Likelihood, Probability Approximations). If you don't understand something, YouTube is a great help. Yes the below is true, he comes late, he doesn't notice the clock, and can be boring at times, but he is a phenomenal and lenient teacher, and if you TAKE NOTES and study hard, you can pass with an A. I didn't visit the tutors at all for this class either, so don't stress it, just do your part. I don't consider myself mathematically gifted, I just work hard enough to earn the A, and it is doable for this class. He also allows you to bring a calculator and a sheet of notes to the midterms, and the combined sheets of notes to the final. The final was far more relaxing because I was able to revise my answers multiple times and get a good grade. I often do better on the final due to having more time.",563
pilachowski,1,,MATH220,"I honestly don't know how Professor Pilachowski received such good reviews from people. The class was a mix of those who had taken Calculus before and those who had not. I was a member of the latter group and suffered the consequences. He expected lecture outlines to be printed for every class (I didn't do it because I didn't want to use so much paper and ink). He moved extremely fast and only used a slideshow. The lessons seemed to be directed only at those who already had experience, and he responded rudely to anyone who asked questions. He was late to class multiple times and gave excuses like ""being in his office and not looking at the clock."" He was even late to the final! In addition, I had to make up and exam during his office hours and had to do so in the office, making it difficult to concentrate because he loudly (and rudely) explained and assisted other students coming in the entire time. It was an awful experience and I'm so glad I managed a C- to pass (barely, and with a huge amount of tutoring).",563
pilachowski,5,A,MATH221,"TAKE TIM'S CLASS. He is an EXCEPTIONAL calculus professor, ESPECIALLY compared with the other shitty calc teachers at this school. He is enthusiastic, easy to follow, hilarious, and very knowledgeable. He is very clear about what he expects you to know and doesn't want you to know. Plus he sometimes brings in his sugar gliders (they're like pet flying squirrels) to class! 

How to get an A-
- GO TO LECTURE. He has lecture outlines that you can follow along in.
- USE THE TESTBANK! He posts past tests AND answer keys, and they look very similar year to year - he doesn't change much.
- DO WEBASSIGN AND DISCUSSION WORKSHEETS.

The book is useful only for practice problems - the book explanations are useless compared to Tim's straightforward explanations. If you do buy it, you do NOT need the solutions manual that comes with it.",563
pilachowski,2,A,MATH220,"Pilachowski is crazy. Simply put. Not the good kind of crazy either. He teaches off of powerpoints, some of which are hard to follow. He will literally show up 10-15 minutes late for each class then take another 5 to start class. He rushes through his slides and will not usually take questions.

When he does take questions, he uses a very rude tone and can be pretty sassy. Take Fouche if you have choice.

Pilachowski will teach you 1+1 but then will give you a test with crazy stuff on it.

pilachowski,3,,,"I took MATH111 for my major/CORE requirement. Pilachowski is okay, nothing exceptional. However, my TA, Josh Schnieder, was phenomenal! He was always down to help with anything. 

All you need to do to pass this class no matter who your professor is USE THE TESTBANK to take exams used in previous years in order to study for your exams. Also, I went to each exam review before the exams with the math coordinator, can't remember his name but he was a super enthusiastic gay guy. Such a great professor... If I could remember his name I would HIGHLY recommend him because his method of teaching was great.

pilachowski,4,B,MATH131,"Math is normally a dreadful subject for me, but Prof. Pilachowski made my Calc II experience as painless as possible.  He would often come 10-15 minutes late to class, but he really cares about how well his students do so I wasn't bothered too much by the tardiness.  He posts outlines that help the lectures go more smoothly, and sometimes even prints them out for his class.  His exams are very fair.  The discussion sucked and were mandatory, but there was no way around it.  Try to get Yonathan Cwik as a TA if possible.",563

He is great! take him. I loved the TA Yonathan and Geeta. So helpful ",563
pilachowski,5,A,MATH220,"AWESOME TEACHER- kinda corny but knows his math.

Uses a powerpoint and provides print outs on his website to follow along during class. Personally I followed along fine without the powerpoints infront of me, but a lot of people benefited from them.

Easy to understand, sometimes go through slides quickly dependent on the time, but makes sure everyone comprehends the material and will stop to answer questions.

Provides optional homework but you MUST DO THE WEBASSIGN! not only does it help understanding the material and review for the tests, it is an easy 10 points

The class prior to a test is a review session- he allows the students to bring in questions to go over that will be on the test.

pilachowski,4,A,MATH220,"Tim's a weird teacher. He uses powerpoints to teach class which is pretty unconventional for math if you ask me, but it seems to work. He does kinda rush through the material, and that sometimes meant that I was woefully underprepared for the WebAssigns. There are quizzes in discussion which are actually pretty helpful, and while Tim has a bit of a temper he's overall a reasonable professor and I have learned quite a bit.

Just note that the final exam is not written by him, it's a fair bit harder than his exams.",563

For those of you who took AP Calculus in high school and despised calculus WITH A PASSION, congratulations! The class was an easy A.

Looking down on recent reviews, I don't understand why people give him bad ratings, especially since...THE PAST EXAMS AND SOLUTIONS ARE ONLINE. Pilachowski is the ONLY MATH220 PROFESSOR who posts past exams AND the answer keys.

#1 Tip: USE THE TEST BANK, PEOPLE.

When I took the class, Pilachowski said that he had to make the tests harder because (surprise!) people were doing TOO WELL on the exams. Exam 3 came around, and the questions didn't get harder.

Listen to my advice please. The class is doable, and the teacher knows how to teach the material well. The homework felt harder than the exams that weren't so bad because of the Test Bank online.",563

In the corresponding webassigns for the classes he subbed, I struggled to get B's.  Every other ones I get 100's or at least high 90's.  Can't imagine him for a whole semester.",563
pilachowski,5,A,MATH220,"His lectures were easy to follow, and he communicates very directly about what you need to know and what you don't.

pilachowski,4,B,MATH220,"Very enthusiastic and funny professor. He incorporates humor into his lectures which helped to ease the stress of the course material. He teaches from powerpoints and posts lecture outlines on his website which you can print off. There are several homework assignments each week on WebAssign, an online program (you have to pay about $15 to use). There are three tests before the final. The problems Pilachowski uses in his lectures are much simpler than the ones on WebAssign and on tests, but there are many opportunities for you to get help. You must complete a worksheet in discussion each week, worth ten points. But you are allowed to work in groups and help each other. Good professor, I enjoyed having him. ",563
pilachowski,4,A,MATH221,"I have no idea why people rate him this low; he's at least a 4/5 teacher. 

As you probably know, Math 220/221 has the reputation of being the calculus for dummies. While that's generally true, it is less so in Pilachowski's class. He doesn't dumb down his teaching just because it's supposed to be an easy class. That said, he's definitely the hardest teacher for the subject. However, if you take him you'll be counting your blessings when taking the final exam, which is the product of a colaborative departmental effort. His class makes an otherwise frustrating final a fairly easy task. 

His exams aren't as easy as you'd come to expect from a 220/221 class. They actually require knowledge of the subject. He offers 4 extra credit points on his exams, which can really mean a difference between an A and a B. 

To do well in the class COME TO LECTURES! He uses powerpoint slides that he DOES NOT POST ONLINE. The only way to make up the information is by asking a friend for notes or reading the book. Absolutely do old practice exams from previous years (available on test bank). They're all in the same format and the questions tend to be very similar to one another. Answers are also available.  

Some people mentioned that he appears to be condescending to students. He really isn't. There's a fine line between a condescending attitude and a person's quirks. In Pilachowski's case, he's just really quirky, something these commenters failed to realize. Just keep an open mind and you won't even notice his oddities after a while. 

On the bad side, he is, like many mentioned, always late to class. This means he covers material somewhat superficially (not always) and goes over the 50 minutes alloted for class (always). He tends to make numerous mistakes, but they're rather minor arithmatic issues rather than calculus issues. He doesn't curve at all and doesn't allow any calculator use.    ",563
pilachowski,4,A,MATH220,"Timmy P is a great teacher.  Everything is straight forward, and he is extremely organized to the point of OCD-but thats not a bad thing! His exams are completely fair, and even though he doesn't scale, its usually not necessary. The only bad thing is he can be pretty condescending to anyone who asks a question, even in his office hours. But overall I definitely recommend him! He's engaging and even has his funny moments. And its fine if you're late, he always is too!",563
pilachowski,4,,MATH220,"Pretty good professor. Explained things clearly and thoroughly, always well organized (uses powerpoints). I learned a lot, and his exams weren't too difficult.

pilachowski,3,B,MATH221,"Dr. Pilachowski was a great professor. I learned so much from him personally, I find calc2 much easier than calc1. Anyways so many people rate him low, and that's because lots of ppl do bad in his class.. the ones that do NOT do the webassign BY THEMSELVES (yes--we know you can do virtually all of the problems in the TI-89) will do poorly because if you are able to do the webassigns and some of the practice book problems, then you WILL GET AN A. I just so happen to not get an A because I did miss a couple of classes... The final exam will be a piece of cake to you, since he is the hardest prof to take for calc, and all the calc profs write the exam together. I had a 95% on the final exam, was happy, and i believe there was a curve on the class...

I found that more useful than a chalkboard because it's easy to copy off of and keeps my notes organized. The discussions are nice because you have group worksheets that are always a guaranteed 100% because the TA goes over the answers at the end. Webassign can be a pain, especially if you have other exams to study for, but they are not that bad. It is important to do the webassign because they will count as an exam grade at the end. Overall, an easy class if you go to lecture and discussion.  ",563
pilachowski,4,,MATH220,"I don't know why everyone is rating him so low, because I felt like I learned a lot from this class. Maybe everyone just hates powerpoint, but I found it useful because it kept things organized and I could take notes really easily. Even if I didn't really understand what was going on during class, the notes were always easy to read and I could see exactly what he did, and apply that to the webassign problems. 

It's pretty hard not to do well in this class, since there were plenty of points from the homework and discussion worksheets (which you HAVE to do in groups, so you almost always get 10/10). Tests are fair, though there's always one or two tricky questions.

His exams are relatively hard without a calculus background. Many friends who even took calculus before still had C's on exams. He tries to have tricky questions.

As a professor I also did not appreciate him. He had a very matter-of-fact tone of voice and would make students feel stupid if they asked a question. Oh and if you ask to repeat a slide sometimes he might straight up say no.

I would avoid this professor because he is not my ideal teacher. Perhaps he is for some but I heard there are much better professors.

He also puts tricky problems on the quizzes even though we only get about 5 minutes to do them. As a result, you feel pressured and get text anxiety easily because you feel rushed. Also, he will make a mistake while solving a problem in class, and then he will say, ""I was just testing you to see if you would catch me."" HAHA! I don't think so.

No curves :( but he says that he will round up to the next letter grade if you're very close ex/ 89.1 to an A or 79.1 to a B.

pilachowski,1,B-,MATH120,"Tim is the ABSOLUTE worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of having. He is  the most rude and bitter man I have ever encountered. DURING our “review” he wouldn’t even turn the light off when a student nicely asked him too because nobody could actually SEE HIS notes for the exam. I put “review” in quotations because his idea of a review is not at all helpful in preparing for the exam. He refuses to give you the answers to the worksheet he hands out. You’ll spend the whole class trying to figure out the answers and he will not answer any questions. 
He teaches calc on a PowerPoint which has proven to be the LEAST EFFECTIVE way to do this. Don’t bother trying to write anything down because you won’t have time & if you do you won’t be able to pay attention to how you actually do it. Although he does a terrible job of explaining the information anyway. 
If you have the great misfortune of having him as your teacher you will have to listen to him go over stupid class rules nearly every class. ONE time he even spent 20 minutes in the beginning of class going over “bike safety”. Nobody else in the class understood why he was doing this or what was going on. However I knew exactly what happened because the day before I saw him screaming at some kid riding his bike because he almost got hit by him. So basically he wasted all of our time because of his own personal issues. He is the worst. 
The TA’S even admit he makes exams 10x harder then necessary. My TA told my class that for teachers like Tim who make the exams harder than the worksheets and homework he gives you, you should research online other schools and their coursework to try and learn the information. Because it’s my job to teach myself right?! 
If you take this class this will 100% be the case. Guaranteed you’ll be teaching yourself all of the information. If you have absolutely no background in calc then you are extremely screwed for his class. 
There are also no curves in his class even though so many people argue how unfair his tests are. ALSO, his advice to go look at passed exams will not help you in the slightest. He claims that they are similar to the exams, but they’re not at all. 
I learned more WHEN THE TA sub’d for him for a day and actually wrote and explained the information on the board, then during the whole semester with him teaching. 
Another thing is that you’ll have lecture quizzes all the time in this class. He says they’re only once a week but a lot of times they’re twice a week. If you leave lecture even 10 min early there’s a good chance you’ll miss one because sometimes he’ll give them in the last 5 min of class!! 
There is also SO MUCH HW.. at least 5 assignments with 10-15 problems each w likelihood of having a-e parts as well due every week. 
It is clear that he doesn’t understand the concept of actually teaching. I highly recommend you look elsewhere for teachers because unless you are amazing at calc you will spend the the full semester trying to learn on your own.

I went to discuss one of my exams with him during his office hours, but he was very condescending. However, his exams were similar to the discussion worksheets, which was a relief (though I had already taken the course in high school). I give him 2 stars because I thought his class was easy, but I would NOT recommend for those new to Calc 1. I'm sorry if you have to take him nevertheless.",563
pilachowski,1,B,STAT400,"DO NOT TAKE HIS STAT 400. It's boring. He just reads the slides. You don't have to take his class, Just stay at home, and do the test bank. ",563
pilachowski,4,A+,STAT400,"Professor Pilachowski does a great job of teaching statistics. I took AP statistics in high school, and the two classes are almost identical in content. (The differences are that STAT400 includes a tiny bit of integration and some more specific named probability distributions, while AP statistics includes hypothesis testing and linear regressions.) In comparison, Pilachowski was a much better instructor who could teach the concepts in a clear and organized fashion. However, I did find that he was not very helpful with answering any questions if you were confused about the subject matter.",563
pilachowski,3,C,MATH120,"Prof Pilachowski himself seems like a nice person, but the way he teaches and converses with students just doesn’t work for me. Class is all online this semester and attendance isn’t required because he doesn’t do any in-class participation stuff (thank god), so the structure of things is that he has students watch lecture videos he posts on ELMS, then come to the live sessions with any questions. Personally I’m really not a math person, and his lecture videos are usually clear and organized, but the live sessions are just confusing because the way he explains things only complicated things more for a lot of students. In addition, he is TERRIBLE at responding to emails. It takes him weeks, and his office hours are by appointment this semester, so the only way to contact him is email, even just to set up an office hour appointment. He will drop a few low-scored homework and discussion worksheets at the end of the semester, which is a godsend because there are a lot of worksheets, and Prof Pilachowski never gives extensions on anything (deadlines are pre-set and definite). Overall, he knows his stuff, but tends to be very unhelpful with accommodating his student’s needs (where I’m coming from on this is I have accommodations, and it was incredibly and unreasonably difficult to meet with him to get that all sorted out).",563
centorbi,1,A-,GEOL100,"Centorbi is one of the most incompetent professors I've had at Maryland. She told multiple students when asked if grades on ELMS were correct and weighted when it said that it was unweighted online. Even after she said all of this, now at the end of the semester she has changed everyone's grades to weighted and grades have dropped from 5-10%. I went from an A to a B. The only thing saving my A right now is the 5% extra credit field trip. 

The class isn't too hard (she drops the lowest test, in-class activity, and homework/hw quiz grades), and she's changed her tests so they are all concept sketches with no multiple choice. However, she is a boring lecturer with a snarky attitude. I'm only taking this class for my science lab requirement but I have no idea how she has taught this class for so many years and can still be so uninformed and wrong when it comes to ELMS. 

Seriously disappointed in her lack of professionalism.",566
centorbi,5,,GEOL100,"I really like her she teaches straight out of the textbook. You have your online homework and online quiz due each week for the chapter and then at the end of the section there is an in class exercise. SHE HAS RECENTLY CHANGE THE WAY TEST ARE GIVEN, for GEOL 100 they use to be online test and the other teachers still give the online tests but in her class each test is 4 chapters long and she gives you about 2 questions per chapter that relate to a visual that has been reviewed in the class. So for the tests on the day of the exam 2 of the total 8 sketches will be chosen at random and then you must draw the sketches from your memory. But they are all given ahead so you just have to prepare a lot and you will be fine because it's all memorization. Overall I enjoy her as and GEOL 100 and would recommend it    ",566
centorbi,5,A,GEOL120,"The reviews saying she is an awful teacher have to be coming from people who skip class or don't study for the exams. Centorbi is a great teacher; she thoroughly reviews everything in the book to the point where I stopped reading the chapters and still felt very informed. It's easy to do well on the test if you take notes in class and review them beforehand, but she makes it even easier since the tests are open notes/textbook/internet. She's a very nice person and I recommend sitting in the first few rows as she often interacts with people and may give you hints on the clicker questions. The only complaints I would have is that discussions are work-heavy and the TA is kind of an asshole, but even he grades super loosely. It's easy to get an A in this class if you attend regularly and do the in-class activities assigned. You're also permitted to miss four days before she starts docking off participation points since the lowest four clicker grades are dropped.

Bottom line: Not a hard class if you pay attention, teacher is great, interesting content aside from rocks.",566
centorbi,5,A,GEOL100,"I had the pleasure of Tracey as a professor for GEOL100 and it was easily the best class I had taken.  Tracey's super nice, cheerful, and breaks all concepts down really well.  Students from all majors should be able to understand the topics, regardless of your background.  The topics were actually really cool and interesting as well.  The lab had a great TA and went pretty hand-in-hand with the chapters to give you that ""next-level"" feel for what you're discussing.  The extra credit field trip was a lot of fun too.  I've kept in contact with Tracey and keep her updated on how my semesters are going.

And truthfully, I'm fairly shocked regarding some of the reviews on here.  But after reading through some, a lot sound like students who didn't read, didn't study, and wanted an easy A because they thought Geology would be the ""easiest science class.""  If you keep up with the material, do light studying/reviewing regularly, use her lecture notes as guides along with your own, and actually try to care, you shouldn't have problems.",566
centorbi,1,B,GEOL100,"Listen to the other reviews advising you to take another teacher! Seriously this teacher is the motherfucking devil. I took a 100 level class in rocks and it ended up being the class witht he most exhausting workload. 

There are three online tests and one in class cumulative test. Her online tests she gets most of them from previous homework/quizes.and google. 

Her cumulative final though is ridiculous! She says it's easier because it's in person but it's not. This is not a 100 level class. 

I feel like I'm leaving this class with a PHD in rocks. ",566
centorbi,1,B,GEOL120,"So, I have never written one of these reviews but this was probably my worst class in my 4 years at the school so instead of studying for the final, I am writing this. I am taking geol120 as my core requirement and not only is Centorbi HORRIBLE, but this class is more demanding than any of my other upper level classes. The only way to do somewhat ok in this class is to go to every lecture and record every single thing she says. Even then- you probably won't do well on her tests. Her tests are online, but even so I got 60's on the tests. Her power points are useless, as is the book. You haven't seen half the stuff on the tests before. She is rude, condescending, and takes her 100 level class WAY to seriously. Without the extra credit field trip and discussion board to replace your lowest test grade, the class is almost impossible. The discussions also have quizzes so you cannot miss any of them, and the TA's are just as unhelpful as her. The final is also (in-person) 100 questions cumulative on the entire class- and you are allowed 1 notecard. This cheat sheet would make sense for a math class, not for a class testing you on the entire text book. This is by far the worst class I have taken at this university and I wish someone would have warned me when I signed up. ",566
centorbi,2,A,GEOL120,"The class isn't hard but graded harshly and there's a lot of work involved. She's a cool person, but takes the work and class way too seriously. The TAs made up for it (they were really cool, laid back, an funny).
The information is straight-forward and she does a good job explaining concepts, but the work load is ridiculous and discussions are pointless.
The textbook is cheap (ten dollars) because she uses not the latest edition.
The tests are made with trick questions rather than comprehensive or factual questions. If you try to tell her your answer was directly written from the textbook used for the class, she'll discredit it.
The clickers are good idea but poorly executed. She grades them and half of the time they are questions out of no where. 
The extra credit was an interesting trip and worth it to go(5% extra) but there's a worksheet to fill out which takes up the entire trip so you can't enjoy actually being there.
Discussion involves reading news semi-relevant articles and memorizing random facts for a 3 point quiz. Then we do worksheets that are relevant. 
Overall, the class was not worth taking. ",566
centorbi,1,A,GEOL120,"This teacher is the worst, the class is the worst, but it's an easy A. 
If you want to actually learn things about geology, look elsewhere. If you want an easy CORE class with a self-important ***** for a teacher, look no further. 
Teacher is the typical example of a person who takes herself too seriously, she is the worst. She's an unhappy person and, naturally, she enjoys the ""power"" of being a professor. 
In conclusion, she is the devil.  ",566
centorbi,4,B+,GEOL100,"Centorbi is a wonderful person but an incredibly hard teacher.  I got an A in the class by recording her lectures and then typing down what she said verbatim and using that for the exams.  That is a LOT of work and I still only got by with an A (including the 5% extra credit trip).  A lot of people underestimate this class cuz its supposed to be the easiest lab - which it IS, but that doesn't mean it's easy.  must go to every class for clicker scores, do the geotours to cancel out a bad exam, and take awesome notes or be prepared to fail.  DO THE EXTRA CREDIT TRIP --- not only was it really fun but it seriously helps your grade!  ",566
centorbi,4,A,GEOL100,"I chose this course (along with GEOL110) to fulfill my lab credit core. Yes, it is not the easiest class, but for a science class, I don't think it could get much easier. The tests are tricky but really not as difficult as people say. Go to her lectures, write down everything she says and you will be fine. She is not some evil teacher, she is very fair. Her tests are online, you have to expect them to be kind of challenging or else this class would be too easy. There is an hour and 15 minutes to do 60 questions on each test, so there is plenty of time to look stuff up as long as you are organized. ",566
centorbi,2,B,GEOL100,"Do not take this class. Seriously, I don't care what anyone tells you. It is not easy. My friends told me it was easy, but its not. Even if you think you can cheat and do the online tests with people, the tests are so convoluted with tricky questions and ridiculous diagrams that you can't possibly do well on them. You have to go to every class for clicker exams which you always fail b/c she expects you to pay attention the entire time and then understand exactly what she just taught you. Its a complete waste of time and brings down your GPA for no reason. She loves to trick you, she's fat, and she's a horrible teacher.  ",566
centorbi,3,B+,GEOL120,"NOT AN EASY CORE CLASS AT ALL. Her tests are online, but impossible to take. You'll have to read between the lines to understand the stuff she talks about, very vague. You also have to go to every lecture because she uses stupid 'clickers' to give participation grades and if you get a question wrong in the participation you get 50% for that question. Also she has a ""no excuses"" policy so if you're sick or dying and do an assignment you get a zero. Which is complete BULLSH@T. If I'm sick in the hospital hooked up to IVs and feel like shit, you're telling me I can't have an extension on the assignment?? BULLSH!T",566
centorbi,5,A,GEOL100,"I don't know why everyone is saying this class is hard, it's not. The class is clicker points, online homework, and online tests, and a huge extra credit assignment. Put in a little effort, and you'll get an A easily",566
centorbi,3,A,GEOL100,"This class is pretty difficult, but you'll learn a lot in a really short amount of time. Do the extra credit she gives you. You'll need it.",566
centorbi,1,B,GEOL120,"This class is so hard. I always went to lecture, wrote down what she said, and took notes on the book chapters. The tests are online, which sounds great, but they're ridiculously hard. She only gives you an hour and fifteen minutes to complete them but it could easily take me 2 hours to find all the answers. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. I'd much rather take an in class test that is easier than taking this course online.",566
centorbi,3,A,GEOL120,"This was a really tough class.  Although I got an A, it was with a lot of difficulty and hard work.  You will have to go above and beyond for this class, but its relatively little assignments that you just have to keep up with, not really huge papers or assignments besides the three exams, which are online.  Do the discussion board, do the extra credit.  Also, i suggest taking notes on your laptop or else you will miss typing down half of the information she puts on the test.  
Basically, type down everything she says, and everything that is on the powerpoints and videos.  It will come back on the exams",566
centorbi,2,A,GEOL120,"I don't know half the people who wrote the reviews below, but they must be geology majors. This class was awful, easily the worst class ever. When you first get to the class and she tells you the tests are online, you get excited, but they are not based off the textbook at all. My first test I got a 75 with just studying off the book. The next 2 I just studied off of what she said in lecture and the slides and did better. I would recommend doing the discussion board because it is easy and to do the extra credit which is now only worth 5%. Also she is just a miserable *****. I have had teachers get mad at students for leaving class early, and even calling them out, but she would go on for a few minutes about why you shouldn't leave early. ",566
centorbi,2,A,GEOL100,"She is really not a good teacher at all. She is really mean and just really annoying. The class overall is easy. All the tests are online, including the final. You have to go to class though because she randomly gives in class exercises that are worth 10% of your grade. If you go on a field trip with her you get 5% added to your grade which is huge. Also, if 90% of people do course evaluations you get another 2% extra credit making an 83% an A. Take it, but don't expect to learn anything. ",566
centorbi,1,,GEOL100,"This class was a waste of time. I wouldn't have taken it had I not needed a CORE lab science credit. Centorbi can be downright rude and has a bad attitude 75% of the time. Also, she moves way too fast during lecture. Printing lecture slides is a must because she does not give anyone time to write down information off of powerpoints during class. However, I refuse to waste all that paper and ink and therefore struggled with keeping up with her lectures.

Her knowledge of geology is greatly apparent and she really does know what she is talking about. All exams are online which sounds awesome but in reality they are tough. I never scored above a C on one even though I did the 13 page review guide for every one. Attending lectures is a must because she randomly gives out in class assignments that are graded. Overall I really did not enjoy this class at all.

",566
centorbi,3,A,GEOL120,"Class isn't hard if you do the work (not much), online exams mean you can use your notes and textbook, lecture is boring and but informative. She takes lectures straight out of the textbook and adds her own stuff. Many test questions come word-for-word from sentences in the book. You HAVE to go to discussion if you want to pass because almost half your grades come from there, but it is super easy if you do the (one-page) readings for the quizzes and if you work fast you can get out half an hour early most days. Also you get a day off from lecture whenever there is an online test, which is pretty nice.

Prof. Centorbi does a pretty good job. She seems nice enough in person, but she randomly becomes rather bitter and pessimistic in her lectures. She has a ""NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ANYTHING EVER"" policy which gets pretty ridiculous. She's also one of those profs who calls out students for texting and talking in class. But the class is easy so it's hard to fault her too much.

Boring class, kooky prof, pretty standard for UMD.",566
centorbi,2,B,GEOL120,"This class was honestly annoying and I did not benefit from taking it. Even though the exams are posted online, they are hard and the questions she asks are sometimes not even in the notes or lecture. What was even more ridiculous was that there were no exceptions on making up an exam and she even posted on our syllabus…
""There are NO makeup exams for any reason!! Not if you are sick, not if there's a death in the family, not if your boyfriend/girlfriend ends up in the hospital, not if you have a car accident, not if you forget because you fell asleep after turning in your paper for another class. Complete it by midnight on Friday or take the zero.""

honestly… thats just downright mean. Also if you miss discussion you get an automatic zero on an activity which is worth 35-45 points and you get a 0 on a 3-5 point quiz. 

I was bored to death in her lectures and had to struggle to keep myself awake most of the time. If you want to take GEOL120 i would suggest taking it with another professor. ",566
centorbi,3,C,GEOL120,"GEOL120 Powerpoint style with all the slides online. The tests are online but you can't do well on them on just the slides alone, you have to attend lecture. In lecture there are in class activities that count towards your grade. You have reading due for every discussion and a short 3 question quiz about the reading. Then there are activities in discussion. Some of the activities are very time consuming and sometimes aren't really related to class. There are 2 opportunities for extra credit: one field trip, and participation on the discussion board which will replace your lowest test grade. If you attend lecture and take good notes and do the extra credit you should get an A, I didn't do these things.  As a teacher though she is nice but the material is very boring. ",566
centorbi,4,A,GEOL100,"I loved this class! Most of the information was really interesting, but some was pretty dry. The class moves pretty fast, so you have to keep up.
You don't really need to go to lecture since she posts the slides on elms, but if you do, she does give many hints for upcoming exams.  Also, there's plenty of opporunities to get extra credit, like a field trip that can get you up to 10%!
The tests are online, which is good because you can use your notes, but she uses this testing system that shuts you out of the test if anything else is open.  You have to turn off all automatic updates and virus scans and everything, which was a big pain.
But overall, i took this class as an elective and it wasn't too bad.  Before all the exams, i printed out all the powerpoints and went through them using the book and did well on all three of the mid terms. the final had so many recycled questions, it wasn't bad.",566
centorbi,3,A,GEOL120,"If you decide to take this course, make sure you go to lecture, since she says A LOT of stuff that isn't in the book. The exams for this course were weird. I felt a lot of the questions were neither in the book, nor were they mentioned in lectures, so I found my self guessing answers. 

Discussion sections are really important too, even though most of what you do in discussion really don't help you much on any of the exams. The exercises will help your grade a lot.

As for the professor herself, I thought she was cool/ok at the beginning of the semester, but as the semester went on, she was just unnecessarily a jerk to people.

The best thing about this course is the extra credit field trip. It's worth 10% of your grade, and it's a fairly easy exercise which isn't graded harshly, so it's easy to get a 100% on. Whatever you do, MAKE SURE YOU GO ON THE TRIP! It really paid off.",566
centorbi,3,A,GEOL120,"The first thing you should know about this class is that it is top 5 most boring classes available at Maryland.  She posts her slides online, but she always says stuff that isn't on the slides that goes on the exams.  You don't really need to go to lecture (like 1/2 our class), but if your too honest to skip lecture, bring something to entertain yourself with.

Her exams were all online, but they were all very difficult.  One good thing about this course is that there is a lot of extra credit chances to make up points.  If you post on the weekly discussion board, you get graded on your posts and that grade replaces your lowest exam grade.  Also, theres a extra credit field trip that added 10% to your final grade.  So if you had an 80% you would have a 90% and an A.  

Discussion sections are easy points that make up 25% of your grade, but the work can be time consuming.  All in all, this was an annoying class that required a lot of work, but in the end, if you put in the work, you should do ok.",566
centorbi,1,A,GEOL120,"So much to say!
A- I hated this class. If it was not the easiest of the Cores that it fulfills, no one would take this class. The class does not teach you anything that you wouldnt already know.  Her lectures are full of crap like ""Global Warming is bad for people, the animals, and  the environment."" Really? I didnt know that? On the other hand, her class is so easy. Study from her PP and you should easily get A's on the tests.
B- I hate this teacher. I had her last year and she is a miserable person and an even worse teacher. I emailed her a picture of my hospital bracelet WHILE I was still in the hospital and she wouldnt believe that I couldnt take the test because I was ill. I had to take her to the Dean and he eventually made her let me retake it. When I retook it I scored like a 90% on the multiple choice but surprisingly scored a 70% on anything that she graded and was subjective. She constantly made up lies about things I supposedly told her, and she was not at all understanding about my condition.

In GEOL120, Centorbi covered a chapter or two from the book each week (which you really have to read if you want to ace the exams and final), and after four chapters there would be an exam that consists of 2 out of 8 potential concept sketches. It's very easy to study for the exams as they are just diagrams you can prepare and consult with her about prior to the test.

Overall, the course was a very achievable A but not an easy one. You actually have to work harder than you did in high school to get the grade you deserve (shocker!) With that, she really is nice to those who put in the effort and try to fully understand her subject.",566

For a level 100 you can definitely find another class for your NS or lab that wall be much less work. She offers a 5% extra credit at the end, and I highly recommend doing this.

FULL REVIEW:
Each week we were assigned: 30-100 hw problems (100pts), a quiz (40pts), 8-10 lecture videos with participation quizzes through out (you must watch these lecture videos because the these quizzes are scattered throughout and alone are worth 20% of final grade). All in all I spent at least 10+ hours a week for this professor alone. Exam weeks easily make this go to 15+. This is an absurd amount of work for an 100 level course. 

Each exam covered 3 chapters. It might not seem like much but take my word, it's a lot. Of everything that could be on the exam, we were tested on the simplest things like identifying different kinds of rocks.

I gave two starts because she's a really nice person, but a mean professor. Her expectations of the students were way too high for an 100 level course. ",566

centorbi,3,,GEOL100,"I took GEOL100 completely online in Fall 2020, and the class was entirely asynchronous. It wasn't the worst class and not too difficult in my opinion. She would publish a bunch of lecture videos each Monday that would range from 5 to 20 minutes each and were easy to follow along with, just extremely boring. Embedded in the lecture videos were quiz questions about the content of the lectures, and some weeks these questions were retakeable until you got them right, and sometimes they weren't, there was no pattern to it. You would also be assigned a chapter to read each week from the textbook, and the textbook was interactive so there was a grade for completing the questions for each chapter. Most weeks I didn't even read the chapter and just answered the questions until I got them all right (they were graded for completion). My biggest complaint about this class is that the quizzes we had each week were created through the textbook service, so the questions were based entirely off of the textbook and not the lectures at all. Luckily, the quizzes are open note and you get two tries on them. There was a midterm roughly every three weeks in this class, and the midterms were based off of the lectures. The midterms also felt very ""unpolished,"" there were often repeated questions, etc. Centorbi would also use a browser extension to prevent cheating on the exams that would film you the entire time. I would definitely study for the exams, but they weren't extremely difficult. She also had no TAs for this class, so the only way to contact her outside of emailing was her office hours that were only hosted once a week. Overall, not too difficult of a class, but definitely not an easy A if you don't have at least some interest in the subject.",566

She says that she builds her exams mainly on the lecture videos she posts, the textbook material only factors a small amount into the exam. She also uses Honorlock. However, after discussions with the students, she removed all of Honorlock's predatory requirements.

In the final month, the class took a turn for the better. Due to the pandemic, the college allowed professors to make finals optional. The professor did, which allowed most of us to save our grades. If you think remembering hundreds of terms for one exam is rough, imagine studying for a cumulative final exam. She also posted an extra credit assignment, which added five points to your total grade.",566
centorbi,3,A+,GEOL110,The lab was horrible but it was easy. There was so much work involved and if it wasn't for the extra credit offered at the end I'd have a very different grade than the one I ended up with. ,566

dumitras,4,A,ENEE140,"Tudor's a pretty chill guy and a good teacher. He tries to structure his lectures around the concepts students find most difficult from assigned readings which helps. The homework he assigns for this class is fairly straightforward and ties in directly with projects he assigns for this class. His projects aren't too hard, but they take time.",567
dumitras,4,A-,ENEE140,"Professor Tudor was very easy going and very approachable. I wish his lectures were structured a little better. The projects are ridiculously tedious for a two credit class, but I feel as it did prepare me for 150. ",567
dumitras,4,A-,ENEE140,"He’s a pretty good prof, but his lectures are a little disorganized. If you ask questions he’s good at clarifying though. He was consistently 5-10 minutes late and would hold us 10-15 minutes past the end of class, but this is likely just a online-learning thing. Overall nice Professor and not too hard of a class!",567
vishkin,2,,ENEE446,"Lectures were dry and very text dense - think slides upon slides filled with 9 point font. There were about six chapters in the book, and each had its own 100-150 slide set provided by the publishers, which is exactly what was went over in class. Vishkin adds some notes here and there but it's more or less words words words. He skips very quickly over the book stuff in an attempt to get to his own research, which is fairly interesting, I suppose. He mentioned like 10-20 times over the semester he was researching so and so and we were encouraged to research under him.

The book slides aren't fantastic for both this reason and the fact that they take, say, 10 pages to explain something that is in reality quite simple. The exercise are quite long, due about every three weeks, and they are annoying only because they range between very vague, open ended design questions to stupid common-sense questions. They were also not graded especially well by the TA. I had some of my solutions which were entirely incorrect get full credit and some solutions with a small typo get almost none. At a certain point in the semester I just started bullshitting the whole thing in an hour or two and getting the same scores as when I was spending 10 hours on each assignment.

One test, one final, both straightforward. Some definitions, some simple calculations, and some open-ended thought questions. 75% of the class is more or less rehashed from the honors version of 350, so I pretty much got an A not studying at all and just remembering what I had already learned.",568
vishkin,5,B,ENEE446,"ENEE446 is a very insightful course, which in combination with Prof. Vishkin gets even more powerful. This course is not for the one's who just want to do exercise at the end of each chapter, but with this course students are expected to make equal effort as much as prof does on you. Prof. Vishkin has deep understanding and passion for the material required for this course and he delivers it at its best. The fact that he provides real life examples and current trends in computer industry makes his lecture very interesting. There's allot to absorb from the course and prof. Vishkin's lectures, so a constant effort interms of reading the material of textbook and attending the class lectures attentively is required. Final comment on this note is that my perspective towards pc have changed from what I had before taking this course and what it is after completion of this course, and am surely considering to make my career along this path. ",568
vishkin,5,A,,"I took the ENEE 759K[Parallel Algorithmics] course with Dr.Vishkin in Spring 2012 and I would definitely rate it as one of the best I have taken thus far at UMD, in terms of the depth in the concepts, the cutting edge nature of the field and its future scope.

LECTURES: According to me, the most valuable part of the course were the lectures. The Professor clearly had a thorough understanding and passion for the field and he took care to ensure that the students understood the material taught in the lectures.

COURSE MATERIAL: A key factor of the course is its breadth - the material has been chosen to provide the students with an exposure to a range of Elementary routines, Techniques and Paradigms in the field of Parallel Algorithms. The students are also taught how to apply these ""tools"" as building blocks to create more involved Parallel Algorithms. At the end of the course, with a good grasp of the various tools and their application, the student will be able to get a clear idea of how to approach any new problem in the field.

ASSIGNMENTS: The programming assignments gave an opportunity for the students to actually implement the techniques learnt and produce very significant speed-ups. It also enabled the students to see for themselves that Parallel Programming on XMTC[PRAM-model] could be much simpler when compared to other Parallel Programming techniques. The Dry homework tested the ability of the students to apply the concepts learnt in class.

EXAMS & GRADING: The two examinations were open-book and tested the student's understanding of the techniques. The Professor also gives due credit to students who demonstrate clear improvement as the class progresses.

Both the Professor and the TA were very helpful and were quick to clear every doubt the students had. The students were also given a clear break-up of the points for the Assignments and the Exams.

I would strongly recommend the Parallel Algorithmics course by Dr.Vishkin as it is very relevant and the concepts taught have significant scope for application in the future.

",568
vishkin,1,,ENEE641,"His homework is straight out of the posted solutions on the book website, and won't care if you copy the answers. Teaches well, but his exams are really tough, and his grading scale is very subjective - the final can be up to 85% of your grade, so you won't know your grade until after it's posted. DON'T take 641 unless you were a CE major - or you might have to drop it after getting back the midterm grade. His exam reviews are very short - he will not give you any hints or general areas to study, nor will he review material unless someone asks a specific question about it in advance. He also advertises his parallel algorithms class, which only like 4 people from MD registered for this past semester",568
vishkin,5,A,,"I am surprised that so few have registered for the Fall 2010 ENEE459P course on parallel algorithms. I took ENEE459P with Dr. Vishkin in Spring 2008 and found it to be a relevant and informative course.

The lectures (two 75-minute lectures per week) were very helpful in understanding the course material. The professor often asked students questions during the lecture to make sure everyone understood the material, and he answered any questions I had as well. I could tell that he cared about the material he taught and understood it well. There is a book-like set of class notes posted on the course website, but I found that the notes were easier to understand after attending the lectures.

As a computer engineering major, I found the programming assignments to be a fun and valuable part of the course. The assignments are loosely based on algorithms given in the class notes, and the assignment sheets clearly explain what needs to be done. The assignments require only a little knowledge of C programming and relatively few lines of code. Most of the work is in understanding how to translate the high-level descriptions given in class into a working program. I found this to be the most educational part of the assignments, and it helped me to appreciate how simple parallel programming can be given the right platform.

The written homework was more difficult but worth the trouble. The questions required some thinking beyond merely restating things from the text. I personally appreciated the challenge, but even if you have a hard time with the questions, it does not hurt your grade very much. Figuring out the answers to the questions definitely helped me to understand the subject.

Grading was very fair, and the grader/TA explained why points were taken off for certain things. The professor and TA were available to answer questions outside of class. The professor was especially willing to spend some time with students to explain anything that they found confusing.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to computer science and computer engineering majors, and would encourage anyone interested in the future of computing to consider the course as well.",568
vishkin,1,A-,,"I was so excited when I registered for this course (ENEE159V). I am sophmore in Computer Science. The grade I expect is at least A- and if i get lower than this grade I would be mad. However, The lecture was so boring and I think the professor should divide it into two lectures per week. The notes were unclear and they were not for freshmen. they should be taught for seniors. This course is very difficult his projects are waste of time. The projects takes at least 20 hours and maybo more to be done because they were unclear and not related to the notes. If you want to understand and finish the project you should do research and read other books and article on the internet. The TA was unhelpfull. if you send him an email he doesn't reply. I think he was easy on grading. and the good thing about the class that he didn't have tests. if he would have tests i would fail the class because i didn't understand anything. 

The professor was good and nice with students. But he needs make it easier for students and to have more clear HomeWork and notes.",568

romero_danilo,3,,ENEE313,"*****THIS REVIEW IS FOR ROMERO'S 313 CLASS*****

I'd give Romero a 3.5 if I could, but that unfortunately is not an option. I've heard for many other classes, Romero can be a pretty bad professor, but for 313 he honestly wasn't that bad. In my class, he switched between giving us lecture slides and actually using the board to give notes, and he was pretty good at both. The examples he gave in class were very similar to exam problems, and his lecture slides were actually very detailed. His exams are also pretty fair and there was a pretty generous curve (85 for an A-). He also decided to drop two of our lowest homework grades at the end of the semester, something that was not originally on the syllabus, to help boost grades, so its actually pretty easy to do well in his class.

His homeworks can be quite difficult to solve, and the textbooks he recommends are practically useless in most cases. I would try and find a different textbook than the ones he recommends since if you can't figure out a homework based on his notes/lecture slides, you're basically screwed.

He is also pretty nice about exams. Before our first midterm, he personally led each discussion section to take questions from students about the exam. He also pushed our second exam back 2 weeks because students said it would help them prepare. Overall, I would recommend Romero for 313.",570
romero_danilo,4,A,ENEE303H,"I am surprised Romero has this many bad reviews. I agree that his course was really hard (hardest course I had in UMD), but he ""does not care if students learn"" is a COMPLETE lie. He set up extra office hours, moved exams and homeworks, and went over concept multiple times if we said we didn't understand them. Yes, the book is also ridiculously hard, but it is the accepted standard (Sedra & Smith) and it is helpful being taught at its level and not babied. So if you want the easy grade and the basic, take Franklin. If you want a challenge and knowledge, take Romero. A/D electronics is really hard - our TA considered our course way to easy and showed us some of his past assignments - if you want the easy way out, you will just be behind everyone else.

EDIT: So I took him for both 303 and 381. He was pretty good for 303. For 381, on the other hand, he was pretty lenient and didn't really teach much concepts, too much focus on just plugging in numbers. So take him for 303. Don't take him for 381 unless you are lazy.",570
romero_danilo,1,,ENEE600,"Horrible professor.  Clearly knowledgeable about material but does not care if students learn it and cannot communicate it effectively.  Exams and homework assignments almost always have errors he needs to correct, and he is almost exclusively available by e-mail, and only infrequently.  He absolutely ruined this class for me and I did not learn much from it as a result.  Avoid him if at all possible.  ",570
romero_danilo,2,,ENEE303H,"Single-handedly ruined my interest in a/d electronics. He's a nice guy, and makes it more or less impossible to fail his course, but I learned absolutely nothing. Lectures consist of long derivations that are usually not finished by the end of class or just straight incorrect. The assigned homework all consists of designing complex circuits from scratch instead of actually letting us practice basic concepts before hand. Also, the book more or less assumes you are some sort of electronics wizard going into it. You get a formula sheet for all of the exams, so you can pass by blindly writing formulas. ",570
romero_danilo,1,A+,ENEE303H,"You need the solutions manual to do any of his homeworks otherwise you won't be able to do any of them. And don't even try to study for quizzes...YOU WILL FAIL!!!! On the first quiz over half the class got a zero. He puts the textbook pages on pdf's and reads them to you in class. Complain to him about stuff though. He moved a test, canceled a homework and moved another homework because we complained. Oh and make awesome formula sheets. He doesn't have set office hours you always have to make an appointment. He never replies to email. He just plain sucks.",570
romero_danilo,4,A,ENEE380,"Dr. Romero's lectures are pretty well-organized and informative. The book he chose to use for the class was not the best, and although homework assignments were quite difficult, the exams were much more straightforward and fair. Not to mention there were many opportunities for extra credit; unsure if this will repeat for future classes. ",570
romero_danilo,4,,ENEE380,Good Professor. He explains the concepts well and the exams are fair. He will give sample exams that are similar to the exam but not too similar that you can just do a problem like you did on a sample exam. The only negative was that the homework was very hard and the discussion quizzes at least early on were difficult. Overall he is a good professor and I recommend taking him. ,570
romero_danilo,1,B,ENEE381,"This professor does not teach, but gives you slides with all the equations you'll need.  You probably will get an B or C b/c he practically gives you all the formulas for the test. His distribution is 100-90 A, 89-70 B, and 69-55 or 50 C. ",570
romero_danilo,4,,ENEE313,"Romero is a fair professor. You will definitely learn a lot out from his class, as his HW assignments are quite tricky. Lectures are not that useful as they focus on long derivations more than problem solving. For our class, exam questions were similar to past midterm he posted, except that a few questions had twists that you had to figure out. These twists were essentially included to test your understanding of the material. Good thing is the exams are open notebook.  ",570

romero_danilo,3,A,ENEE380,"I took ENEE380H with Romero. For one thing, I would like to note that the only difference between 380 and 380H in his class was a single relatively easy homework on our second homework set. So this class was essentially 380. I feel bad but I cannot recommend Romero as a professor; he is a very kind man but especially with online lectures it can be difficult to follow his teaching style, as it's often walking through a presentation with copy-and-pasted textbook slides. I skipped nearly every online lecture because I did not get much out of them. The tests were open note and many hours long (two of them were 36 hours) and were difficult but fair with that amount of time. I would argue that the tests should have been worded more clearly, but he's more than willing to clarify in email conversations. I did not have much trouble with this class but I did not get much out of it either except practice with multivariable calculus - the class was very math heavy and not focused enough on conceptual topics. ",570
romero_danilo,3,,ENEE303,"Dr. Romero is a really nice, easygoing guy, but he's not a good lecturer at all. His exams/assignments are somewhat difficult, but fair. However, he takes forever to grade exams, so you won't know your grade until way after the semester. ",570
papamarcou,5,B,ENEE322,"Papamarcou is a great professor.  I won't lie to you, this class is extremely difficult, but that is the content, not the teacher.  He does a really good job of explaining everything, and posted all of his lectures on elms in case you need to hear something again.
Homeworks were difficult and assigned once a week, but only a subset of problems got graded, and if your exam average was better than your overall grade with homeworks, then (if I read the syllabus correctly) homework grades get dropped.
Exams were fair.  There are two midterms and a final, each covering material from their respective unit.  The exams have similar problems to the homework, but are made slightly easier to compensate for the time constraints.
Honestly, this is just a really hard course with a lot of material to get a hold of.  If you can get Papamarcou, he will help you through it and you should get by okay.  This professor is a good idea.",572
papamarcou,4,C-,ENEE620,"I really like Papamarcou. He cares about his students and attempts to help them navigate his course. He is thorough in teaching the material and the homework is tough but you learn a lot. On the downside, his exams are super-tough and the scores you make on the exams make up 90% of the grade. So, while I learned so much in this course, my grade won't reflect what I learned, but only how I performed on the timed exams.",572
papamarcou,5,A,ENEE222,"Papa is a great lecturer and makes fair exams that can easily be aced by looking over practice and past exams. Only complaint is that he sounds like a book when lecturing (not a bad thing, but can be hard to understand sometimes with the terminology he uses).",572
papamarcou,4,A,ENEE324,"Great professor. Had him for both 324 and 241. He can be a bit verbose (tends to speak like a textbook) but always precise, which can be very useful for simpler topics but confusing for more complex ones.

He has a very fair grading scheme based on point values, which is nice since you know what you need to get going into the final. He is a very organized teacher, and studying for this class is not difficult due to his lecture notes and provided solutions. The only downside: if you don't understand how to do certain problems, his solutions can be hard to understand since he skips many steps, so they cannot be relied upon exclusively.

Overall, highly recommended as long as you are able to keep up with material as he presents it in class. I wish I had looked at notes for lectures beforehand, as that would have helped immensely.",572
papamarcou,5,A,,"Papamarcou is a great teacher. If your hcoice is between Papamarcou and Blankenship, CHOOSE PAPAMARCOU. I am speaking from first hand experience when I say you will have no idea what Blankenship does in class. I was in his section for the first week of classes, realized I HAD to get out, and switched to Papamarcou. Wow, huge change. Blankenship talks really quietly, and was doing some weird stuff when I was in his class. A week later, Papamarcou was still reviewing complex numbers and such.

His class goes at a nice, slow pace and he commonly stops to see if any student has a question. His exams are EXACTLY like his practice exams, so definitely get a hold of those. Also, his final is NOT COMPREHENSIVE. Some people think this is a bad thing, but I tend to think this is a great thing. Overall, this class is a breeze if you go to class, do the homework, and look at practice exams. Don't stress too much over the homeworks either, as he has a nice policy where if you do well on exams, homeworks don't even factor into the grade.",572
papamarcou,4,A,,"His lecture notes are very good. He also wrote his own textbook which is in .pdf so you can get away with not buying a text at all.

I found his lectures to be somewhat lacking in mathematical rigour to the extent that some of his explanations could have been more clearly and concisely been conveyed in a rigorous proof.

Study any test bank exams you can get, plus his practice exams. The curve is insane... I think 30-40% get A's or something like that. The exams are more about precision than anything else... just make sure you can plow through all the test bank exams without having to 'think' very much and you'll be fine.",572
papamarcou,3,D,ENEE425,This class was 10 times harder then 322. He doesn't make it any easier. If you don't understand his lectures drop the class right away.,572
papamarcou,5,A,,"Okay, yeah, I admit that I don't fully understand the DFT.

That article explains it well. Music is composed of many different instruments, and the DFT does what the human ear does. It splits the sound into the sounds made by different instruments.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObklYbQaX24

It's also basically another way to look at the same data, to see things you wouldn't normally see.

Okay, now for my review. I think Papamarcou is a really awesome teacher. Anyone who has ever taken Blankenship will tell you, ""I have no idea what I learned in 241."" Never take Blankenship. EVER. Unless you are like super freaking smart and I mean SUPER, you will have no idea what Blankenship is doing.

Papamarcou explains the concepts as well as possible. Just make sure you read the lecture notes, and skim the book sometimes. He's not that difficult, actually. I found this class to be challenging, but not impossible to get an A in. Also, like everyone else said, he cares a lot. That is really surprising because most of the ENEE2xx level teachers just don't care.",572
papamarcou,3,A,ENEE324,"i had papamarcou for 241 and 324.. while he is a good enough teacher, and i think that he genuinely cares about students and how they do, i really really REALLY hate the subject matter for both 241 and 324. not papamarcou's fault, but maybe it biases my review a little. papamarcou teaches like he is reading a book so it takes a good bit to get used to the way he describes things. ive done a lot better in 324 than i did in 241 i think because of that. either way, i think he is a little overrated. he might be better than the alternative, but he is a very very difficult professor. the workload that he gives you is a little unreasonable i think, but i suppose that his grading scheme accounts for that a little. ",572
papamarcou,4,,,"Very good professor, keeps you engaged. However he is frankly too smart, and the material is far to dense and nonsensical. Easy to get a B at least though. ",572
papamarcou,5,A,,"Even though I didn't come to many lectures and I never paid attention to the lectures I came to...I did all the homeworks and I was 100% fine.  I even bombed one of the exams and he disregards it.  It was awesome, I did work very hard for the final exam and I am very happy with him.  In person he is amazing and actually cares about his students. Def take him!",572
papamarcou,5,B,,"Great Professor, but the course content is horrible. Some of the calculations get really tedious and can be very confusing at times.",572
papamarcou,3,,,"Ok teacher, the course is just really, really, really boring. You learn all this computational stuff that you really don't understand. Like the other person said, you learn a 1000 ways to computer a DFT but never understand what a DFT actually is. 

He is helpful and nice. So take him if you get the chance. ",572
papamarcou,3,A,,"Papamarcou was an ok teacher. I found his exams to be pretty easy and I got good grades, but I didn't really feel like I learned much from the course. 

You will learn about 1000 ways to compute the DFT of a signal, but in the end, unless you are really smart, you won't understand what the DFT is. 

Basically this class is about becoming a computational robot and sometimes it's really annoying when you realize that you have no idea what you are computing or why you are computing it, even though you may be very good at computing it. 

Papamarcou himself is alright, although it often seems like he doesn't trust the students that much.

I think part of the problem is that the course is relatively new and needs a lot of tweaking. I hope for the future that he will teach fewer methods of computing DFTs and convolutions and such, and spend more time trying to get across the purpose of each step and what objects such as the DFT actually represent so students can know why they are doing these computations.",572
papamarcou,5,,,"Even though Papamarcou's class covered some pretty hard material, his method of teaching is awesome. He is particular with his examples and tries to fully explain each concept as he comes up. You don't have to buy a textbook, he gives you one for free on blackboard. Not only that, with each homework set he gives you 3-4 pages of notes that explain the material that the problem set covers. The problem sets were time-consuming, but the included notes were a godsend. His tests are tricky, so you have to prepare well. Great guy and a great professor.",572
papamarcou,4,B,,Really good teacher. He understands the material very well and communicates very well to students. He gives a lot of homework but without it there is no way to understand the material. I would definetly take 241 with Papamarcou.,572
papamarcou,5,,,"he was awesome, great teacher, just do the hw and listen to him and you will do fine",572
papamarcou,5,A,,"Easily one of the best professors in the department.  He is a great lecturer and his lectures are well organized.  The material he covers is tough, but if you can follow him and take notes (or get help when you need it) and complete his assignments you'll have every opportunity to do well.  ",572
papamarcou,4,C,,"He's hands-down a great professor. Not easy, but if you're looking for easy you're in the wrong major. If you care about your grade enough to see him every once in a while you'll be fine. He goes fast in lectures but he tries to explain things in great detail and simple explanations, and tells you what you do or don't need to know--he knows it's difficult material and levels with you. Nice guy too. ",572
papamarcou,4,B,ENEE222,Overall Papamarcous class is easy as you can do well in each exam by practicing his past exams which he posts on ELMS. However I feel like I havent really learnt anything from this class other than the MATLAB portion.,572

papamarcou,3,A+,ENEE222,"I have such mixed feelings about this professor. Clearly very intelligent and passionate about his work, however he just doesn't teach this class well. His new flipped-classroom-esque style is inefficient at best, and flawed at worst. I feel if he just did lectures in class instead it would be much easier to pick up on concepts. However, this is not my main beef with this class...

You don't need to study. Period. You can, but it won't give you a significant advantage over anyone else with a good memory and 6 hours the night before a test. He gives carbon copy midterms and finals every single year, and he gives you four to study from. I know multiple people who, after figuring out this trick, didn't study at all during the semester until the day before the second midterm and the day before the second final, where we just grinded and memorized how to complete the previous tests. And that's all you need to do, as we all ended up with A's. In my opinion, this is unfair as I feel like I came out of the semester not learning anything and with a grade that I don't deserve. It's just that if I'm handed a slice of cake, I'm not gonna run circles around it for three hours a day when instead I could just grab it and go do something else. Papamarcou, in my opinion, could restructure this class into something very useful if he changed the format of the exams and instead made them about understanding of material instead of solving memorization puzzles.

But hey, if you can memorize stuff easily and want a free A in a weed-out course, take Papa.",572
papamarcou,5,A,ENEE322,"Recommend taking 322 with Papamarcou if you didn't hate 222 with him. He does a flipped lecture that takes some getting used to if you haven't had him before, but he also has a text version of all the content so you don't actually need to watch the lectures if that's more your thing.
322 is hard. It's a lot of math-y computation, so not a lot of it is actually useful and applicable for stuff outside of school. 
Exams are pretty straightforward. Some questions may have twists, but they're mostly the same type of questions as in the practice exams. Homeworks are helpful for learning the content for each week/couple of weeks, but by the time each exam comes up there has been so much content covered that you'll probably just need to learn everything again even if you got the homeworks all or mostly right. He also uploads practice problems. Highly recommend just doing all of the problems and exams that he uploads.",572
papamarcou,5,A+,ENEE322,"Dr. Papamarcou is definitely one of the best professors at UMD. ENEE322 is a difficult course, but Dr. Papamarcou provides more than enough resources for his students to succeed. For every lecture in the course, he records 2 to 3 videos that go over the content in detail. He's great at explaining difficult concepts, both in lectures and in his videos. He also provides tons of solved example problems. If you put in a decent amount of work into this class, you will almost certainly get a great grade. Also, if you take ENEE322 with Dr. Papamarcou, you will most likely come out of it with an interest in signals. ",572
iliadis,3,A+,ENEE313H,"Iliadis is an okay professor. The way he approaches the class, at least in his ENEE313H class, was to give the students a really high-level conceptual understanding of all of the course content. He goes through tons of proofs on the board in his lectures, getting into the nitty gritty math behind derivations. However, he himself doesn't really do practice problems during class time. You'll have to depend on your TA or yourself to get practice problem help.

Homework was pretty light. He has this habit of assigning homework problems concerning topics that he hasn't covered himself in lecture yet, so I'd try to find a solution manual. 

Tests were in the format of half multiple choice, half free...response.  Multiple choice questions tested your high-level conceptual understanding of things, and in free response, some questions were also to test your conceptual understanding of the concept, qualitatively deriving behaviors and such. A small portion of the free response were actual calculations questions. 

The best way to study for his exams are to really understand the derivations in how to do them step by step, and what kind of assumptions are made in justifying each one. After that, being able to understand how to do some of the simple calculations problems that he assigns for homework, and you're good as gold.

There is a curve at the end. My grades on the two midterms were 86 and 87, and he said that I'm on track to get an A+ or an A if I slip a little too much on the final.

Edit:
This semester, I am also taking Iliadis for 303, and he teaches the beginning of 303 pretty much like 313. Our first exam for 303 could have been our first exam in 313 the semester before. He typically gives a quiz the class before a test, just to show you what you do or don't know. These quizzes don't count for that much, and he tends to recycle questions from them to put on the exam, so keep track of what the questions are.

",573
iliadis,2,,ENEE313H,"ENEE313, Introduction to Device Physics, is probably one of my least favorite ENEE courses. With that being said, Iliadis's lectures were pretty boring. There is not much structure to his lectures and he goes all over the place. The textbook he assigns is also very dense, and it is a pain to read. I actually would recommend taking Professor Goldman's course. Goldman wrote his own textbook for 313, and I actually ended up using it to study for the final as it was more straight forward than Iliadis's assigned textbook. Also, from Professor Goldman's website, he posts HW solutions and practice exams, which Iliadis does not do at all. I would have given Iliadis a 3, but once I went to his office to see my exam, and he ended up just regrading it and took an additional 4 points off. I was so baffled because he wouldn't even let me see my own exam, and he his grading methodology is so random. He literally said I took some points off here because I don't know what you were doing.",573
iliadis,2,A,,"413 is a complete waste of time. I took Iliadis for 313 and he covers the EXACT same material with same quizzes and same exams. He uses a different book though (Buy the international edition from ebay, it will save you a lot). If you are interested in device physics and want to learn something new I recommend 411, 419A, 489Q, or 496. The exams were pretty similar to those in 313, except a question or two that was harder. Some exam questions tend to be confusing. Often times he would say ""we discussed this in lecture"" when in reality he didn't really talk about it or blew off the explanation. He also tends to make people feel awkward, especially in a small class like ours. With that being said, I think he does care about us doing well. Even though his lectures are bleh you should still go and take notes because his exam will be based off of it.",573
iliadis,3,A,ENEE313H,"Iliadis is an okay professor. His lectures can be a bit boring but he isn't too bad at explaining the material. You realize he goes over the material pretty decently but you may not get a lot out of it. The workload is fairly light since there was little homework (I wish there was more HW to be better prepared for exams). Exams were pretty straightforward, there are simple computational questions, some derivations, and multiple choice questions. You pretty much have to remember the handful of formulas for the exam. He didn't give us back our exams for some reason, though the averages were really high. He is also disorganized and doesn't give very clear explanations. You need to read the book ahead of time to get the most out of his lectures. Overall, not a bad class and not hard to get an A. ",573
iliadis,1,,ENEE313,"I stand by most of the comments the other reviewers wrote, but I'll add one thing that may or may not discourage people from taking a class with this professor.  

I recently received a test back in this class, and doubted some of the point penalties I got on a few of the problems.  When I asked him what I should have done to get full credit on one problem, he looked at my answer and said, (his words, not mine), ""This is bull-s***.""  I was a little surprised, since I understand what ""B.S.-ing"" an answer means, and this was not a B.S. answer.  I proceeded to try and figure out why he didn't agree with my answer, but I'm just as clueless as I was before.  

I consider myself a good student, and I get that I'm not going to have the grades I want all the time, but I still don't appreciate my hard work on a test being referred to as ""bull-s***"".  I will try very hard to avoid taking any more classes from this professor, and I will personally recommend that other students avoid this professor as well.  ",573
iliadis,3,,ENEE313H,"Lectures are not really that interesting, although looking back, the material itself is pretty interesting as you are finding out what goes on inside stuff like transistors to make them work the way they do. 
The main problem with Iliadis is he doesn't explain stuff thoroughly enough. Many of his lectures require knowledge from other 300 level EE classes. 
This being said, his exams a very fair and he does not give much hw at all (I actually kind of wished he would give us more so that I could feel more prepared for the exams). The hw he does give is basically impossible to do solely from the lecture material. 
One nice thing was he emphasized knowing the concepts more than just being able to plug in numbers to equations. ",573
iliadis,3,A,,"I'm not sure why some people expected to use cheatsheets, when he specifically said no cheatsheets allowed.  You have to know the important equations for this class by heart and know some of the derivations.  Minus the second exam, he's required some type of derivation on every exam.

He tends to take points off your exam without really telling you why. (ie.checkmarks everywhere and a -10 points out of nowhere)

Don't even bother going to class unless you want to waste time.  He's incoherent and never finishes his sentences.  I don't think he's ever properly answered anyone's questions because he frequently goes off tangent.  Most of the time, he doesn't even bother to show up to class on time.  In short, his lectures are useless.  You'd be better off learning the material on your own.

I never took ENEE313 before taking this class, but from what I hear, the material from this class is same as the material in ENEE313.

Besides all the bad points, Illiadis is a fair professor.  He really wants people to do well in his class.  When a lot of people did horrible on the first exam, he gave us an essay to write to boost our first exam grades.  And during the second exam, when people kept asking him questions about one of the problems, he gave hints on how to solve the problem.",573
iliadis,4,B,,"If you take this class with him, expect to memorize every equation you need, and you will need a lot of them. The exams are not hard; if you know the formulas, it is literally plug-and-chug like a homework problem. This would have been nice to know beforehand, however, as he does not tell you this and a few people actally walked into the final expecting to be able to use a cheetsheet. If you don't know the right formula, you're dead in the water.",573
iliadis,3,A-,,"-Bad/boring lectures
-Late returning grades (when he grades papers himself, not the TA)
-Midterms have no comments on how he deducted points
-Often late to his own lectures

+Reasonably easy homeworks
+Midterms were fair and he reviews material
+Assigns extra credit if class average is low",573
iliadis,3,B,ENEE313,"Not a fan. Maybe it was the content, but I couldn't stay engaged in the lectures. He couldn't keep straight when homework was due and the exams (extremely formula heavy) did not allow formula sheets. I spent more time making sure I knew the equations than understanding the premise of the class. I can't recommend Iliadis for 313, take Daniels if he is available. ",573
iliadis,2,B,ENEE303,"Not a good professor. The class relied on memorizing formulas instead of using formula sheets which is not a good way to really learn the material, as the focus should be on learning how to solve circuit problems rather than plugging numbers into equations. The exams were very difficult to prepare for, as the HW that he gives is not what you would see on the exam, neither are the problems in the book. On top of that, he doesn't solve proper examples in class involving quantities, he just presents the formula and how he got there. Avoid if you can.",573
iliadis,1,,ENEE313,"Awful professor. I don't think anyone learned a single thing during lecture. Need to learn everything from the textbook, but still go to lecture because it helps for the exams. He was quite arrogant, and unresponsive to student needs. ",573
iliadis,2,,ENEE313,"Very, very few assignments to be graded off of. Lecture was very hard to follow and almost useless, learned almost nothing from it. Does not return your exams and takes quite a long time to grade them. Speaking of exams, good luck, as he does not release practice exams and they are nothing like the homework. No idea what my grade will be in the course, as he has not provided any criteria for curving whatsoever. Exam averages were 58% and 72% respectively. Final exam still has not been graded, over a week later. 2 stars instead of 1 because the workload was very light.",573
iliadis,3,A+,ENEE313,"First thing you should know about Illiadis is that he has no desire to teach.  He opens each lecture by asking if any students have questions from the current chapter (as if anyone has even looked at the textbook) and structures his lectures off of random tangents that are not cohesive whatsoever. 

Despite this approach to teaching, you can get an A in this class.

1. You need to go lecture.  Although lecture seems useless, he drops a lot of key information that will come up on exams/quizzes.  He hints to potential topics for free responses, multiple choice questions, and will state specific page numbers that are important. 
2.  You need to memorize equations and their derivations.  Leading up to a midterm he will emphasize a lot of topics that you should know VERY well.  He is explicit about which derivations you should know so there are no surprises, but make sure can explain every step.
3.  Read the textbook.  The textbook for this class is painful, but it is critical for the multiple choice.  You'll be surprised by the random information you'll retain just by skimming over the textbook once.  However, the multiple choice is not the end all be all.  It's usually about 15-20% of each midterm and the class is curved heavily.  He's also emphasized topics in class that I've seen come up in the multiple choice. 
4.  The numerical problems are very straight forward.  Make sure you redo your homeworks and look over the example problems for each chapter.  The numerical problem (singular) will be very similar to something you've seen before.

Overall, this class is not terrible if you play your cards right.  The homework is super manageable, typically 4-5 problems per homework.  I think we had 6 assignments over the course of the whole semester. ",573
aydilek,5,A,ENCE340,"Great guy. hE really cared. I didnt find the topic too interesting, but you can tell her really cared about the students. His tests were very fair. 
I wouldn't go as far as to say he made soil interesting, but he made it tolerable...

If I had to take another Geotech class I'd take him.",574
aydilek,5,,ENCE340,"solid professor. the lectures were powerpoints or just packets, but he was a pretty lenient grader on homeworks. his tests did have a couple tricks in them, but for the most part they weren't too bad. ",574
aydilek,5,B,ENCE340,"Excellent professor!  Teaches the material in a clear, concise manner",574
aydilek,5,A,ENCE340,"Great Professor.  This is my first semester here but he is my favorite out of all of them.  

Everything he teaches in class along with the power point slides, which are posted on blackboard, are all you need to know for the exams.  Equations for exams will be given.

You need the book for homework but he teaches everything you need to know.  

He is really good at teaching. He covers a ton of material but if you come to class, pay attention, and ask questions, he will ensure that you know what is going on.  If you don't ask when you need help and do bad, that is your fault.  If you ask him, you will understand.

Also he has actual experience with geotechnical engineering and relates everything to real life.

The second midterm and final get harder consecutively.  They won't be as easy as the first.  Know the concepts, not just the problems. He curves the final grade if the class average is too low so don't feel bad if you end up in the 80's at the end.",574
aydilek,1,C,ENCE340,"I'm to sure if this is because we moved entirely online or what, but this class is awful. The exams are literally impossible; he does not give us enough time on them at all. No mention of a curve yet, when the class average on our last exam was a D. I am literally a straight A student and this class is impossible. The homeworks are unfair and the textbook is of almost no help (the course content doesn't really follow the textbook, and you are expected to know things he only mentions once or twice in lecture that are not in the textbook). This class is making me question my major choice, even though I am a second semester junior. ",574
aydilek,1,P,ENCE340,"This guy is awful. DO NOT TAKE HIM if you have literally any other option for this class. This semester, we were entirely online, and all of his lectures were pre-recorded. Let me start off by saying he is such a stickler for academic integrity, we weren't even allowed to have a class groupme (even though all we used it for was helping each other understand concepts). He covers the bare minimum in class, and then expects students to be able to answer all sorts of trick questions on the homework. The HW is graded extremely harshly (averages were usually a 70 or below), and the exams are impossibly difficult and you are not given enough time. No mention of a curve, despite the averages for our first two exams being in the low 60s (exams are 85% of your grade, HW is 15%). This is one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken; you can watch all the lectures and take good notes and still not understand a lot of the concepts. If that wasn't enough, the textbook is disorganized and does not include everything you need to know. All of this, on top of no groupme (so no one has any idea what's going on), is a recipe for frustrated and dejected students. He should not be allowed to teach this class again online. This is the first class I have ever come close to failing, going into the final with a 70.1 (my GPA is a 3.85 for reference). You simply are not given the resources you need to succeed in this class. Honesty, im just thankful we have pass/fail this semester. ",574
duncan_james,1,B,ENME331,"Lectures were completely useless and nearly impossible to follow.  Spends way too much time on derivations and does not like going through example problems.

Duncan is a really nice person, but not a good teacher for 331.",575
duncan_james,2,A,ENME331,"His lectures are pretty difficult to follow. Throughout the semester I generally had no idea what was going on in lecture.

All he does is perform complex derivations throughout the entire lecture, everyone looks around at each other wondering what on earth is going on.

With regards to the class itself, it's not too bad you can look everything required from the homework.",575

duncan_james,4,A,ENES221,Dr. Duncan is a great professor for dynamics. His lectures are good (although a bit boring) and he is very open to questions during class.

411 is definitely a lot of work and in my opinion should be a 4 credit course, but this is not the professor's fault at all (the general engineering office is to blame).  Dr. Torrents always held office hours to help explain material.

She is a very good professor! ",579

She gives too much work because she doesn't run the class herself, its run my a possie of her incompetent, disgruntled, and frankly ***** TA's.  

Labs NEVER worked.  Not once.  We would be forced to write long lab reports that were 10 pages on the many errors involved in the lab.  Lab reports were weekly and took every group at least 10 hours a week to finish.

barg,4,A,ENEE322,"Took 322 with him in Spring 2011. Wasn't a bad class and the tests weren't too insane. Could've used a better TA, but what can you do.

He gives a substantial amount of homework, but he assigns it several days in advance. Don't put the homework off until the last minute or it'll bite you in the ass.

Make sure you understand the fundamentals of the new functions you learn like signal energy, power, delta and step - he's known to throw goofy test problems that you'll need to pick apart using definitions you learn in the first week of class.

I'd say he's above median in terms of teacher quality for this course. Better than Espy and Ephrimedes, at least. 

Also, he allows (or at least allowed when I took him) use of a sheet of notes for exams, but no calculator. This way you don't have to worry about mis-remembering a minus sign in a fourier table. You can also write down integral results that show up frequently.",580

He assigns a great deal of homework that has, on occasions taken me 15 hours per week to complete. Our largest homework assignment which was nearly 30 pages long when completed was due the Monday after Spring break. So much for my tickets to Vegas. He actively encourages students to drop the class but is very helpful at office hours. He sends out sample exams which look nothing like the actual tests, or the homework for that matter. Barg likes to focus on one small concept from the homework and then make the entire test about that so if you don't know absolutely everything there is to know about the material, you don't stand a chance on an exam. Also, he likes to structure his exams in such a way that if you can't answer question 1a, you can't answer anymore parts of question 1 so you lose 25 points right there. All in all, I'm not too happy that I chose this professor over Tretter.",580
barg,5,,ENEE620,"The best professor for taking ENEE620. There are a couple of major advantages: 
1- 620 is among the courses that contain a huge set of contents that is not possible to teach in only one semester. Thus choosing what to cover is very important. Dr. Barg is very good at this. I realized this after doing a great deal of research on that topic and also observing several offerings of the course over the years.
2- The set of assignments and the exams have a very meaningful correlation. You will not get surprised.
3- Rather than focusing on too much machinery and unnecessary ugly computational mathematics, Dr. Barg provides a lot of intuition to the core of the subject.

He refused to post cut off grades at the end of the semester and was not transparent at all about how grades were being determined.  He did not award grades on a fair basis, and projects of the same difficulty level were awarded wildly varying grades.  When I approached him with proof of the inconsistent grading he admitted that there were inconsistencies, but told me he wasn't going to do anything about it.

The labs are pretty easy which is nice but the midterm and final are terrible. His grading system is atrocious (he takes off more points if you get a question wrong than if you skip the question -- if you don't know, don't try. Great lesson to teach). He gives no review help for the final so you have to read every page of his notes and know every circuit and what they do. 

He also doesn't answer questions on things you got wrong on labs or finals. He simply says ""You did it wrong"".

winkelmann,4,A-,ENAE362,"I think the other two reviews are a little harsh. There are three components to this class: labs, the midterm, and the final. As far as labs go, it really depends on the TA grading them. I normally got low A's since the TA saw fit to just take off points whenever he felt like it (this was the case for most of the class). I got a 70% on the midterm which wasn't bad considering the average was about 54%. The final was very long, 24 pages, and tedious. 

The key to this class is to read the lecture worksheets you get at the beginning of the course, study the labs, and write down everything he says in class. He actually tells you some of the questions you are most likely to see by saying ""make sure you know this"" or ""this would be a good question for the final exam."" I couldn't believe it when I looked around and noticed that most of the people in the class didn't write anything down when he dropped us hints. 

The reason I gave Winkelmann a four is that he is a very good teacher who knows what he is talking about even though his grading scheme is a little evil at times.",584

His grading will seem pedantic for the first few labs but after a while you will get the hang of what he wants to see and everyone gets high As.  

The wildcard is the midterm and final.  The thing about his lectures is that he doesn't write much on the board so most people think they don't need to take notes.  Well that's wrong.  Make sure you write down every single word that comes out of his mouth because it WILL be tested!  I learned that the hard way.  Also the averages on the tests are really bad--below 50%.  He curves a lot so don't worry if you fail.  I got an E on the midterm and still ended up with an A in the class somehow.  ",584
winkelmann,1,,ENAE464,"Always gives at least 1 student a D, even if graduating senior.  Old, long-tenured professor who does not care about rules or policy.  Decent teaching ability, but when you're looking for a 464 class, stay the hell away from his.  Dr. Yu does not fail anyone, Dr. W is guaranteed to always fail at least one.",584
winkelmann,1,B,ENAE362,"Absolutely awful. It's unfortunate that he is the only option for ENAE 362 because it's a mandatory class. He makes this class much more difficult than necessary. The labs are pretty straightforward and actually educational. It's not too hard to score 100% on all of them if you closely follow the directions and turn them in on time. However, the exams are designed to be extremely difficult.  The average on the midterm was only about a 41% in Fall 2017. He gives negative points for incorrect MC answers, which makes already difficult questions worse. Basically, unless you are absolutely certain you are correct, the risk of answering a question is not worth  it. The exams are also difficult because he doesn't really do a great job of actually teaching the class. He reads the lecture notes verbatim and sometimes highlights sections that MIGHT be on the exams. Go to lectures and pay attention because this is the most helpful thing he does. If you don't go, good luck memorizing the entire hundred or so pages of lecture notes. 
He also does not post any grades whatsoever on ELMS. Students never find out what their final exam scores are. This is frustrating because the exam averages are so low. I would have liked to see my final raw score in the class to get an idea of what the grade cut offs ended up being. He pretty much just leaves students praying that the curve is big for the entire semester. The aerospace department is pretty obvious about not liking Winklemann's teaching style, but they can't do anything other than give him suggestions, which he clearly does not take. All they can do is offer their sympathies to his students.  I absolutely will never take a class with this guy again.",584
amde,3,A,ENCE454,"Only reason to go to class is to get the packets that he gives out. Tests come straight from the packets, which he spends a painfully long time going over during class. Test 1 and 2 are very easy. Final was very hard.
Also, throws a design project at you during the last week of the semester. Very time consuming and very hard. ",587

baz,5,B,ENES221,One of the best professors I have ever had. He teaches the difficult material very well and truly cares about his students. He is also funny and cracks a lot of jokes during class. You absolutely must take him for 221 or any other class he teaches!,591
baz,5,A,ENME462,Great professor. He takes his time going over the material in class and then in the discussions the TA reviews it again to make sure you really understand it. Exams are open book. Homeworks are generally tough and long but some problems come from the book. I would recommend taking Dr. Baz for any class as he is a great teacher! Very helpful at office hours and student concerns as well!,591
baz,5,A,ENME462,"Vibrations II managed to be much easier than Vibrations I, probably due to Dr. Baz. Well laid out lectures slides that guide you through the homeworks.  And there were just 2 exams, homework, and a final.  Exams were open book!  Take Dr. Baz!",591
baz,5,A,ENME664,"Dr. Baz made grad dynamics easier than undergrad dynamics. I took this class as an undergraduate and I was pleasantly surprised by the class material and Dr. Baz. What was taught in ENES221 was an okay introduction. ENME664 filled in many of the details that were missing and introduced far easier (if you can understand the math) methods to characterize the dynamics of a particular system.

Dr. Baz reviews the last lecture before each lecture. This is useful if you have missed a class and I think it helps me piece everything together mentally. He sometimes notes that he miswrote something last time and he'll correct it here too.

Unfortunately, the book he chose for the class is not very good, and he admits this numerous times. I didn't use it very often. I found what he discussed in the lectures and the lecture slides he posted (which he often did not cover specifically in class; the projector seemed to be used for when he was running out of time) to be sufficient for most work in the class. He will recommend a number of other books, with reservations. Most books don't seem to cover everything he wants to cover.

In this class I was introduced to what he calls the ""Augmented Force Method"" for constrained systems. This method is extremely powerful and allows me to directly find the equations of motion of very complicated systems with a great number of degrees of freedom. This method is relatively new and it is not covered in most textbooks. In my opinion, this method should be taught to all mechanical engineers and embraced as the easy way to do these problems. I highly recommend taking this class with Dr. Baz for this reason as I'm not sure if the other professors would cover this method. (If they don't, you apparently can read about it in Analytical Dynamics by Udwadia and Kalaba.)

His expectations were reasonable, but they were low in my opinion. I noticed that the syllabus listed many topics that were not covered. He seems to have scaled back the class to make it more easily doable. Even still, most students could not handle the work in this class based on what they've said to me.

There were 7 homeworks with 4 problems each. Generally these problems were straightforward if you could follow the lectures, however, there were some tricky ones. He provided reasonably detailed solutions to every homework problem and exam, so I could figure out what I did not get earlier. The homeworks can be rather time consuming, however, I got better at doing them quickly as the semester progressed.

He's a very easy grader. On several of my homeworks I noted that my answer was incorrect for X and Y and he still gave me 8 to 10 of the points out of 10! I think he wants to see that you understand the method and cares less if you get the same exact solution he does.

His exams are basically simplified versions of the homework problems. The two hour and quarter exams had two problems and the final had three problems. You can use ANYTHING you want to during the exams. Most students used laptops, but I found this to be distracting and clumsy, so I made some good reference sheets and remembered most of what I needed to know.

Overall, I'd highly recommend taking ENME664 with Dr. Baz.",591
baz,5,A,ENME361,"The man is the absolute best.  He teaches his class how every class should be taught.

Baz has never written an extremely difficult or unfair exam. Amazing professor, you can tell he really cares about teaching. ",591
baz,5,A,ENME462,"Dr. Baz is awesome. It will feel like you're not learning much, and his lectures can be super boring, but I felt by the end I had learned a decent bit about controls. The homework is insanely tough but he takes you through it in office hours. The exams on the other hand are crazy easy (as in you will get an A if you come prepared). My favorite thing with Dr. Baz is that he realizes you aren't going to solve a bunch of equations by hand in real life so he encourages using programs like MATLAB.",591
karlsson,5,A,CHBE497,"Has high standards, but is very open to working with students to help them. Works hard to help students work on specific interests within the class. Lectures are engaging and easy to understand. Exams are long but fair, and several past exams are given to help study",592

Exams in this class were not a joke though, probably because he held us to a high standard.  He would send us ""disappointment"" emails but it showed he cared about us getting better at the material. He curved us fairly and I somehow wound up with an A- even when I got D's on the 2nd exam and final.",593
tits,5,A-,ENEE322H,"Dr. Tits is an excellent professor who you should strongly consider taking if given the opportunity. He is very caring and kind; you will quickly discover his dedication to making lectures as insightful and informative as possible, often going *very* deep into the theory (at least for the honors version). That being said, I was a little disappointed by his apparent over-estimation of our abilities on the final exam - it was a shitshow, to say the least. 

Overall, Dr Tits is an excellent and very approachable lecturer who provided one of the most challenging and informative courses I and most of my classmates had ever experienced. The workload and amount of information can be daunting, even for someone like me who excelled in 222 and genuinely enjoyed the subject matter. If you can handle it, you will find this class to very rewarding in the end.",593

tits,4,A,ENEE322,"He is a great professor who really cares about his students. As others have said, he will make you work; he assigns homework every week, and the tests aren't easy. But he tries to give everyone a chance - in our class, when a lot of people did badly on the first two tests, he changed the grading scheme so that the lowest letter grade you could get was one grade lower than the final. In other words, he gave a lot of students another chance to shape up.

Also, if you do well in the class and talk to him in office hours, he'll gladly offer recommendations and suggestions for other courses to take. He is extremely friendly if you ask him questions that aren't directly related to the course, too.",593
tits,4,A-,ENEE322H,"His lectures could be somewhat hard to follow if signals isn't your thing (hey. We can't all be signals gods but we do all have to take 322). One thing is certain, though, he really cares about his students and wants them to learn the material. He is more than happy to help you if you show up to office hours.

Contrary to what some have said below, he is actually quite generous with grades provided you expend some effort yourself.",593
tits,4,,,"Although some may say that Professor Tits is ""pretty gay"" about some things, he is quite ""straight"" about working for his students' success.

If you're trying to get away with a good grade and don't care about the material, don't take one of his classes.

becnel,4,B,ENAE283,Good and fair. Somewhat boring. ,594
becnel,1,A,ENAE654,"The transition to online due to the pandemic was especially bad. He moved his lectures from live to pre-recorded. HIs lecture slides were very generic and did not go into depth on the mathematical nuances required to solve homework and exam questions. One exam question on the final was practically unsolvable unless you read a section of an optional textbook in-depth.

The class normally has a lab component where you construct a composite by hand using various methods. These were replaced with some arbitrary write-up assignments in which no rubric nor sample was provided to give guidance on the matter. What our team thought was a good term project write up (met all of his reqs.) turned out to be not good in his eyes. We received vague feedback on the assignment that didn't help us understand what we did wrong. 

Although it seems like Spring 2021 won't have the same issues, many of the problems I stated earlier are just exacerbated versions of his in-person teaching.
",594
becnel,5,,,"I have had Dr. Becnel a total of 4 times throughout my career in college, due to the pre-planned nature of the Aerospace schedule for Space Track. That being said, it's not a bad experience, he is very knowledgeable and will always say ""I don't want to be the professor to fail you and cause you not to graduate"" so that should tell you how he is. Very accessible outside of class, I would say he probably responds to emails within maybe 20-40 minutes after you send it.

For the first semester, when I had him for 423 and 483, I viewed him as a very intelligent, but dry and sorta boring guy that just taught basically like a textbook and so you always had the info you needed but not too much more. His style of lecturing involves presenting concepts and then having you think over a more difficult problem that involves those concepts at the end of lecture to discuss the next time class meets. Be prepared because he will award participation credit to those who write it out and actually do it.

For the second semester, when he taught 464 and was the lead in our 484 capstone, my perspective of him changed given the more personal interaction I had to have with him as the advisor for our project. I would say if you find him to be boring in lecture, it's probably because he's just kinda awkward and presenting in front of a large group for any awkward person tends to cause them to shift to an almost robotic state. You should go to his office hours (all the way in the manufacturing building) and just talk to the guy I think you'll gain new respect for him.

All in all, great professor, learned a lot, very fair with assignments and grading, although some of the assignments were pretty frustrating.",594
becnel,4,A,ENAE283,"Had him for 283 summer 2020, so the class was completely online. He gave synchronous lectures with a couple exceptions for prerecorded ones, but all were recorded.

ephremides,4,,ENEE621,"OK, two perspectives here: ""as your advisor"" and ""as your teacher"". This guy is a huge big-wig in EE, so having him as your advisor is gold. He's very knowledgeable and smart, and doors will certainly open for you. As your teacher, he follows the text, but he'll sometimes make typographical errors on the board during lecture, so if you actually read the material before class (which, admittedly, we're supposed to) you'll be just fine, but if you didn't then you can get lost (and you know how it is with math-intense classes: if you get lost on page one, you'll be lost for the rest of the class). Knows the stuff thoroughly.",596

Tests are straightforward but since he does a poor job explaining, it will be quite hard if you only go by his notes.
Homework did not count as part of the grade so all your grade are from his exams. He doesn't seem to curve a lot even though a lot of the class does poorly on his exams so don't take his class if you're aiming for an A.

Overall, he seems to teach with the sole purpose of lowering your GPA so I highly recommend choosing another professor.",596
ephremides,4,A,ENEE322,"He's a pretty awful lecturer, and it can be quite painful sitting through the class, but he makes up for it with his very simple and straightforward exams.

Homework from the book was optional, but highly recommended, as he considers your homework completion in factoring your final grade.

He's not the best (read: clearest) 322 teacher, but he may just be the easiest. The first exam had a tricky convolution, but the second and final were simple. It's easy to get discouraged due to his teaching style, but as long as you look over the provided homework solutions and remember the basic transform properties, you should be fine.",596
ephremides,4,B,ENEE322,He is certainly not the best professor. He do makes mistakes in the class. His exams are straight forward but his homeworks are time consuming. Overall he is not a great teacher and if you have a choice to pick up another professor I would highly recommend that you take this course with some other professor.,596
ephremides,2,,ENEE322,"It was unpleasant having this professor for ENEE322. I questioned his grasp on the subject frequently as he made so many mistakes during lecture that I was afraid to write down anything he wrote on the board. Half the time some student in the class would have to correct his mistake. Also, this did little to motivate me to come to class, and I believe it had the same effect on my peers because often times people would just get up and leave during lecture out of frustration.
Furthermore, if a professor shows little interest in a subject, his apathy is generally reflected upon the students. Specifically, the professor had unannounced absences at least five times during the semester. All these shortcomings may have been mitigated by a likable personality, but sadly Ephrimedes fell short in this department as well. He has a short temper, which manifests itself occasionally through his exasperation when students ask inane questions, to outright anger when people start to get up and leave during his lecture.

To try and stay at least a little impartial, I will enumerate the positive aspects of the course. I found his exams to be pretty straightforward and a good sample of the material covered in class. Nonetheless, the class average on exams tended to be pretty low, perhaps a result of his teaching style. Also, the homework was assigned judiciously and graded on completion rather than correction. As a bonus, he has a pretty cool accent. ",596

I once counted that he said 'um' 100 times in 15 minutes of class. Class itself isn't terribly hard, though. Pop quizzes suck and make you show up. The textbook uses WileyPlus which runs you about $90, and he seems to have stopped using it half way through. Smart man, with a big office. Too bad he can't teach, I feel bad for the ENMAs.",600
christou,3,A,ENME382,"Super boring lectures especially at 9 am.  It combined some aspects of chem135 and enes220, though mainly just chemistry.

shah_sahil,5,A-,ENEE303,"Dr. Shah is a really great professor, and this was his first semester teaching here at UMD. You can tell he really cares about his students.

makowski,4,,ENEE621,"His lectures are super clear; but you have to be in tune to what he's saying as you copy the notes from the board. If you listen, you can get a lot of intuition about the subject from what he says. The exams are not so much difficult as very, very wordy. You have to read about half a page of typed question, just to set things up. If I could have done his exams on a legal pad instead of those tiny exam booklets, it might have helped my organize my thoughts, but you end up flipping pages back and forth to make sure you're taking everything into account. And you do have to take everything into account, because usually you can solve the problem quickly if you realize that the assumptions allow you to simplify everything in a couple of steps. If you don't SEE that short-cut, then you'll really miss that legal pad.",602
makowski,2,,ENEE324,"Makowski is a snooze fest. Yet for some reason this dude does not allow a single phone out otherwise you will be personally confronted about it. If you whisper at the beginning of the semester, he will never let you forget about it. So let's recap: he makes us sit with our eyes glued on him for an entire hour and way too many minutes while he's up there being boring. Then, he explains the information in a really complicated manner and throws in new variables that no one has ever seen before and no one actually needs to ever see, so we are more confused than ever. This is the one class I can say that not attending lectures may have actually helped on the exam, and my friends' exam grades proved this point. 
I will give him kudos for understanding this material probably better than he knows his wife and children. He just thinks about what he wants to talk about and the material appears for him, it's pretty amazing. He unfortunately expects that out of his students. He also expects us to read the chapters before going to class. My recommendation: don't go to class. I am glad that by attending class I learned that my 13 years of Hebrew School taught me nothing because I had no idea how to say zero in Hebrew. My temple really failed me on that, just to add on to the failure I already feel every day thinking about this class. 
If you somehow find yourself with him as a Professor, he claims to not curve the class. You do get one formula sheet on the exams, but they won't help. Talking to him may help if you think you will fail, but do not expect an A unless you are one of those naturally gifted types. ",602
makowski,1,C-,ENEE324,"I have used ourumd.com for many years, as a lurker, mostly. I have never felt the need to review professors, because most of them at UMD are not noteworthy, in my opinion (not to say there aren't GOOD professors, just none that motivated me to write a review).

Until I had Makowski.

You see, even the shitty teachers are tolerable. Kruskal made algorithms the biggest pain-in-the-ass topic I'd ever taken before, but I got a B. Why? The class was still tolerable and DO-ABLE. But the same cannot be said of Makowski; he is on an entirely different level of shitty. A level of shitty that is politely cruel, convoluted, and irrelevant. 

The worst part about all of these things is that you don't realize this during the class. For most of the class, it just seems like you're not studying hard enough. It just seems like the hours of reading and rereading the book and meticulously going through every homework step-by-step, isn't enough. You've been studying for hours a day every day for seven days and you walk into that exam and it's as if you didn't study ONE MINUTE. IT'S AS IF YOU DIDN'T EVEN STUDY FOR THE RIGHT CLASS.

The level of math required for Makowski's exams goes beyond the prerequisite calc 2 level of math necessary for ENEE324. This is saddening to me, because I went the entire semester thinking I didn't study enough or didn't try hard enough, when the truth was that I didn't have the prerequisite bachelor's degree in math necessary for probability with Makowski.

Probability with Makowski was a time in my life where I questioned the following things:
- my major
- my intelligence
- my happiness
- my ability to do anything

If you have a minor in math or are double majoring in math, then this class should be a fun exercise of your skills.

Otherwise, stay clear of Makowski if you value your sanity, happiness, and GPA. 

On the bright-side, he's a very nice guy, and genuinely enthusiastic about probability. This is actually refreshing, but significantly overshadowed by all the negative shit. 


This class is the reason I started going to the counseling center on a weekly basis.",602
makowski,2,,ENEE324H,"This class was definitely an experience. There were only six people in the class, so, uh, if you're reading this Dr. Makowski, hello. Anyways, he's a decent lecturer, though my main complaint is that he sort of expects us all to be some level of mathematics wizards. His explanations are solid enough but when he starts doing example proofs I begin to contemplate my life decisions which led me to enroll in the ece honors program. The bi-weekly quizzes are easy enough but the grading is all over the place. 

A bunch of the test questions involve some arbitrary math trick which makes the question become super easy, which is great, because I suck at figuring sh*t like that out and end up with a grade that causes me to spend a thursday afternoon drinking my troubles away. The rest of the questions are multi-step, but the kind where if you can't do step one, you might as well end your miserable existence of a life because that makes the other parts impossible. Also the final was extended to four hours, because the we all agreed that probability is so baller that we wanted to have a double dose before we were allowed to go home.

I am proud to say that after passing this class the amount of information I know about probability is so little that if you were to give me a probability question I would solve it the same way I derive the first and second moments of the cauchy distribution. I worked really hard on that joke and it's bad but what are you a math major",602
makowski,1,B,ENEE324,"Here are the median grades for our tests this semester:
Midterm 1: ~50%
Midterm 2: ~25%
Final: ~40%

For overall grades, there was 1 A, 7 B's, 12 C's, and 6 D's. Spare yourself the trouble and avoid Makowski at all costs. He will tank your GPA, teach you little, and underhandedly insult the class when it inevitably does poorly. Test questions are typically either fairly easy or completely reliant on mathematical tricks that few people will get. Unfortunately, as should be clear from the grades, most questions are of the latter type, and he will not change that.",602
makowski,1,,ENEE222,"I heard that this course was hard but taking it with this Professor only made it harder. He likes teaching with little to no examples. It came time for him to teach some topics in Linear Algebra (a course I am familiar with) and he made it harder for others to understand by making easy tasks like LU factorization complicated. There are no practice exams for him in this course. He likes to form his own questions for exams which is good because it keeps you on your toes. He likes to ask exam questions that prove something. He kinda loses a little patience when you ask questions. If you have no choice but to take him, read ahead and practice a lot. It takes a certain kind of mind to understand what he wants from you during an exam so knowing how to do problems in the textbook won't just cut it.

Pros: will let you retake a quiz
Cons: Poor Teaching, Hard Tests, will cut you no slack about your grades (No extra credit, no dropped test, If you're failing before the drop date, drop it quick)",602
makowski,1,,ENEE222,"Makowski has personified the act of poor teaching. He focuses on the ""big picture"", which essentially means no concrete examples and instead you get proofs/the theory behind the approach. He expects a lot of mathematical know-how in order to do the homework/exams, so if you don't already have a B.S. in Mathematics, good luck. The textbook used was written by Adrianos Papamarcou, (whom you should register for ENEE222 with instead), and reading the textbook rarely helps when it comes to Makowski.

Lecture is the equivalent of putting your brain in a blender and leaving it on pulse for a good hour and fifteen minutes. On the bright side, it has reaffirmed my faith, for now I know that there is indeed a hell and chastisement exists in the form of these exams.

- Stay away, if you value anything in your life.

- If you need this course and this is your only option, invest in a high-quality bedspread so when you cry yourself to sleep at night your sheets aren't ruined.",602

babadi,4,B+,ENEE439M,"Very smart professor who is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Always friendly during lecture, provides clear explanations of the material with easy to understand examples, and covers everything on the exams, homework, and projects in class. However, if you do take ENEE439m, be aware that it is a graduate level course and you will be treated as such. For the projects (which are very fun and interesting btw) you are given a lot of freedom in terms of the implementation of the project, but as a result you are given little guidance. Coming into the class, I had little experience with MATLAB, python, or R and thus struggled in getting started on the projects. Grading in the class is fair, and if you put in effort on the homeworks, get the projects working, and study for exams like any other class, you can expect to get a good grade. Overall, despite having a few difficulties grasping the material (it is challenging stuff), and getting started on the projects, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot. I would fully recommend Prof. Babadi and ENEE439m to anyone interested in machine learning theory and application. ",609
pratt,4,A,ENES140,"This class is usually an online class but I had to take it in person since I was in FC. It is a complete waste of time to show up to class since all the material is online.

The final group presentation sucks. I had lazy group members and did all the work bc I really wanted an A. Any analysis I did with my ""group"" was terrible. The other assignments are cake though. Don't slack on those quizzes as I did; aim for perfects so you don't have to worry much of your group analyses and presentation.",610
pratt,5,A-,ENES140,"The FC version is by far an easy A class, and you don't have to always show up to class, though sometimes he would assign attendance activities. You have to communicate well with your groupmates and spread out the work evenly. Almost everything after the first unit is group-based, so make sure your teammates know what they're responsible for and when you expect them to finish it. Everything is really easy in the class, but it's based on luck whether you're assigned to a compatible group.",610
danielak,5,A,ENES100,A passionate teacher who cares dearly about his students. He is easygoing and tries to encourage student participation as often as possible.,614
danielak,5,A+,ENES100,A calm teacher who truly does care about you and your wellbeing. He teaches the material in an engaging manner and is pretty easy on grading.,614
danielak,5,A+,ENES100A,great teacher and fun course,614
danielak,2,A,ENES100,"He is very disorganized. He is calm and has good intentions, but when it came to Arduino, he barely explained it and blamed our not being able to learn coding on the ""virtual environment."" I went into his office hours for questions, and explained how I was struggling with coding (I have ZERO experience and this class kinda uses it second half) and he tried to write it off as I ""wasn't putting in the work"" and that ""as an ENGINEER i need to do things myself."" He also said comments like this directed to me in class. I felt pretty disrespected. Once I brought my concerns to him again in office hours two days in a row, I PROVED to him that we couldn't do a temp sensor because we didn't even have that piece in our electronic kit. In yo face. Don't be so rude, dude!

Another problem was the ASSIGNMENTS. EVERY SINGLE TIME something was posted there was ALWAYS an issue with it. Literally. I had to email TAs and Dr. D continuously. Statements were unclear. Deadlines got switches. New rules announced days beforehand. It was annoying. I did a whole assignment and they decided it wasn't going to be graded and forgot to tell us.

Overall, he is very chill... maybe too much. Class was very boring with little work. I feel like I got nothing out of it. The students in there were kinda uptight too. Dr. D is ok at lectures and keeping student interest. I wish we had more EXCITEMENT and FUN and learning to actually code!",614
danielak,5,A+,ENES100,"Very nice professor and very accomodating. This class will be easy for most engineering students and points are largely given for completion rather than quality. There are a few assignments for which students unfamiliar with Arduino or material failure may need to look up some coding/wiring help or some formula, but this is allowed in this class and is very easy to do",614
danielak,2,A+,ENES100A,"Dr. D is very disorganized and the class as a whole was on and off. We always seemed to run into issues with deadlines and communication. I visited him during office hours and he helped some, but he really doesn't have a lot of energy. I feel like I was never heard in the class. We were left to teach ourselves most of the knowledge, specifically with Arduino, which isn't ideal since I have little to no experience with it. This was an online class for me and I can firmly say they did not transition the projects well to the virtual environment. We had group projects that almost demanded us to need to be physically together. The class was just very messy.",614
danielak,4,A+,ENES100,"He's great. Very accommodating, patient. Arduino coding was a challenge for the less experienced and the projects were annoying but he always tried to help. We had a hard time with our code for an assignment, and him and the TAs were very patient and walked us through it until we got it to work. He does put some focus on being able to troubleshoot issues and do your own research to solve problems, but he's also available if you are really stuck. ",614
jacob,5,A+,ENEE350H,"I took this class in the fall of 2009 with Jacob. His teaching style is so interesting and engaging that even if you don't go to your classes, you'll want to go to his. He will go out of his way for students and he will also teach you about topics that YOU can pick because YOU find it interesting! The class was pretty easy but it was intellectually stimulating - it was only easy because Jacob is really a great professor, so I'd give him a lot of credit. You will learn a lot and really enjoy the class with him! :)",615
jacob,5,,ENES100,THE best professor for ENES100. He will basically tell you what parts are best for the hovercraft so pay attention. His lectures are also the most interesting. Just don't expect him to help you study for the midterm. The TA was much more helpful for answering questions. ,615
jacob,5,,ENEE350H,"This guy is the best professor I've had at UMD hands down. He's one of the few professors that still understands what it means to be a student, so he'll teach you stuff you actually use after you graduate. I wasn't lucky enough to have him for ENES100, so when I saw he was teaching this class I immediately jumped at the chance. If you ever have an opportunity to take him, DO IT. You will not regret it.",615
jacob,5,A,,This guy is an excellent professor. He knows what he is talking about and genuinely cares that you learn from him. There are very few professors that are as good as this guy. I took this class (electric guitar design) for fun (which it was) but I hope to get Jacobs again for future classes. ,615
jacob,5,A,ENES100,"From what I know, he was much more relaxed than the other teachers. The only issue I had is that I didn't really learn anything until right before the mid-term. If you're trying to learn you might want to take another section. He's easier and his TA (who happens to be a very cool person) can help you however. It really depends on what you're looking for.",615
jacob,5,,ENES100,"Take Prof. Bruce Jacob at all cost! He is probably the coolest engineering professor in the Clark School, and is very lenient with grades. He encourages thinking outside the box, and tells you not to worry about your grade. Also, he always teaches with the same TA,(whose name is AJ by the way) and the guy is awesome. Either Jacob or AJ will help you out in anyway they can. Also, he will defend his students when other people in the department criticize ideas etc. Take this guys if you can!",615
jacob,5,A,ENES100,"Great teacher! Absolutely does not care if your hovercraft breaks down as long as you put in effort. He loves getting off topic and cares a lot about helping you get the point of the class (which is : team projects are hard). As for the midterm, you'll do fantastic if you've taken some physics classes before. If not, get good at writing cheat sheets-you're allowed one page.",615
espy-wilson,1,B,ENEE322,"She moves very quickly through the material and does not care if you have questions. Also, the exams are nothing like the past exams, so study everything. If you miss class, she basically recites the book word-for-word, so you will be fine if you just read the book. I would definitely recommend avoiding her.",619
espy-wilson,2,B,ENEE322,"Professor Espy-Wilson is a really nice person but like all the other reviews the test are nothing like the homework's or quizzes, if you need help understanding the material i would definitely go to the TA's. The test averages are very low and there is a curve at the end of the semester so if you wanna know how well you're doing you have to go to her in person. She teaches the lectures pretty well since the book is old and some of it is hard to understand. I would avoid her if possible mainly because of her tests, but if you know the material very well you should do well with her",619
espy-wilson,4,,ENEE322,"Pros:
Good lecturer, although she goes a little too fast most of the time and seems stressed out sometimes
I really liked the idea she had of how the course should be taught. She emphasized visual understanding of the actual concepts and practicality of problems, rather than just doing math without context
She does curve the final grades

Cons:
She does not put enough time into other aspects of the class outside of lectures. For example, she has the TA make the quizzes and HW's, which ends up meaning that it's very hard to be prepared for her tests, which she makes. This is the first EE class I've had for which the TA assigns the hw rather than the professor, and it is definitely a bad system
She has a tendency to put people on the spot during lecture, which can be very uncomfortable
Her grading of exams is shoddy at best, and she is reluctant to give more points on regrades. Often her grading mistakes or poor exam questions are based on mistakes or confusions that are present in her lectures

Overall I think that the way she teaches the material is very true to the engineering spirit and makes up for most of her bad points, but you must be prepared to be frustrated at your grades sometimes. It is possible to do well in her class though with lot's of studying and hard work. Make sure you can do problems quickly too since the exams are too long for the given time sometimes",619
espy-wilson,1,,ENEE322,"Although she is a very nice person she does not care much about student concerns. Lectures help the homework but they have almost nothing to do with the tests. Sample exams are nothing like the actual tests either.  Exam questions are hard to understand since they pop out of nowhere. Overall, she is a nice person but she makes the class way too hard and towards the end of the semester you feel no motivation to take more signals classes.",619
espy-wilson,2,B,ENEE322,"+ She is a nice person. 
+ She is very clear during lecture. 

- Her exams are nothing like previous exams, homework, or anything that she does in class, which makes this class very difficult.",619
espy-wilson,4,A,ENEE322,"Overall, this professor is very clear in teaching the basics in signals and systems.  Her tests are difficult(not that the subject isn't) and long so your going to have to do more difficult problems for practice.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.",619
espy-wilson,2,,ENEE322,"Extremely nice, very knowledgeable, and actually pretty accommodating, though she does not like to give points back so don't even try. The tests are worth 90% of your grade, so you should probably do well on them right?
Too bad! The tests are nothing like the practice ones and the hw was given by our TA, so it wasn't really that helpful to learn what to expect for any exams. The practice midterms she gave left me pretty confident of doing well, only to get absolutely blindsided by something i've never seen before.
If you're thinking that it's just me, consider this: The average for midterm #2 was a 39%, with a low of 2.5% and a HIGH of 59.5%. Not even one person was able to get >60%. To make it worse, she said this was an IMPROVEMENT from the last semester! Though she says she curves heavily, so hopefully that can rescue literally all of us. Based on what she said in class and office hours, it sounds like she really wants students to come to her office hours, though they seemed to me to be of marginal benefit.

When it comes to 222 or 322, take Papamarcou. Period.",619
espy-wilson,4,B,ENEE322,"Professor Espy-Wilson is very nice and I feel like she gets a bad rap, though these other reviews are certainly accurate. In office hours, she was very helpful and accomodating. She teaches fast, but it's all in the book, and she's more than willing to help if you're stuck or confused. Make no mistake though, this is a very difficult course, and her tests make things very frustrating. That being said, the whole class was curved (pretty heavily actually), so the end grade is pretty much just a representation of how well you did compared to your classmates. From my experience, here's how the workload was: Studying like any other class will earn you a C; Studying very hard (or in my case, harder than you ever have) will get you a B, and selling your soul to the Signals Gods gets you an A. The tests are impossible, so much so that even those people who usually get 99% on an average of 50% were also doing poorly. 
All that being said, if you just care about a grade, Espy-Wilson is not for you, it might be better to put this class off rather than try to suffer. But if you want to master signals, than she is for you. IMO someone who got a B with her likely knows more than someone with an A in Papamarcou. I consider it a high risk, high reward class, so take it ONLY if you are willing to 'do the gauntlet'.",619
espy-wilson,4,A,ENEE322,"Prof. Espy-Wilson is an amazing teacher, as in she is very good at teaching the material in a way that makes sense. Unfortunately, she gets a bad reputation because her exams are challenging. However, if you study the old exams, which she will provide and go over, you stand to do very well on her exams. Additionally, make sure you clarify any doubts or questions as soon as they arise; concepts in this course build on each other and poor understanding of earlier material will most definitely become a problem down the road.",619
hamel,5,,ENES232,"Really just an all around great professor. She's extremely friendly and helpful, and does her best to make sure her students succeed. Her lecture is easy to follow and engaging.",620
hamel,5,C+,ENES232,"One of the best professors I've ever had, she took one of the most dreaded engineering courses and made it approachable and enjoyable. You can do well in her class as long as you put in an honest effort, but be aware that there is very little curve for the class so you have to do well.  I wish I went to lecture more, she even brings candy sometimes. There are so many nuances to this class that even if you do well on the homework,  you can still mess up the exam due to small things. Make sure to show up to lecture to learn the tricks around these nuanced things",620
hamel,5,A+,ENES232,"Professor Hamel is one of the best professors in the Maryland capstone department. She, not only cares a lot for her student's success, but has the capability of actually teaching her students, allowing them to be successful. Also, a very engaging professor. If at all possible, take this professor for any engineer course possible.",620

But Thamire teaches in such a clear, methodical way, everything seemed to make sense. He is a great teacher, is really helpful in office hours, and is really fair. That said, it's a really hard class and requires a lot of work and practice, but Thamire is the guy to take it with.",621
thamire,5,A-,ENME371,"The most important required ME class in my opinion.  Thamire should be teaching this class forever, because he does a great job.  Also i was SURE that i had a B+ in the class but managed to get an A, despite him saying that there is no curve in the class, he tends to bump you up if you are really close.",621
thamire,5,A,ENME371,Prof. Thamire is an incredible professor.  He is knowledgeable about an incredible variety of topics and is very dedicated to ensuring you learn the material in his courses well.  Very nice man and an excellent professor.,621
thamire,5,,ENME371,"Dr. Thamire has got to be one of the nicest professors. I had him for both ENME 371 and 221. He is incredibly intelligent, helpful and fair. He will work you hard but you'll learn alot. Oh, and the elephants that he draws are hilarious. 

Be warned, ENME371 is an incredibly demanding class, it's more like a 6 credit class. It's not necessarily hard, just time consuming and the reports can be somewhat tedious. Make sure you get a section leader who's there for you and fair. I have nothing against Dr. Das personally but he's far too occupied in other things to be a section leader for this class. His grading was largely unclear, unfair, and took FAR too long. The report and presentation grades for other sections were far higher... bear in mind that this class is not curved.

",621
thamire,5,A,ENME371,Dr. Thamire is one of the Best engineering teachers I have had at the University of Maryland. I would recommend him over and over to anyone looking to take his class. I wish he taught the lab portions of the class as well because he straight up front helps you with ANYTHING you can think of. He even will adjust the class schedule with what is going on in other classes during the semester. Hands down my favorite professor ever!!!,621
thamire,5,A,ENES221,"If I had a choice between Kiger, Sandborn and Thamire I would definitely choose Dr. Thamire.
The reason Thamire is the best is because he genuinely strives to help his students not only to learn the material, but ASLO to get a good grade in the class. 
Show him that you care about the class, and he will help you!",621
thamire,5,A-,ENES221,"Dr. Thamire is a really nice, approachable guy and a good teacher.  Dynamics is a difficult class, but if you keep up with the homework it is manageable.  He really cares about his students and wants them to do well, and even though he says he doesn't curve, there are a number of extra credit opportunities that raise your grade just as much.  I recommend going to Keystone for this class, I would not have survived without it.",621
thamire,5,A,ENME371,"The class is not hard, per se, but is extremely money and time intensive. You will find that 3-4 times during the semester you will be pulling all nighters to get papers done on time, or spending a large amount of time studying for quizzes on material that was briefly mentioned in class, never to be seen again. The review for the final was also lengthy, covering the majority of the 800 page textbook.

The benefit of all this? You WILL be rewarded for all of your hard work. He grades quite generously and gives several opportunities to fix mistakes. Extra credit quizzes are nice too. The material was sort of iffy for me, but the design project was rewarding in the end. Good guy, good teacher.

As an extra note, if you have the choice, get Thamire as your section teacher and not Aris Cleanthous. Aris knows what he is talking about and is knowledgeable, but is difficult to get a hold of and imposes his own arbitrary limitations to reports than what Thamire does. For example, on a Design for X presentation, Thamire's section only had to do a report on a single part, while Aris required two parts to do. The end result being each team rushed through the presentation and went well over the time limit. Not fun.",621
thamire,4,,ENES221,"Dr. Thamire was a really nice professor and I'm really glad I had him for dynamics.  Dynamics is a pretty tough course and the homeworks can be time-consuming.  Yet both exams and the final were relatively easy, just make sure to go to the reviews beforehand.  Dr. Thamire really wants everybody to do well and as a result gave a bunch of extra credit.  At the end of the year we took a 15 point extra credit quiz that nearly everybody got a 100% on.  Then, he doubled that to 30 points and added it to our exam scores.  I highly recommend taking Thamire for 221.",621
thamire,4,B,ENES102,"Good professor, knows and teaches the material well.  Extremely nice guy, easy to talk to if you have any questions in or out of lecture.  Exams were fair, not my favorite, but not really hard either.  Take him if you want to get through ENES102 without hating the class at the end.",621
thamire,5,A-,ENES102,"Dr. Thamire is a great statics instructor. He really knows the material well, and makes himself very available if you have any out-of-class questions. Also, lots of opportunity for extra credit in his class.",621

thamire,3,,ENES102,"Decent professor, he does his best to try and make you understand the material. Lectures were really really really really boring. I hated discussions because the questions were always too difficult to answer. His teaching style kind of got sloppy towards the end of the semester. And he does other little stupid things that I didn't like. I suggest try getting a professor like Beigel but if you end up with Thamire, it won't be too bad. ",621
thamire,5,A+,ENES102,By far the easiest statics teacher.  He will love you as long as you appear to try hard.  His voice can put you to sleep though.  Hope you get this guy for ENES102.  ,621

thamire,3,A,ENME400,"Thamire is a really nice guy and is sorta funny sometimes (without trying to be), but he is immensely boring in lecture.  Furthermore, the project for 400 is absolutely absurd and he does not teach or explain the concepts well.  If you can take the class during the winter or summer I would because outside of the project the class is super easy.",621
thamire,1,B+,ENME406,I hate him so much. His courses are a disgrace to this university.,621
thamire,4,A,ENME400,"He kinda took academic integrity to a whole different level. We had to show our exam papers on zoom 5 minutes before the exam is over, which a lot of us forgot to do because we were trying to finish up the exam. And he tried to punish the students who genuinely forgot to do so. I understand where he is coming from but it was kind of anal.
Did not want to upload his zoom lectures because he worried about ""lower viewership"". I think he should have uploaded the recorded lecture even if it costs the amount of the viewership. The learning outcome is more important and students could greatly benefit from recorded lectures especially for courses like this.
Explains concepts really well but sometimes repeats very basic things over and over every lecture. Nice guy and very pleasant to interact with.
400 is a hard course but he probably could do it better than anyone else. I'm glad that he taught us 400.",621
thamire,4,A,ENME400,"I love Thamire, but this class is painful at times. He does a great job with drawing figures and is honestly a pretty good teacher. Despite going really fast, you never end up covering as much as what is lined out in the syllabus. The homework is fine, the studio assignments are a tedious but doable group project, and the exams are reasonable but a time crunch.",621
thamire,5,,ENME400,"Dr. Thamire is a great teacher who is always open to questions and wants to help students. While it might take some time to get used to drawing some of the figures he draws (he is basically an artist), overall, the class is very well-taught. As for the workload, it definitely is manageable. Exams were fair and reasonable. ",621
healy_liam,3,A-,ENAE441,"Not a great professor. He doesn't really teach and his exams can cover any number of topics that you probably didn't study because he did not go over it in class. Good luck.

Less of a review of Healy: Take the aero track because you will avoid Akin. If you want to do space in your career going aero will still be the better choice.",625
healy_liam,2,B+,ENAE441,"Not a good professor. Just reads from his book, which is not very well organized. You spend a lot of time re-learning material from ENAE404 in ways that are a lot less clear. Exams are open book but unfair and include material not covered in class, in the book, or in homework.",625
healy_liam,2,B+,ENAE441,"Dr. Healy is one of those professors who I think splits their time between being a professor here and working at a different location for research/testing. He therefore, albeit very responsive to emails and was very reasonable with me to his credit, seems to be less focused on teaching, which comes across as he simply writes main points from his textbook on the chalkboard as his lecture style. Homeworks in this class are typically deviously simple, where you will absolutely trip up is on the midterm. No amount of studying helped me significantly with that midterm and it really caused quite a stir in our class once grades were released. He isn't the best professor in terms of conveying the material in his book, and often times the concepts that were pretty well defined in 404 become a lot more confusing. This is especially true for HCW relative motion maneuvers (not the state definitions, calculating delta-v here is not in his textbook and the method he presents will only become clear to you once you do it a few times) and once you get to probability and Kalman filters and least squares it gets kinda wild. 

All things considered though, the class content is interesting, and if you're one of the people who completely bombs the midterm outright there is a slight chance you will have the opportunity to take the much more lenient and simplified version taught by Dr. Marcus",625
hartzell,4,,ENAE601,"Overall good, straightforward professor. Teaches the main concepts needed to know for homework. You will need the Vallado text to understand more in details since she tries to cover many topics (even though it's not required - highly recommend). 

She picks low hanging fruit with grading. Most grades came in at the very last day/day before final grades were due (as with many AE professors). For the report she didn't provide a rubric and graded on her arbitrary thoughts on how you should have done your report.",629
cadou,1,,,"Worst Fucking professor ever!!! If I could give him negative stars I would. He thinks that he is the shit and has the biggest stick up his ass, when in fact he is shit. Seriously, this man cannot teach and for keystone classes like ENES100 and 102, I reccommend you stay away from him at all costs. He is way too theoretical and expects you to grasp everything the first time and also expects you to know everything. He is also very condescending and full of himself. If I could ask the University to fire one professor, it would be Cadou. He has no right to teach at a top 20 engineering school",631
cadou,4,A-,ENAE311H,"Dr. Cadou is probably the nicest aerospace professor I have ever had. His class, however, is pretty difficult. His lectures normally reduce your brains to mush, but the textbook does help clarify the material. I had quite a few mishaps in this class, but I somehow managed to scrape an A-. 

Homeworks consist of book problems and some of his own problems. The book problems are always very easy, but the ones he makes up are often difficult. I strongly advise working with a friend in this class because two people are more likely to figure it out than one person. 

Midterms and Exams are difficult. Before the exam, he lists the topics on the exam and then puts a star next to the most important ones. These, ultimately, are the concepts that end up on the exams, so make sure you know them front, sideways, and backwards. The best preparation for the exams is reading the class notes and reviewing all your problem sets. ",631
cadou,2,A-,ENAE311H,"His lectures were really hard to follow because he just writes down complicated formulas on the board.  Luckily you can use examples in the book to help you solve HW problems.  For the honors section he teaches material not covered in the book and that's where you get screwed.  

Overall I didn't enjoy the class that much.  I didn't learn anything and the only reason I got an A- was because of what I remembered from ENAE283.  It may have been the material, the way he taught it, or a combination of both.  I don't really know.  ",631
cadou,3,C-,ENES220,"Cadou is very average in all respects. He sometimes forgets to cover certain concepts in class which make the homework difficult. Nonetheless, he is organized and does not mind helping you in office hours. But overall, he is neither good nor bad; just average.",631
cadou,3,A,ENAE311,"Cadou's lectures are hard to follow because he spends a lot of time deriving complicated formulas rather than doing any actual examples. 
The homework assignments for this class were very time consuming and difficult.  A few times I compared my homework assignments to the ones for the H section. The were almost the same, but ours had additional problems that added a lot of difficulty. The regular section should not have had HW harder than the H section. 
The exams were pretty easy and made up for the difficult homework. As long as you know which formulas to use, they're not hard. Some of the problems on the midterm were exactly the same as the weekly review problems. 
Cadou grades by giving the person with a the highest grade in the class a 100% and adds that percentage to everyone else's grade. I had an 89% after the final and ended up with an A.",631
cadou,4,,ENES232,"Cadou gets a bad rep but from my experience, he's not as bad as people make him out to be. He goes over MOST of the concepts which is usually good enough and prepares you decently enough for exams if you actually try in discussion and re-do the homeworks, etc. ",631
cadou,4,,ENAE311,"Cadou is an okay teacher, but he definitely has a lot of other commitments which shows through his grading timeline/resources provided. His lectures are fine to follow, but good luck if you're just looking at the pdf because his handwriting is pretty hard to read without him talking along side it. It took him over a month to grade our first exam and we finally received grades after the withdrawal date. The average ended up being in the 30s, so this was very concerning for class. That being sad, he did allow us to retake the exam (had the weekend after we took it to turn it in) which helped to boost the average. I think he took feedback from the first exam EXTREMELY well when writing the second exam. It was much more manageable time-wise & point distribution was more even across questions (45 pt question on the first exam that most people failed). Since the withdrawal date had been pushed back this semester, he promised to have exam 2 and other assignments in by that date (which was less than a week over Thanksgiving Break) and he fulfilled that promise. 

All in all I think he's a pretty decent professor and does really care about his students. I think he can just be a little oblivious to flaws in how the course is managed. If you put in the work the class really isn't a problem class.",631
martins,5,A-,ENEE324,Very fair and reasonable professor. He extends deadlines if needed and pretty good at teaching the material. He is a little vague though on what is on exams sometimes until a few days before so you have to ask him. But if you end up taking him you will be fine. 324 is in general a hard class due to the concepts. ,633
martins,1,,ENEE324,"It's the last day of classes, and we have just been told that grade cutoffs have still not been determined; not even a vague prediction was given. Since this is the last day to decide whether you want to drop or do p/f, this is a little problematic. At the very least, it would be good to have some expectation of the C- cutoff, but even that is too much. The way exams in this class go, I don't even have an idea of whether the final will end up with me getting an A or D. In short, this is the most uncertain grading system I've ever had to deal with, which has caused me some frustration. The only clue I have is that we're graded based on how the overall class does, but that's not enough to work with. Does the average performance in this class merit a B? A C? Who knows? I don't even know if the minimum for a C- might somehow end up being higher than a 70%.

In my opinion, the concepts we are tested on are not always adequately explained in class. I understand that these concepts are difficult, but you'd expect midterms consisting of 10-11 multiple choice questions, 6-7 of which are true/false, to go fairly well. This was not my experience.  Some questions certainly feel unfair in the topics they cover or the edge cases we need to consider for the true/false questions. This is already a difficult class to conceptualize, so this does not help matters. Ironically, luck is a significant factor on these exams. I'm not certain why Martins believes a large grade distribution is a good indicator of people's knowledge relative to each other when even he acknowledged that the benefit of all-or-nothing multiple choice questions is the ability to guess.",633
martins,1,P,ENEE324,"I took this class online and his grading criteria is a strange, to say the least. He mentions how it is based on what the class on average gets, so there are no hard traditional cutoffs like 70% being a C-. So the cutoffs can move up. The exams are unreasonable. There are 10 true/false and multiple choice problems worth 10 points each, and missing one problem means losing 2-2.5% of your entire grade, which is silly. There is no partial credit so it may as well be you just guessing an answer (which is pretty ironic for a class on probability). You don't know your grade throughout the semester, so even if you have an 85%, that doesn't really mean you have a B if the rest of the class was doing better than you.

In terms of teaching, it is easy to follow what he teaches in the class. He is a decent lecturer. But what he asks on the exams is very different from what he teaches. Lectures are usually derivations of formulas but the exams require you to make a lot of assumptions to use those formulas, but those assumptions were not covered in the lecture. Problems during discussion sessions were examples from the textbook, so they don't do an adequate job of preparing you for what Martins is going to ask you on the exam.

Only take this class with him if you have don't have a lot of workload so you can study a lot of probability material outside of class to do well.",633
martins,1,P,ENEE324,"First time reviewing a professor because the structure of this course and exam format is so bad that I had to say something. The format of the exams is covered in other reviews and I can confirm they are as bad as people said. Exams are worth 75% of your final grade, but about 60-70% of the exam is true or false problems that seem to be designed to trick you. That means that roughly 50% of your final grade is determined by 21 true or false questions that you may as well guess on. The actual problems are very different from what is taught in class and the homework assignments so it is hard to study for the exams as some of it is stuff that is vaguely related to what you've been doing, so doing practice problems from the book doesn't seem to help. He is a pretty decent professor, however, but he does not prepare you for what is on the exams. Since classes are going back to being in person the exam format will probably change so it could be better the following semesters. I would not recommend taking this course with Martins with his current course structure and exam format.",633
gomez_romel,5,A+,ENEE205,"Gomez is a guy that is as passionate about teaching as he is about circuits. He puts so much energy into his lectures that it makes me feel out of breath by the time his lecture is over. He cares about his students learning, and is a great help in office hours. He also holds extensive office hours (something like 6 hours a week when I took his class). That said, sometimes he'll just forget to show up to his office hours, so it's good to send him an email if you're going to go. I do highly recommend going to his office though, as it can be a great help.

Homeworks are difficult, but are good at reinforcing what is done in lecture, and are only worth 5% of your grade, so they are much more for you as a tool to learn, and you'll essentially get out of them what you put into them. There are also occasionally a couple challenge questions that aren't graded, but can sometimes sneak their way into an exam. (More on that later, but he does release homework solutions before the exams).

Exams are difficult but fair for the most part. Our first exam he did pull out this question involving a random talyor series expansion that we never talked about, but in his defense the question was straight off the homework, it just caught everyone off guard because it was one of those challenge questions, and we never covered anything like it in class, so no one saw it coming and everyone got it wrong (But partial credit was clutch so it was aight). 

Speaking of partial credit, he is the most extraordinarily generous teacher with partial credit I've ever had in my life, up to and including preschool. In the taylor series problem I mentioned before, I literally just wrote the initial equation and left it there because I had no clue what to do and he gave me 15/20 on that question. He also gave me full credit for a question I didn't even get the right answer on because he spotted an algebra mistake I made and decided that I actually knew how to do the problem (LOL). 

He also has this great rule with exams that if your second midterm is better than your first, he'll REPLACE YOUR FIRST MIDTERM SCORE WITH YOUR SECOND. The dude is honestly a legend. He also has a rule that if you get an A on the final you get an A in the class, period. This is because in his mind, since the final is cumulative, if you ace the final, then that means you managed to understand what the class was designed to teach you by the end of the semester so therefore you should get an A (Sounds pretty reasonable to me).

Regardless of who you take, 205 is going to be a challenging course that requires some level of effort and enthusiasm to succeed in. That said, Gomez does a fantastic job of getting you excited about the topic, and as long as you put in the effort, you will learn a great deal from him. 10/10 would take again.",635
gomez_romel,3,B,ENEE205,"Gomez is a really good lecturer but is really unprepared for class , as he often goes overtime. His homework assignments are really difficult and take several hours to complete. This semester Gomez made the class difficult as compared to previous semester, exam averages were in the 60s, even with the amount of leniency he gives in grading. No curve beyond the one mentioned in the syllabus, as the expected class average at the end was around a B/B-.",635
gomez_romel,3,,ENEE205,"Dr. Gomez is an extremely friendly teacher that definitely seems to care about his students mastering the material. One thing to note is that he is giving students the opportunity to do extra work over winter break in order to raise their grades, which is very admirable.

However, I do not believe that Dr. Gomez has adjusted well to online learning. His lectures would likely be 10x more effective if taught in a classroom, but I cannot really blame him. His homework assignments are MUCH longer than stated on the syllabus, so be prepared to have a heavy weekly workload. Labs can often have confusing instructions but do not take too much time. The exams are mostly fair albeit having somewhat low averages. He does curve the exams sometimes, and has a generous curve at the end of the course.

I would recommend Dr. Gomez if you feel confident in your circuit abilities, but the class can be rough at times.",635
akin,5,,ENAE483,"I'm shocked and confused about the reviews below, enough to write my own which I never do. Dr. Akin is an extremely caring, intelligent, and passionate teacher. His 483 class is one of the best I've taken in my entire college career. No, he doesn't hold your hand. His deadlines are fluid and he's forgetful. However he treats his students with respect and is willing to show the same understanding towards your busy schedule as he expects that you, as his student, will show him. As long as you don't have a stick up your butt and are able to be somewhat flexible, you will thoroughly enjoy having Dr. Akin as a professor ",639
akin,1,A,ENAE483,"Akin is an awful professor. If it is not too late take the aero track and do not take any electives with Akin as the professor.

Here's the bottom line with Akin: He is so disorganized that he will never return any of your homework sets. He will return your midterm 1.5 weeks before the final, so you better hope you did well on the exam you took a month and a half ago. He will also give you homework with less than 5 days to do it. Then he will give an extension at 12:30 the night before it is due.

In 484 he will not be involved with your project. The only time he will give you feedback is at the reviews where he and his grad students will snicker at you because what you are proposing is ridiculous to them. He will not give you any grades throughout the semester so he may as well be randomly assigning grades at the end of the semester. He also does not seem to care that you need your grade to graduate or that the grades are actually due by a certain time. Overall, 484 is a class that should be the best class in college and Akin makes it the worst.

But let's dive into this. At one point we had a parts list all ready to go. We heard nothing from Akin, but ran into him by happenstance when trying to talk to another professor. We asked him about our parts list and he said that one of the grad students wanted to check it over in its entirety. So we went to that grad student who said Akin doesn't do shit and he didn't get the parts list. Then he and a different grad student fought about our parts list until they finally just let it go through. By the time our parts arrived we had 2 weeks to CDR and had to stop thinking about building and start putting slides together. Later on, after CDR I talked to Akin and he said that we should have ordered the parts earlier.

Like everyone else who has reviewed Akin, I had a miserable time in his class. The most shocking thing was grading in 484. I don't know how he did it. It was either he had two hats one with our names and one with grades and essentially made grading random or it was based on how much he likes you. He may also call you snotty while his grad students are trying to tear you apart.

AVOID AKIN. You will not like his class.",639
akin,1,,ENAE484,"What are my comments on this class? If I knew how this semester was going to turn out, I would have taken air track just to avoid this one class and my least favorite subject is aerodynamics. Akin keeps telling us 'this is what it'll be like in the real world' and because of that, has convinced me to avoid industry at all costs. I wholeheartedly and absolutely refuse to touch any space systems topic in the future because I never want to deal with anything or anyone like Dr. Akin ever again. 

The expectations and workload for this class were beyond what is reasonable for a 3 credit course which is supposed to have 9 hours a week of time outside of class. Oftentimes, we as a group spent over 9 hours in a day easily on this project, at times going to 12+ hours. This project would have been much better suited for a year long class. ENAE483, while interesting at times, was completely useless. Listening to a grab bag of topics that go no more in depth than what an hour or two of internet research can tell us does not help us at all for our design project. What we should have been doing was working on the Exospheres vehicle with Akin and the grad students the entire time. 

The first couple weeks of class, we were given a classroom and told to start designing. Since this was our 'design' time, Akin rarely was found during these class hours. Because of this, we all as a group were very confused on where to start as we were given no direction at all. Then after a week or two of this when he asks for our parts list. After seeing it, he basically goes on a rant, berating us since what we did 'was not engineering' and was 'a piece of shit' in his words.

If we were given more specific directions and a guideline of expectations instead of “I want a parts list for this robot in 2 weeks. I'll see you then.” we would have been able to fufill this. I understand that the technical topics that we researched were covered in previous classes, but we needed a bit more guidance from the theory to applying it. 

It doesnt help when the grad students and Dr Akin himself are both very condescending and short when you try to ask for help. That is, if you can find Dr. Akin in person long enough to ask him a question, because that is the ONLY way to get anything useful out of him. I've started to debate whether to title my subject line in emails to something along the lines of “RESULTS OF DARPA PROPOSAL” because I think he filters anything with ENAE484 to go to trash. 

Also, the grad students seem very annoyed to help us. Its painfully obvious that they see us as lowly undergrads incapable of understanding and checking numbers. In fact, at one point, it was a detriment as one grad student refused to put the 'OK' stamp to get parts ordered until he checked over every single part himself for a specific subgroup, something that was already double checked by avionics. In the end, it turns out there was no major problem, except for the fact that he delayed the order of parts. 

The Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR) and Critical Design Reviews (CDR) also seem useful in theory but bad in practice. The grad students that were so short to help us out before to answer any questions spend the 4 hours trying to find every single flaw in our design. At times, it felt like at least one of the grad students was intentionally trying to find flaws with the design. 

In the end, taking space track was my biggest regret of undergrad. I wish I could do it again but with Palumbo's capstone or design build fly. ENAE484 is a good idea in theory, but Dr. Akin implements it so horribly that I feel like he should be barred from ever teaching this course again. It's clear he spreads himself too thin and that the SSL has higher priority than 484 which is probably barely on his radar. 

Oh, and I marked N/A for 'Based on the quality of my work in this course, the grades I earned were “ because I have no idea how our grades are determined. I think he arbitrarily assigns people grades based on how much he likes us from the couple min of class he sees us in. 
",639
akin,1,A,ENAE484,"I don't really know where to start here. So I'll start with this: If this course were indicative of what my real-world aerospace engineering career was going to be like, I would quit. If it were indicative of a single job I would find a new job, where I would not be miserable, and if it were indicative of the entire industry I would find a different industry.

The project assigned is entirely unreasonable in scope. With under 20 of us, we were constantly scrambling in order to do what we hadn't necessarily been taught in the previous years. Many of the areas we needed to cover are taught as a graduate course devoted to a single topic, and not only had none of us taken that course, in many cases Dr. Akin was unable to help when asked questions on the topic.

It is true to say that he didn't himself understand the project he assigned us. He has in fact on multiple occasions answered questions with false information simply because that was the impression he had of what the physical reality was. It happened to be the wrong impression.

To some degree it is hard to say what Dr. Akin could and couldn't help with, because he tended to not respond to emails asking for help. He also tended to show up to class late, or, on multiple occasions, not at all. He split the class into two sections, which means that his attention (already not sufficient) was divided between the two groups.

Even had we had the support which we needed, this course would still have required too much work. At three credits it should be nine hours of work (counting in-class work) per week for fifteen weeks, or 135 hours over the semester. I -- along with many of my group members -- put in that amount of work in less than five weeks. And then we did it again. And then again. 

We worked as hard as we could for our first design presentation, and it was nowhere near good enough. This was due to two factors. 1) We didn't know what we were doing. ENAE483 had not prepared us for this experience, for researching things which our professor could not help with, for becoming experts on topics we'd never considered before in such a short time span. 2) There weren't enough of us to do the work. As I mentioned before, there were a lot of people who invested a lot of time in this course, frequently letting jobs, other classes, and personal commitments fall to the side. And it wasn't enough.

We got ripped apart during our presentation, and it wasn't at all in a constructive manner. It consisted of Dr. Akin and his graduate students mocking our attempts at analysis, asking questions to try to trip us up and laughing if they succeeded, and generally trying to prove that they were superior to us in knowledge. This was no surprise to me, they were graduate students and a professor who had had more time to learn these things.

There is a lot more I could say, but I'll keep it now to this: almost everyone I speak to in my group says they wish they had gone air track because and only because of this course, Dr. Akin shouldn't be permitted to teach undergraduates, and I really loathed this course. The last five months have been miserable because of it.",639
akin,1,B,ENAE484,The previous review hits it on the dot. He is the sole reason why you should avoid the space track. It really is that miserable. ,639
akin,1,C,ENAE484,"Dr. Akin is consistently unclear with his expectations. On top of being virtually entirely inaccessible, Dr. Akin is equally as unhelpful in guiding you through the design process. In ENAE483, he will not return your homeworks or midterm, so you will receive no feedback from him throughout the course. I have no idea how he grades that course. ENAE484 is a followup course to ENAE483, where you are expected to design a mission from scratch. Dr. Akin does not equip you with the tools or resources to be able to do this adequately, and then he will rip you apart during your presentations including making fun of you. He has been in the field for many years where he has learned to develop an incredibly large ego. He will constantly cite his own ""Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design."" Law 4 reads, ""Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment."" This is essentially his motto. He is rude and should not be allowed near students. Expect a negative experience.

If you have not chosen whether you are doing the aero or astro track yet, I would honestly recommend you choose aero just to avoid him, or transfer to a university with an adequate design professor.",639
akin,4,A,ENAE483,"Everything you hear about Dr. Akin being hard to get a hold of, forgetting to post assignments, etc. is true. That said, 483 is both one of the most interesting and useful courses in the aerospace major and he teaches it well. He recognizes his lack of organization and is generally happy to grant extensions and remove problems for assignments posted late if you ask. Despite the communication and scheduling issues, I have enjoyed the course and learned a great deal.",639
akin,1,A,ENAE484,"As much as I despise air track for not only their boring subject matter but for sort of making the degree a joke with how easy their classes are, if I had to do it all again I would 1000x over choose air track just so I could avoid having to take a class with Dr. Akin. I have never met a professor - scratch that, ANYONE - so deluded in their own ways that they believe hating literally everything you do in this class constitutes actual teaching and guidance.
Let’s say you have to design a thruster (because you can’t just use what already exists like the rest of the world). You think to yourself “hey, I remember learning something about this in the 483 slides, I’ll just use information from that, it came directly from Dr. Akin so it must be what he wants.” And so you go on with it, present your findings in the Design Review, and he says every bit of information you used is inaccurate and wrong and the analysis is faulty and you shouldn’t use info from his slides why would you even consider doing that. So, OK, no problem it was just PDR you’ll surely fix it by CDR, just take his information out, find new sources, redo all the work for that, good to go yeah? Wrong. Didn’t you know you covered the same concepts back in 483?? There were literally slides you could’ve pulled information from! Why would you not use the 483 slides when they were made accessible specifically for you to use in this class, it’s like you’ve just ignored a whole semester worth of teaching, how could you, how heinous, that deserves a 4/10 for technical content should’ve known better.
Don’t even get me started on how he doesn’t even look at the assignments he gives in 483 let alone grade them with any feedback, effectively wasting your entire semester that you could have used to plan for the RASC-AL competition, that he complains about how hard it is for UMD to gain entry into every year, instead of waiting until you only have a literal month to design an entire system. I honestly hope, for the future of the Space Track curriculum, he gets phased out with someone who can actually give constructive guidance. To anyone entering 484, I wish you the best.",639
akin,1,A,ENAE483,"Let me start off by saying, if I could give Dr. Akin a 0/5 I absolutely would with no question. He is the most disorganized, condescending, and apathetic professor I have ever had. In 483 you will learn absolutely nothing substantial, briefly cover a summary of all the previous classes you have taken up to that point, and you will work on lengthy and time-consuming projects with zero guidance that will never even be looked at, you’re basically getting a grade assigned to you at random. The midterm for 483 will be graded, if you’re lucky, by the last day of classes, then you have to turn around and take the final, both of which consist of a watered down version of previously taken content with poorly worded questions and honestly unclear methodology because his PowerPoint slides offer actually no guidance to how to do things like probability or MMOD analyses outside of a blurry graph with no context. I’m honestly not even sure why he bothers making 483 a class in and of itself, it serves no purpose, you won’t get anything out of it, and all it ends up doing is making it so that your capstone project for 484 lasts only a few months instead of an entire academic year. Oh and good luck with the whole “picking your group” he’ll prioritize his favorites who work in his lab and just give everyone else to a random group and random assignment (I wanted to be AFSS, I was instead put on MPA, likewise I wanted to do the Mars mission but again was put in a different group). Half of your team will not do anything for your team but will present results with no justification behind it in PDR and CDR and score significantly better than you because he won’t ask them any questions about their analysis despite being completely and glaringly incorrect. 

And on that note, he’s going to stand on his grand and prideful podium and give this haughty lecture about engineering presentation format - how to present, how to show data, etc - and then he will never follow his own advice. You can literally count all of the inconsistencies with how he says an ideal presentation should look and how he presents the lessons he is supposed to be teaching.

In 484, you are quite literally on your own. He will offer absolutely nothing and contribute absolutely nothing but will be the very first person to laugh at your analysis or progress when you try to ask him any questions. And you better believe he’s going to hate your PDR and CDR, in fact he hates them before you create them. He will call you rude for answering one of his “gotcha” questions (that are specifically designed to stump you up because he derives some sick pleasure in watching undergraduate students stumble and trip up) with something to the effect of “I hadn’t considered that and I will look into it for the next review.” And if he asks you something, you did an analysis that completely supports your assertion but he just doesn’t believe you, he will not look at your evidence, will not even humor the thought that he could actually be wrong, and will spend the next 5 minutes during your presentation talking to another panelist instead of paying attention to you, then complain that you didn’t present certain things when in reality you did he just ignored you. But that’s “what it’s like in the real world,” and he asserts he’s actually being quite generous. What a joke, if industry really was like that no one would ever work in Aerospace.

Why Akin is even allowed to teach anyone is beyond any level of understanding. You thought Winkelmann was bad, just wait.

483 and 484 are supposed to be what your degree leads up to - the ultimate experience of undergrad, completing a project you are supposed to be genuinely interested in. Dr. Akin has instead created a medium by which I was absolutely miserable the entire time taking his class. Everything felt like a chore, nothing I did interested me, and I had to spend countless long nights picking up the slack of my teammates who didn’t do a single thing to contribute. Don’t get me wrong, I love Aerospace I’m general, but for a “completely free design course” you are subject to the lunacy and frustrations that come with Dr. Akin’s power and superiority complex.",639

Overall, I would give ENES100's course difficulty a 4/5 with him, because although he grades fairly, if not a tad harshly, he expects you to know random information he said like once in lecture and he doesn't teach most of the content on these exams. ",643

tomblin,5,A,,"Good teacher, very helpful to students
class consisted of many weekly readings and 6 2-3 page response papers.
There was an essay exam given that was based on all the concepts of all the readings in class, so you need to keep up on your readings. 
and finally, there is the final project which you work on all semester long. there is a 10-12 paper, a poster presentation, and a power point presentation that make up the project.

overall, it was a good class",644

franklin_manoj,4,,ENEE303,"His lectures are clear, and his handwriting is amazing. Only reason I did not give him 5 stars is because he doesn't give out any homework assignments, so its hard to get any practice if you don't understand the examples he does in class.",646
franklin_manoj,4,A+,ENEE245,"To be honest, I didn't go to many lectures of 245, because I didn't think it was that necessary. The way that 245 is structured with Franklin, you can get away with just going over the slides and the prelab before your lab, because that's pretty much what Franklin does in lecture. 

That being said, the lectures that I did go to were pretty alright. I'm sure you've heard that he's got the most amazing handwriting in the department, which makes taking notes from him very nice.

If you're thinking of taking him for 245, I'd say go for it. His labs are relatively straight forward.",646
franklin_manoj,1,A,,"I rarely give professors 1 star reviews, but Franklin hit all the wrong places for me. He put in quite certainly no effort into the class and would always be late 5-15 minutes. The lecture wasn't too crucial, but it's at the very least extremely disrespectful to not be on time during allotted time. The class required almost nothing of him, and he wasn't even able to do the little it did. He NEVER responds to email and you need to track him down yourself. He seemed to have absolutely no regulation over the TAs and they all decided for themselves how they wanted to grade and how much extra credit to give, resulting in extreme discrepancies between classes. 

Very disrespectful and lazy man getting payed to ""lecture"" and do nothing. ",646
franklin_manoj,4,B+,ENEE303,"Franklin is an extremely organized lecturer, which is super ironic considering he doesn't bring notes to class and his canvas is as unorganized as I've ever seen. He speaks in a clear and concise manner, answers questions effectively, and doesn't go too fast. He appears to care about students, and is reasonable.

Unlike other reviewers have said, he never showed up to class late this semester, his accent is non-existent, and he is very organized. 

The nature of the course is very difficult, and to compensate he removed homework from the class. This is nice, obviously, because there's no homework, but quizzes and exams count for more, which is scary. Quizzes are graded extremely easily, and exams are harsh-- half of the points are multiple choice, and even if you select the correct answer you could get less than half credit if you don't explain yourself well enough.

It helps my note-taking that his handwriting is so neat, and I really appreciate that he doesn't vomit information onto the board, like so many math professors I've had. I think that overall Franklin is an excellent professor. He only got 4 stars from me because his canvas is unorganized and he doesn't respond to emails.",646
franklin_manoj,5,A+,ENEE303,"Excellent professor. Incredibly neat and organized on the board. Lectures are somewhat slow but are very easy to follow. As long as you don't mind starting lectures ten minutes late, you'll have a great time in this class.",646
franklin_manoj,5,A,ENEE245,Beautiful handwriting.,646
franklin_manoj,5,A+,ENEE303,"Dr. Franklin was a great professor for 303. What I like about him is that he explains everything in a clear and understandable way. This was one of the few classes where I was able to understand nearly everything he says in lecture, unlike other professors who fail to communicate those material clearly. He always shows up 10 minutes late and goes through material slowly, but I felt I learned a lot from his lectures. His teaching style just ""works.""

Exam questions appear to be variations of examples he did in class. The key to doing well on the dams is to understand the material intuitively by practicing a lot of problems. Averages tend to be in the high 60's, but it is possible to do  very well if you take advantage of test bank problems. He is pretty generous on partial credit though.",646
franklin_manoj,5,A,ENEE303,"Professor Franklin is an excellent professor for ENEE303.  He's been teaching the class for well over 10 years, so as a student, you quickly realize he's the best the university has to offer when learning about Transistors.  

By no means is this class an easy A.  You need to understand the material or else you will find yourself struggling come exam time.  I found the class to be rather easy to learn.  Make sure you understand Small-Signal Analysis for BJTs, MOSFETs, & Difference Amplifiers because they will be on the exam.  Understanding these concepts helped separate me from other students.  

The class is curved initially by 3%, but as the semester goes on, you'll notice the class is curved off of where you stand against your classmates.  He follows OURUMD grading distribution to the T, so use that to determine where you stand.",646
franklin_manoj,5,A,ENEE303,"Best professor ever !!! 
I recommend taking 303 with him and any other classes available with him cuz he goes by every detail and his exams are pretty much from the homework and class notes (you can do hwk if u have ur class notes) I got a B in this class but if i wudve put in an extra effort, I wud've definately gotten an A ",646
franklin_manoj,3,,ENEE245,"This was his first semester teaching 245, and it shows. Lectures would consist of him basically reading the lab specification to us. About halfway into the semester, the labs go from telling you exactly what to do to telling you no information at all. The last lab was copied off of the internet, but only the useless information. The final was okay, not representative of the semester at all, but the TAs graded fairly leniently.",646
franklin_manoj,5,A,ENEE303,"Thorough lectures, although it can be difficult to pay attention as he speaks very softly and mentions some important concepts in passing. He can be very meticulous in writing out diagrams, which makes note-copying (and catching up) much easier.

He did not give pop quizzes as in previous semesters, which was a bonus. His tests were relatively straightforward and he's pretty generous with partial credit.

My biggest complaint with the class was with the difficulty of the homework, which often stressed concepts we were not expected to know (and often did not cover) in lecture/exams. Still, overall, this was a pretty easy class, and Franklin was pretty great. As always, look at practice exams (helps immensely).",646
franklin_manoj,4,,ENEE303,"Franklin is pretty good. His lectures are extremely clear as he draws everything to quantum precision. He's pretty good at explaining stuff too. I actually wish he had given us more homework because I felt like we never really got to practice the problems enough. And I wish he wouldn't do his pop quizzes because they were pointless and tested memorization more than understanding of the concepts. But his tests are fair and they count for most of the grade, so it's pretty easy to get an A in the class.",646
franklin_manoj,4,A,ENEE303,"His lectures are awesome - if you are taking 303 with Newcomb you should try to sit in on Franklin's lectures if you can. His notes are very neat and clear.

His lectures can become somewhat disorganized, but it's just because he always asks students questions and tries to pick apart what they don't know. Whether you think this is good or not is up to you.

He also has pop quizzes in his lectures. They are multiple choice and count for a substantial portion of your grade. I think quiz were like 20%, HW like 10% and the rest was midterm + final.

His exams are extremely hard. Prepare well, do EVERY homework, and study like mad. Show *ALL* your work, even on multiple choice questions, as he gives lots of partial credit if your reasoning is good.",646
franklin_manoj,2,,,"He is boring, has a thick accent, can't teach, and is a total jesus freak. The enee206 lectures are pointless to go to. You don't learn anything at all. He posts the powerpoints online so just review them at your dorm before you go to class. He is nice though. ",646
franklin_manoj,5,A,ENEE303,"AWESOME professor! 
For all EE students: u'll be better off taking this prof for whatever class he teaches. He has an awesome curve. 
First of, you have to pay attention in class for the multiple choice lecture quizzes. And you have to note that these are almost the same questions on the exams. Also, you have to go over and solve the practice exam questions since the exam questions are similar to those. 
Also he is a little difficult to catch for office hours. So in case you need help you have to talk to him after class. Because he takes some time before replying to emails. ",646
franklin_manoj,5,,ENEE303,"I took professor Franklin for both ENEE303 and ENEE313 and can honestly say that he has been one of the best professors I've ever had.  What I like most about him is that he explains things in a very clear and understandable way.  Also he is a really fair grader, and the problems you get on the test are usually the same or very similar problems to what was in the homework or in examples from the book.",646

franklin_manoj,2,A-,ENEE245,"It's a shame that this class is so poorly taught and managed, because it could be a really important, fundamental class for computer engineers. The lectures are just a review of some basic ENEE244 concepts, which is a complete waste of time. It is basically assumed that you come into the class with a foundation in Verilog, a very difficult language to pick up but a crucial one to learn for anyone interested in FPGAs. If lecture was changed to just teach Verilog and the lecture were actually informative and helpful (Franklin was not a good lecturer. He was vague and hard to understand), the class might have been one of my favorites.",646
franklin_manoj,2,A,ENEE244,"This is one of those courses that is so needlessly made challenging and stressful by how inept the teacher is at organizing it. Manoj Franklin does not directly teach material from the textbook, most of his notes are oral (and he has a thick accent), and there is no syllabus that describes what to learn. So, there is a lot of stressful guesswork that goes into learning the curriculum. It would be completely unlearnable if not for the hardworking TF's that have learned from the previous semester what Manoj intends for us to learn.",646
franklin_manoj,3,,ENEE244,"Hopefully my reign with this professor is over. I've taken ENEE324, ENEE244 and ENEE245 with him, and each class varied a lot in terms of how difficult he made it. 324 was a nightmare because it was all math and he really did not try to make the material interesting through lecture. Exams were extremely unpredictable in terms of what he could test us on; he referenced the textbook several times however the problems from the book ended up being different in terms of content compared to what was on the exam. This class will be difficult no matter who you take it with, and he will not make it any easier. However, I had a good experience with him for 244; he tried to relate the material to real world concepts as much as possible and made fair exams that covered everything he talked about in class. 245 was another nightmare though, where Verilog was barely taught in class but  tested rigorously through the prelabs which is a shame because it is a very interesting class. What's even more crazy is that you are expected to know the language and associated concepts thoroughly for the exams... this was evident especially through the final exam. Overall Franklin will always be a mixed bag in terms of his exams as it is difficult to prepare for them. Expect to work super hard if you are enrolled in any of his classes.",646
franklin_manoj,2,B+,ENEE245,"Dr. Franklin is just a really uncaring and messy professor. He cancelled lectures without notifying any of the students, he posted one practice exam from 2012 (which isn't helpful at all for the exam), and he's not good at using technology at all. Your grade in the class is also completely dependent on the TA you have. ",646
paley,4,A,ENAE301,"Paley is a pretty smart man, and I think he enjoys showing that off in class. While he explains the concepts well, he is not great at showing their application. The book is semi-helpful but most examples are either way too simple or way too involved. homework questions can be vague and seem unrelated to the concepts of the chapter or even to dynamics in general.

However, Paley really does try hard to make Dynamics understandable and doable. He is helpful to a fault in office hours, often taking 30 minutes to explain a simple error and leaving other students unanswered. Still, its undeniable that he is a pretty good teacher and probably one of the best Dynamics teachers at the University. 

Use office hours and really understand each chapters main concepts and you will be fine.

reminds me of Dennis Reynolds from IASIP",648
paley,4,C+,ENAE301,"Dr. Paley is a good professor. He is enthusiastic and very patient. This class is hard though. The other review discounts the homework... Don't. Do it and understand it. We also did not get practice exams so we went into the midterm and final blind. And they were much, much more difficult than anything we saw in class or on homeworks. Class was curved about 10% because the grades on the final were so terrible. ",648
paley,4,A,ENAE301,"The other post is pretty accurate about this class. The lectures are clear and helpful; however, the homeworks are very difficult and time consuming. I strongly encourage anyone taking this class to do the homeworks in groups since many of the problems are pretty difficult. The exams are easier so you don't really need to study for them if you work hard on the homeworks. I worked very hard in this class so I was really happy when an A showed up on my transcript!",648
paley,4,A,ENAE301,His lectures are easy to follow but unfortunately they don't prepare you to do the homework well.  The problems are vague and consume a lot of time.  Luckily each problem set ends up being only about 3% of your grade so if you screw up on a few of them it's OK.  Tests were straightforward and included only the most basic concepts.  He gives out last year's tests for practice and if you can do the problems there then you're good.  He curves a lot so it's not hard to do well.  Don't waste too much time doing the homework.,648
paley,4,C+,ENAE301,"Dr. Paley is a pretty good professor. His lectures and demos are interesting, but they do not prepare you for the homework very well.  However, he is very willing to discuss HW problems in his office hours and does a much better job at explaining concepts there. They were also held right before class, which was very helpful. Seriously, go to office hours. I learned that way too late. 
Paley also will give nearly infinite extensions on HW. The first week is no questions asked, but after that you need a valid excuse. 
The midterm exam was okay. It was pretty fair, but was not like the problems done on class or on the homework. The average was around 75%. The final was similar to the midterm, but was more difficult due to the content in later chapters. The average on the final wasn't great (60%), so the class was curved about 7-9%.
Overall, Paley is really understanding and tries to make an extremely difficult class doable. ",648
paley,5,A-,ENAE301,"Dr. Paley is a cool professor. He uses lots of examples, videos, and in class demonstrations to show concepts. The weekly homework can be difficult, but as many people have said it helps a lot to go to office hours. Dr. Paley makes an effort to learn everyone's name in office hours even though a ton of kids go. He does expect you to participate and work along with the examples in class. However, he is very easy to talk to and will go to great lengths to help you understand a problem/concept. 

This class is still pretty difficult and stressful but Paley makes the best possible effort to make everyone in the class understand. I'm far from one of the smartest kids in aerospace but I've done pretty well in this class thanks to his help. Also, shoutout to our T.A. Austin for his help.",648
goulias,3,B+,ENCE300,"Goulias:
Unclear: He has a strong accent that is sometimes hard to decipher. He had very small handwriting not easily visible from even halfway back in the classroom.
Boring: The 2 hour lecture associated with this class killed me. It was very dry, even Goulias seemed bored by the material.
Unreasonable: My group submitted our lab report in PDF format instead of a word document. Since we also submitted it hard copy, and that was where all the comments were made, we figured it would be ok. Little did we know that this was an offence that went ""beyond understanding, excuses and reasons"" so our group must ""suffer the consequences.""
Bizarre: We had to take the exams in pen. Still haven't figured out why. Everyone's paper was a mess of scribbles and crossings out. Math should be done in pencil. For each exam, you get a letter grade, A, B, C, or D. Once I got a C by getting one problem completely right and the other completely wrong. I got a B for the same breakdown on the next exam.
Unfair: He said our lab report grades were too high. The class average was a 95%. So he downcurved everyone, but only told us that on the very last day of classes.

The Class:
50% of the class is Goulias lecturing, the other 50% is lab. Lab is so much fun, and super easy. My TA was wonderful, clear, fun, and engaging. One lecture she taught the class and we all learned so much more than when Goulias teaches. In lab, you weight things, watch things break, and mix things. Mostly you chill with the rest of the students in your lab section waiting for it to be your turn. Only one lab took the whole time, almost always we got out an hour early.
",650
goulias,1,C-,ENCE300,"I did not end up with the grade I expected. The teacher was very vague about his grading scale.  He told us that if you got below a certain amount you got a C on the first exam, once finals came around the then said that your exam grade is not curved.  Which was contradictory from what he said on the midterm.

I got an A in lab, but somehow barely scraped by in this class.

He's extremely boring to listen to and it's not informative. Everything he goes over is literally in the book.  The lab TAs were much more helpful than the professor.",650
goulias,1,,ENCE300,"The lectures are sooo boring. 2 hours of him flipping through powerpoint too fast to take any notes. For whatever reason this semester he decided to not give any homework and just give quizzes every week. 50% of the class gets a 0, its ridiculous. Plus he sweats profusely and adds all his female students on facebook, so inappropriate. So glad he isn't my advisor.",650
goulias,3,B+,ENCE300,"This class is boring as hell. Every lecture it was two hours of powerpoints. It was beyond horrible. Labs are okay. The TAs are nice.

goulias,3,A,ENCE300,"This is for ENCE300- Kim section (I couldn't review for him specifically).

Its a really boring lecture, but just pay attention to the things that he says to pay attention to. 

Put some effort into talking to him outside of class, and do the homework to get extra credit.

It can be tricky, but its not the hardest class ever.

For the rest, you can e-mail him and he'll get back to you promptly.  You still have to go to class because he takes attendance but you don't have to pay attention (no one does).  

Make sure you study for the quizzes by reading the lecture notes and start your project early.  Our group started the weekend before it was due and I had to put in over 15 hours of work on it alone.  He says he doesn't curve but I ended up with a 82% but I still got an A.  ",652

Almost everything was graded on completion, and extra credit was given out inconsistently (though this was due to the TAs).

The exams were pretty awful, with both the midterm and final averages being about 50, even with extra credit questions. The class was graded so that even if you scored 33 on the exams you would still pass. 

Take Smela if you don't want to fail, but I can't recommend her if you want to really learn the material.",656
smela,5,B,ENME351,"I think maybe Smela has changed her style since these previous reviews were posted... they don't even sound like they're describing the same person.

I found her teaching to be very informative, thorough, and clear. Homeworks are graded on completion - If you turn something in, you get 100/100. I've even turned in stuff that's only like 1/3 complete and still gotten 100. Labs are basically graded on completion as well. If you show up and get it to work, you get a 100.

The midterm was graded pretty harshly - I think 50% was the average - but I believe she plans to curve the final grade if necessary.

I would recommend Smela very highly!",656
smela,1,,ENME351,"Avoid taking ENME351 with smela at all costs. You will thank me later. The only good part about her class is she speaks fluent english, so at very least you can understand the words she is saying.

She should stick to her research and never teach again.",656
smela,1,C,ENME351,"Smela is a very smart professor, but she does not know how to teach.  She does not convey the concepts of the class and expects that everyone knows how to do the problems prior to her teaching us the concepts. Furthermore, she is a control freak.  Every week she has a seating chart made for the class, which you must follow.  She even has a seating chart for her exams.  Her quizzes are not that bad, but the Labs are a waste of time.  Her grading rubric tells you how to get an 85...yes an 85/100 is what her grading rubric tells you how to get.  So save yourself and don't take this professor for ENME351.",656

She is extremely smart, however I'm amazed every day as she will talk for 50min and not really say anything. Half of the class is spent learning how to draw graphs. The other half is a collection of random topics, topped off in the last two weeks with non-stop talk about her research. 

As I'm sitting here studying for the final, I really don't know what the whole class was suppose to teach me. 

Some other random comments:
* There is one test during the semester. She had the entire class retake it because we didn't do well enough.
*Yes, 60% of the class did drop, after taking the test twice.
*Lab rubrics tell you how to get an 85/100, its up to you to go above and beyond to get that 100.
*The labs are bullshit
*Quizzes were given everyday at the beginning of class, that changed towards the end to once a week.
*Office hours are not helpful
*The seating chart was ridiculous, luckily after half of the class left, she gave up.
*Homework is done by scouring Wikipedia and the rest of the internets, can take anywhere from 30min (when shes nice, that one time) to about 3 hours.

abed,4,,ENEE324,"Helpful professor who will do all he can to help you learn and succeed. Once me and another student met him in the hallway before an exam. We asked if he could give extra help but he was on the way to have a late lunch. So he invited us to join him, drove us to a restaurant, paid for our lunch, and helped us with problems and continued in his office after we got back. He is a good teacher and cares about his students.

Highly recommended for undergrad courses in systems and probability (322, 324, 460,...)",662
abed,5,C,ENEE322,"Dr. Abed knows ENEE322 inside out and lectures clearly. He made himself available to students, putting as much time as needed to help outside class. He made the difficult material of ENEE322 interesting and connected it with the real world. He prepared detailed typed solutions to all assignments and exams. I enjoyed taking his class and I still go see him for advice.

A negative was using slides more than the board but this helped him cover a lot of material. All the slides were available to the class (sometimes they were from MIT open courseware and once or twice from the book).

Take ENEE322 with this professor if you can.",662
abed,3,A+,ENEE322,"Dr. Abed is quite disappointing actually. He was a funny guy and made the occasional joke. It was obvious he cared about being liked. However, he always came to class unprepared and would literally read off the book. When he didn't read off the book, he would just read off slides from MIT. The way to summarize his attitude towards the class is: He wanted to be cool and liked, but he didn't want to put any effort in order to achieve it. 

He would give homework in a disorganized manner and at one point gave an extremely long assignment because he was too lazy to make one for weeks. He would regularly let class out early due to lack of preparation. I was truly disappointed with the low amount of effort Dr. Abed put into the course.

That being said, he made exams towards the easy side of things. People still did pretty terribly with averages in 65-70 range, and he curved generously at the end. You'll learn an average amount of material taking ENEE322 with him, but the time won't be utilized in an efficient manner.",662
abed,5,A-,ENEE322,"Highly recommended.  This guy is amazing!  He's hilarious, and teaches quite well.  Tons of problems, and makes sure you are prepared for the exam.  For some reason, averages were low on all exams, but he's a great professor.  He also talks a lot about people from his days at MIT, which tend to be interesting, and also cracks jokes at some impossible system configurations.  If you are a nerd like me, you appreciate the humour.

Take this guy for whatever he teaches.  I'm taking him for 460 next semester.",662
abed,5,A,,"Incredible professor. He is actually incredibly funny, made fun of the other professors teaching the course etc. He also does a lot of problems, and makes sure you're ready for his tests. Constantly encourages people to do better, and was pretty lenient with exams (allowed us to drop our lowest).

One drawback was that he wasn't as approachable as some would have liked, I personally had no problems but friends didn't get to meet with him with problems very often.",662
abed,3,A+,ENEE222,"He's a very kind person, but he doesn't explain so well in lecture. He also doesn't do so many examples so it's not clear how to do the homework. Midterm and final grades were very low so there was a massive curve.",662
abed,4,A,ENEE460,"Not the best lectures, but he is a very helpful and kind professor that does everything in his power to help the students succeed. Massive curve of 10% as well, even though it technically was not needed (class average was around a ~79). ",662
abed,5,,ENEE463,"A very kind professor who does want others to succeed. He does teach directly off of the textbook and slides, but he does make an effort to explain things. So as long as you read the textbook he gives you, you will do fine on his exams. Though this teaching style is not the best, he is very reasonable, understanding,  and there is a curve in the class. I took him for 222 and took him again for 463. ",662
sriram,1,A-,BIOE120,"I am posting this review to potentially sway you to NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. As a straight A student at UMD, and a very-hard worker, I found the content and manner in which Sriram teaches class to be ineffective at evaluating my knowledge of basic biology-engineering concepts. The content of the tests and homeworks are completely irrelevant to the Engineering curriculum of your major, and test you on material that is most often not taught in class. Expect to be taken back by the arrogant attitude of the professor as well as his hasty emails that lack any sort of professionalism. Also, expect to spend the majority of your time at Keystone, with the TA. Having Dr. Sriram teaching Biology for Engineers, is a disgrace to the University as well as the Engineering School. Does not care about the students. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",665
sriram,2,,BIOE120,"Professor Sriram is very intelligent and knows what he's talking about... That being said... He is not a good teacher... I very much dislike him and his attitude.  He acts like biology is the end all be all of the world and that everyone loves it as much as him and knows as much as him.  He makes the homeworks and the exams near impossible.  Also, I had to miss a couple of his classes (and one exam) for medical reasons, and he was completely uncooperative! It took me an entire month A MONTH to finally get ahold of him and get him to give me the make up exam... I wound up taking it two days before the second exam causing me to have little time to study for the second exam (I wound up failing the 2nd exam). He has a very high opinion of himself.  Sriram is lazy and never gets anything graded and returned to you in a reasonable manner nor does he ever get anything to you on time.  Yet he penalizes us very heavily for being even a minute late on our homeworks. Overall, I am not a fan...",665
sriram,3,A-,,"He's okay. As totally typical of Sriram, his homeworks are hard and will take you a long time. However, this class is easy, and there were only 5 hws total, and 1 of them was really easy. Our class had all sorts of majors in the class, so I feel like it had to be that way. You have to be comfortable with basic matlab scripts for this class. He also lets you bring anything to the exam.  You don't need any textbooks for this class. ",665
sriram,5,A,BIOE120,"Sriram might pull some ridiculousness when it comes to turning in homework in time (He arrives late half the time too) but he also knows what hes talking about. he overplays his own research, but he knows how to explain what he wants to, and the same things he stresses in class he will stress on a test. if you go to class every day and pay attention you should have no problem acing any class he teaches, he's the kind of genius being a doctor at the age of 26 suggests",665
sriram,2,,BIOE120,"Dr. Sriram is TERRIBLE. like others have said he's brillant, and he really is; but he expects you to know as much as he does while taking this intro course. His homeworks are ridiculously hard and his grading on his homeworks are pretty unfair. Its HW #3 and I've spent hours upon hours in research for things the average bio person doesn't know. this is an intro class but he treats it like a 300-400 level class. I don't know what the exams are like but I'm sure it wont be pretty. whatever you do DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! if you have to wait a semester for another one I'd strongly advise it.",665
sriram,4,A,BIOE120,"Sriram is extremely smart, and sometimes I think he expected his students to think the same way he does. You have to go to class, as he memorizes all 100+ students in the lecture by name and will notice if you aren't there. He expects quiet at all times and the class can get extremely boring, but he is kind at heart and will occasionally try to crack a joke.

The class itself was difficult in that the weekly homework he assigned always seemed to take a couple hours and would be more difficult than anything covered in class. His tests also were very tough. 

This being said, he was an easy grader. On tests, the range for an A was usually anything over a 70. I ended up with an 85 in the class (without any curves) and was comfortably in the A range. He is also very receptive to students during office hours.",665
sriram,4,A-,BIOE120,Dr. Sriram is tough. Not gonna lie. But hes absolutely brilliant and really knows his stuff. From wht ive heard the other professors for BIOE120 are also really hard so I'd say Sriram is as good a bet as any but be prepared to work hard. Theres a good curve though so if u stay above the average you should be just fine.,665
sriram,2,,BIOE120,"Dr. Sriram is the DEVIL.
He knows what he's teaching inside and out. He's an extremely intelligent person and a good lecturer, albeit a little monotone and too fast-paced. Unfortunately, his homeworks are super hard and take me HOURS to do, and his exams are just ridiculous. Even if you understand the material, it's a very comprehensive class. He tries to get you to apply concepts in ways that are difficult to see at first. He also teaches stuff that you apparently learn in upper level courses, making it unnecessarily difficult... I think his manner of teaching this class is really unfair for an introductory level class. I got a 5 on AP bio and an A in bsci207, and I still found his class very difficult. 
He's not very approachable and makes you feel rather stupid when you ask questions. His exam averages are really low (like 60%). Not entirely sure how big his curves are, but as of now, I have a B-. He likes to curve the class so that most students will get a B, but his class is honestly not worth the time. If you have the option of taking another teacher DO IT. It'll save you hours of time, and your ego from taking a beating. ",665
sriram,4,B,BIOE120,"Dr. Sriram really knows his stuff!
He teaches using the chalkboard, and gives examples and stuff, but when you start the hw, it's like 10 times harder then what he went over in class. Also, he says that he'll have something done by a certian day (like assigning the new hw, or updating grades), but it never is. You'll come to expect that saying he'll return something on monday really means thursday, or friday at the earliest.
He does take advantage of the discussion feature on bb though, and it is extremely helpful!!!! I wish all of my teachers used this feature.
Basically, take a crapload of notes and ask questions, and you'll be fine.",665
sriram,4,B+,,"Good professor, knows his chemE.  Tough course with tough exams and tough homework.  Put a lot of time into reviewing notes/book/homework and go to his office hours, and you should do well. ~70% cutoff for an A",665
sriram,3,A+,,"The first equation Dr. Sriram wrote on the board was ""THERMO=HARD"", and it turns out it is a hard class. That being said Dr. Sriram was able to clearly explain most of the concepts and was always available during office hours. His exams were extremely difficult and he ended up curving to make a 70 an A. Some of his homeworks are ridiculously hard, but if you show him that you have attempted the problem, he will give you some hints. 
P.S. NEVER go late to his class and NEVER interrupt his lectures, or you will be on his shitlist. ",665
sriram,3,B,,"I wouldn't say Dr. Sriram is the best professor, but he definitely tries to get the material across in an understandable fashion. Obviously in a chemical engineering course, if you don't keep on top of your work, you'll fall behind, and have to work your ass off to catch back up, so I don't understand why people are complaining about his course, especially since he makes himself readily available via email and office hours. 

If you have Sriram as your professor, it's important to go to lectures and write everything down. Yes, I mean everything. You never know what might help you on the homeworks or tests (tests are open note, open book). 
",665
sriram,3,B,,"As the first class in chemical engineering, it is hard to know what to expect in ENCH215.  However, if you have Professor Sriram, expect a fairly difficult class.  Sriram himself wasn't a bad lecturer and was able to explain the concepts clearly enough (for me at least).  Unfortunately, he seems really distant and condescending in lecture, but he is a pretty nice guy outside of class.  However, that is about all the good I can say for the class as a whole.  As far as I know, Sriram only has one graduate student under him and therefore only one TA.  This TA is horrible.  It is difficult to understand him and he does not teach well so going to discussion is pointless.  Homework was just enough of your total grade to mess it up if you did not do well on the homework.  Homework was weekly and it was impossible.  No matter how much I worked on the homework during the week, I would still end up staying up all night the night before homework was due.  Because of Sriram, I have seen more sunrises than I care to count.  No matter how well you think you know the material from the lecture, the homework will still make you desperately search through the book for a way to solve the problems.  Quizzes were annoying, but they were pretty easy especially if you brought your book (open book).  However, they did not reflect the tests.  Even though tests were open note/open book they were still pretty difficult.  The sample exam was approximately the same difficulty as the actual test, but the actual test was changed just enough that you felt like the sample test did not help at all.  The only redeeming quality in all of this is that Sriram's curve is pretty generous, with a majority of the class getting B's.  If you're looking to get an A then good luck, but if you're okay with a B then with some effort it is not too difficult because of the curve.
",665
sriram,2,A,,"Sriram relies far too much on PowerPoints for a class that centers on problem solving and analysis.  The basic material was presented clearly, but the strategies and tools needed to actually solve the problems on an exam were difficult to learn from his Powerpoints.  I found him to be quite approachable and likable during office hours/appointments, but he comes off as very arrogant and condescending towards his students during lecture.  At some points during the semester, he would single out certain students in class as some kind of attempt to set an example.  
Sriram is also very nitpicky.  Homework (which was often excessive and difficult) needed to be completed on engineering paper, stapled, signed with the honor code, and folded LENGTHWISE.  If this was not done correctly, your homework would not be graded and you will receive a zero.
Exams were okay for the most part, but a huge curve was always needed for half the class to pass.  The overall grades for the class were fair (majority A's and B's), but most of us felt like we were going to fail for about 90% of the semester.    ",665
sriram,1,,,"I wish you could score less than a 1. This guy is totally pointless and the TA is even worse. He uses powerpoint which when you take a class on concepts and theories don't help. He expects you to be able to get this new information from day 1 with no problems whatsoever. He's wrong. The book is pointless too (tip: don't bother finding the solutions manual since it has a lot of errors and he'll trap you if you use it for help). I'm pretty sure I'll be changing my major now thanks to him. Some people liked him, but a man that uses a ""factor of 5"" on how long it's projected you'll finish a test is a total failure of a teacher especially for an introductory level course. He makes himself available to the students, but he'll make you feel like a moron too. No redeeming qualities at all.",665
sriram,3,A,,"As a lecturer, he's relatively clear and gets the concepts across well.  However, I feel as though he is entirely out of touch with what its like to be a student.  HW sets take several hours and are graded so harshly that getting even a B (80/100) on them is near impossible.  Also, the HW problems are far harder than the exams.  I feel like the HW sets are generally useless and did not help me understand the material.

He's not very understanding... counts HW sets late if you don't arrive at class precisely on the hour.  He expects everyone to ask regular questions, but then mocks students for not understanding some material.  Generally not approachable.  I think he enjoys the fact that small mistakes can really mess up your grade.  For instance, failing to bring the book to lecture could result in you failing the pop quizzes.",665
sriram,1,,,"He's a fuck face.  He can't teach for crap and assumes the class knows everything.  I know you probably don't have a choice if you take him or not, but good luck (you'll need it)",665
sriram,5,A,BIOE120,"He had a good lecture style, printed packets for you, and had interesting lectures. If you ever needed help for anything in his class, he was more than willing to take time and go through it with you. He would also post multiple hints or clarifications on ELMS promptly whenever you emailed him a question. Though I found his discussions kind of pointless (but mandatory) he was a nice guy who genuinely loves teaching his students and the materials. ",665

sriram,1,B,CHBE444,"Sriram is of another dimension. If you are not capable of committing 20+ hours a week to complete all the work he has set out for the class then you will suffer and there is nothing you can do about it. He tries very hard to organize the course in a unique method but it only serves to make finding anything pertinent annoying. Rather than find a more effective method to engage the class to ensure understanding every assignment is made unnecessarily complicated so  you have to spend hours on end working through each assignment. Lectures cover the simplest of examples while assignments more based in reality are impossible as the class material is practically irrelevant. After many complaints about the strenuousness of the course, rather than reduce the complexity of everything, Dr. Sriram instead overhauled the course entirely so that the only consistent portions of the course were now gone and we had to adjust to an entire new structure half way through the semester. All of this is to say that while his heart is in the right place in trying to be a good teacher, every effort misses its target by a country mile and instead the class is simply punished week after week.

qu,3,,ENEE244,"He's an ok lecturer, but it is sometimes hard to understand what he is saying. As for the courseload, the homework was reasonable. He did make the 3rd exam and final very hard, so I would recommend trying harder once you get to the last 3rd of the course. ",666
qu,5,A,ENEE140,"Great professor! I feel like he really wants you to work hard and have a deep understanding of the material. He focuses on you learning how to problem solve. 140 was an easy class but the project can be very time consuming. 

He also taught 150 and the difficulty level was definitely increased tenfold. Very long projects and most exams were pretty difficult. You could tell by the end of the semester some students were pretty stressed out, but that is expected. He basically tells you the main things that will be on the exams but to expect pretty much everything he has gone over. You really need to manage your time wisely. Most questions on the exams were ones that I had not yet tried to implement so you need to be on your toes and prepared to think and problem solve! 

Overall, if you put in the time and effort you should do well and also learn some too!",666
qu,4,A+,ENEE140,"Pretty average professor, nothing extraordinary or terribly bad about his teaching style. There is an accent here, but I think it's pretty understandable. Pay attention, maybe he'll tell you the story of how he told his son he couldn't play basketball.

For 140, he had our class get a little paper booklet of the all the notes for the entire class at the beginning of the semester for like $5. If you've had any programming experience before this class, 140 will probably be pretty easy. If not, consult that booklet all the time. Seriously, it has pretty much everything need in it.

For 244, I thought he was a pretty good teacher. Better than Silio at actually teaching, and I'm assuming better than Nakajima just based on the horror stories I've heard about his 244 class. When I took it, he fit 3 exams into the semester as well as a final exam, but I don't think he usually does that. Our final and our third exam had a lot of overlap, because not many people did well on that third exam. The end of his exams always have extra credit questions, but they're pretty tough so don't bank on these for points.


Qu grades on a curve..kind of. He doesn't like when you have hard cut offs and someone is like 0.01 away from a letter grade, so he clusters grades near enough to eachother to be certain letter gradse, and decides the cutoff when there is a big gap in grades. For example, 93, 92.5, 94 might all be A's, but if the next grade is 88 that could be a B. ",666
qu,4,,ENEE140,"He seems like a nice guy, but the class is very hard if you have never done any programming before. The projects take a ton of time and effort so make sure you start them early. This class was way too much work for a 2 credit class but I don't necessarily blame that on Dr. Qu.",666
qu,4,A,ENEE140,"Tough class, but he is an average teacher. The class is dependant on the TA you have, so if you don't feel like you have a good one, try to change it ASAP. His lecture notes are good, but I would have liked to get more out of discussion. ",666

qu,4,B,ENEE150,"Qu was just an ok lecturer. I didn't feel like I picked up a lot during class, but programming is generally a self-taught class so it wasn't a big deal. Reasonable grading scales and doable exams/projects. I wasn't great at the class but programming isn't my bag. ",666
qu,2,A+,ENEE140,"This is a really poorly structured and disorganized course. His lectures were extremely basic and off sync from the labs by two or so weeks for most of the semester. By the time we finished the first project, Qu had just started covering the required material in lecture. The lab manual is also sometimes obtusely worded, so be wary of that. This class is highly TA dependent, so be sure to attend office hours often and ask questions frequently. Do your projects early. I learned almost all of the material in the class by reading a textbook (Stephen Prata's C Primer Plus) and attending office hours. This course did not feel like 2 credits of work, especially for what was intended to be an introduction to programming. Having experience with C or another programming language would have been incredibly helpful.",666
qu,3,A,ENEE150,"Lectures were fine. Tests weren't as hard as expected. However, especially during the transition to online format, we were left in completely the dark about our grades and how the course would be adapted. ",666
qu,3,B,ENEE140,"Dr. Qu was just ok at lecturing and instructing this course. He's decently helpful in office hours and very nice once you get him talking, but his lectures can be pretty dry. I took this class with no prior programming experience at all and found it challenging, but not impossible. The homework was pretty fair, and the projects were sometimes tough so I basically lived in office hours. The TAs we had during my semester in this class were phenomenal, so sometimes they really do make or break the course. This class should be more than 2 credits given the work load, but I don't blame Qu for that (the EE department kind of sucks in general...) ",666
qu,3,A,ENEE244,"So, I did learn a bit, and I think the class was fair. What makes it difficult to recommend Dr. Qu is that he is extremely disorganized. I never felt as stressed for exams as I felt about last-minute assignments and such. Often, he would say ""homework is coming out tomorrow"", then it comes out a week later, he extends the deadline, then quizzes us on the homework the day before it's due, and so on. If you can handle the stress of a disorganized course, I think it would be good to take Qu because he is not too bad otherwise. He's a mediocre lecturer, but the homework is very similar to the exams, and he is forgiving when he makes organizational mistakes.",666
pertmer,5,A,ENES102H,"Great professor, as all of the other reviews said so I will not elaborate.

Teaches by example, which is great. Will always answer questions and is very approachable.

No curve (well, he normalizes the grades so the highest grade becomes the new 100, but grading is pretty easy so the highest grade is probably 98+). No +/-, but that's true for all 102 sections, at least when I took the class.

Take Pertmer, he's great!",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102,"Prof. Pertmer is definitely the professor for ENES102. 

He is approachable, personable, and never gives the impression that he takes himself too seriously. He will make jokes during lecture (some of them are subtle but still quite funny). 

The material itself is not that hard, and Prof. Pertmer never makes it harder than it has to be. Lectures can sometimes be a bit dry (I had the 2 pm lecture and every now and then I would zone out a bit), but they are not too long (50 min vs. 75 min) so this is usually not a serious issue. 

The HWK is through Mastering Engineering and generally is free of errors (which can be a serious annoyance on online HWK). It varies from being relatively simple in the beginning to somewhat time-intensive (though not impossible). I would give it a range from 1-4 hr per week. 

I went to his office hours once to check my HWK because I had to miss a class, and he was very helpful and willing to answer all manner of questions.

There are two tests and a final; Prof. Pertmer posts a ton of review questions for every topic, and those questions alone are usually plenty for the exams. The two tests he made for us during the semester were not bad and he allows an equations sheet. The final exam (joint for every ENES102 professor and section) was tougher, but still fair. 

There are no +/- grades, and generally speaking getting an A is not too hard if you've had some physics in HS and do not mind some math. It's not a free A, but Pertmer removes most of the roadblocks. 

If you need to take 102 and he is an option, take his class. ",667
pertmer,5,B,ENES102,"Dr. Pertmer is incredibly approachable, thorough, and funny. He teaches by example, which makes it very easy to learn. He goes at a good pace, and explains well. I never used the textbook. The weekly Mastering Engineering homework isn't fun, but really helps you learn the material. It took me 2-4 hours. The class is not really curved, and he does not give +/-, so I really earned a B+ but got a B.",667
pertmer,5,B+,ENES102H,"Great professor! Good at explaining concepts, and has a good balance in class between equations and example problems. Good review sessions in discussion every Friday. We did in-class problems in groups of three. 

Exams were fair, and the practice problems he posted were extremely helpful when studying.

Homework was handled very well. We had five problems online for practice and the sixth one was graded online, but the five practice problems had to be written out and handed in during class for credit. This allowed instantaneous checking of answers, but then forced us to write out the whole process, which ultimately helped me on the test.

The only reason I am not expecting an A is because I took the class at 9 AM and I failed to turn in some assignments because I woke up late.",667
pertmer,4,,ENES102H,"Pertmer is nice and incredibly understanding. I've had a few issues I had to address to him, like taking up a make-up exam, and he was always very approachable and easy to talk to.

As a teacher, he's competent, covers all the material you need (I know a couple of other teachers miss some things that Pertmer makes sure to cover), and makes sure he teaches you in the simplest way possible. He makes the material very easy to understand as long as you pay attention, which isn't too hard because he doesn't drone and makes occasional jokes if he's in the mood.

That being said, if I could go back in time, I don't know if I'd take the H-version of this class. There's not much difference in the teaching, but there's a huge difference in the curve at the end. If you have a strong background in vectors, go for it - if not, I'd probably go for 102 regular.",667
pertmer,5,,ENES102,"Dr. Pertmer is an awesome professor. He was always very approachable and seemed to actually care about his students. He makes some funny jokes in class, and lectures are usually interesting. He covers the material very well. For each new topic he starts by introducing the topic, giving an outline of how to solve the kinds of problems for that topic, and does many examples (with the examples becoming progressively more complicated). I really enjoyed his class and would recommend that you take a class with this professor. You will always feel like you know what you're doing in this class, and can ask him for help any time you don't understand something.",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102,"I took this class 2 years ago, but I am in the mood to do this so here you go.

Pertmer is the Chuck Norris of statics. If I had to sum up one class where I SINCERELY feel like I got my money and time's worth out of, it would be statics with this guy. He is incredibly thorough with his notes, lays everything in a step by step manner, prepares you very well for exams and homeworks, and is actually very witty and hilarious if you listen close (he makes subtle jokes that most people miss.) You will really learn a lot if you put in the time here. I 1000 percent recommend.",667

Often, one can find examples in the textbook that look exactly like the homework problems.

note: the only difference between ENES102 and ENES102H (as far as I can tell) are the two weekly in-class problems that you do with a group, so definitely take the Honors version.",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102H,"Pertmer is a great teacher. Though sometimes the material is a little dreary, his examples are great and he really helps you understand what you are doing. The in class problems can be challenging, but he is happy to help out. The class overall is quite challenging and the homeworks are long and graded for accuracy. (harsh graders). Overall, I think he is a fantastic professor and I would recommend him to anyone who needs to take statics, and if you listen carefully you will notice that he is actually very funny.",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102,"This professor is great. He's not the most boring teacher, he throws in small jokes periodically that are usually subtle and hard to catch.

He's also very willing to answer a lot of questions, and usually does very well.",667

Although he's not as funny as Beigel, it's not a huge loss.",667
pertmer,4,A,ENES102,"He’s a great guy, really understanding and he explains concepts relatively well. He’s really generous with partial credit but unfortunately the exams are graded by many professors (Young is pretty stingy with partial credit). During class, pertmer’s examples can get a little drawn out and boring, but overall the class was good.",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102H,Covers the material well. Makes the typical physics jokes. He is helpful with explaining concepts after class if you did not understand something. Made the course fun and engaging.,667
pertmer,3,B+,ENES102,I thought this dude hated me for the first month of classes. I'd ask questions - not understand his answer - then he'd be done with me. Once he just completely ignored my question in class and waved me off. But I went to his office hours and turns our he's nice. Teaches really well.,667
pertmer,4,A-,ENES102,"Pertmer is a nice, funny, and thorough professor. His notes are clear, and straightforward. The only downside is that his example problems are more simple than in the homework and exams. Pertmer curves the class by dividing all grades by the highest percentage in the class which is really nice. Friday in class problems are difficult, but if you do the homework problems beforehand, it'll be easier.

All ENES 102 classes are taught the same content at the same time, so you can go to any teacher for help. ",667
pertmer,5,A,ENES102,"Dr. Pertmer was a great professor! Exams were very fair and directly reflected what was taught in class. Lectures were easy to follow. His class was also very well adapted to the online environment, and the way it was structure helped you learn the material better without stressing over quizzes (because there are no quizzes!) while also getting somewhat familiar with him and your classmates. Highly recommend him!",667
gabriel,5,A,ENCE424,"Good professor, easy class. Workload can be somewhat challenging, but not overwhelming. A few team presentations and papers and two (open book) exams.

A freebie for Project Management students.

scarcelli,1,,BIOE372,"The class is not a conventional statistics class, which is fine considering its applied to bioengineering. But where the class fell short is the professor. Scarcelli lacks the ability to explain the material well & his questions are bizarrely worded. He refuses to answer any questions that would clarify his confusing wording on exams. Avoid him.",673
scarcelli,1,C,BIOE372,"One of the worst professors I have ever had. Does not explain material well at all. He’s an awful teacher in general and should be avoided at all costs. Oh yeah, if you do have him for the final, have fun because he puts impossible questions to drop your grade. Thanks for a great Christmas gift!",673
baecher,5,A,ENCE100,"I was an undecided engineering major as a freshmen and because of randomly taking ence100 I confirmed civil engineering as my major just because of Baecher. The class was incredibly easy but did what it was designed to do: introduce the world of civil engineering for students. 
This guy is also a genius, he's in charge of many research projects. I don't know what he's like for upper level ence classes but I would try to take him just based off what I saw in ence100.",675
baecher,4,,ENCE100,"nice guy. class was easy, and theres a huge curve",675
fathy,1,P,ENME351,"I would give this professor ZERO stars, if possible. He is incredibly lazy. He spends the first 15 minutes of each lecture discussing ""objectives"" for each topic rather than teaching the material. He expects his students to learn everything from pre-lecture videos (which are lengthy) so that he does not have to teach during lecture. Moreover, he posts quizzes with incorrect answers. Fathy made a 10 question quiz, and two of them were answered incorrectly on his end. A friend of mine went to his office hours to sort out the issue, and he only fixed ONE of the two answers (after admitting his mistake). It does not take long to fix an ELMS quiz. His final exam (25% of the grade) is no partial credit. Fortunately, I can take a ""pass"" just to avoid focusing on his final. Avoid Fathy at all costs. You deserve more for your tuition money.",679
montas,5,A,BIOE241,"If you don't walk out of his class without having laughed your ass off, and 1 or 2 funny things to say, you have no soul whatsoever. I can't stress enough how hysterical this guy's mannerisms become after awhile. I didn't learn anything, but it was the easiest A I've ever had. It was worth it to go to class just to listen to his ridiculous and bizarre references to things that had absolutely nothing to do with the class.   He is my capstone adviser now. . . not sure if that was a good idea, but I bet it will be hilarious nonetheless.",680
montas,5,,BIOE241,"What a unique professor - this guy might be one of the craziest people I've ever met. He makes terrible jokes, and will randomly bust out into creepy laughter. However, BIOE241 is a decent course. I came into the course with zero programming experience, and have come out learning a lot. The course is divided into two halves - C, and then MATLAB. The class is ""easy"", but you still have to put work into it. All of the lecture notes are online, which are important to read. The tests were open note/internet (NOT open people) and were easy if you came to lecture, did the homework, and read the online notes. Every once in a while there would be some really challenging problem on the homework, but otherwise it was not bad.",680
montas,5,A,BIOE241,"hahaha funny guy and really approachable too. if you've taken C before, this class will be easy. if you havent, then the class will suck balls at least until you get to MATLAB. exams were open book, open notes, and open internet.",680
montas,5,,,"Very smart guy, class is enjoyable.  One of the few classes (BIOE471) I am taking this semester that students regularly attend. Still helpful to read the textbook because the class covers a lot of material. Exams are fair, aren't meant to be tricky, but tend to be long and require understanding the material well. Keep up with the hw because it does end up affecting your grade",680
montas,5,A,BIOE241,"Very funny and seemingly high on life all the time.

Montas was VERY helpful for homework and any other help you could ask for.

HW and projects were fair, easy if you had  help from him or the TA.",680
montas,4,A+,,"Dr. Montas is hilarious. Although he seems pretty whacked-out most of the time, he can be quite helpful if you can get him to focus on your question (might take a few tries). He definitely knows his stuff, and he's a great resource for questions about analog and digital electronics, as well as anything computer-related.

ENBE/BIOE 241 is a very easy class. The tests are open-book, open-note, and open-internet. He posts all of his lectures online, so you can look at them while you take his exams. Homeworks and project weren't hard, either.",680
montas,5,A+,,"Dr. Montas rocks. His class is really easy and its not really necessary to go to lectures, but he is a riot.  What other professor would share a pizza recipe with a class for 30 minutes? He really really knows his stuff and you can surprisingly learn quite a bit if you wanted to.",680
montas,3,A-,BIOE241,"Went to lecture only about 4 times.  Montas tends to ramble/mumble about MATLAB, C, the moon, or whatever else is on his mind that day.  He has a quirky sense of humor if you get it (I didn't).  Lectures are posted online.  There is a weekly homework assignment, midterm/final, and a project.  Midterm and final are open-internet/notes so they aren't really a problem.

If you already have had exposure to C and MATLAB, then this class isn't worth attending.  If you haven't, use your class time to read through Montas' notes instead of listening to him-you'll learn more.",680
montas,5,A,BIOE241,love this guy,680
takeuchi,4,B+,ENMA460,"He explains everything well and writes everything he says on the board so taking notes is easy and thorough. He's also always willing to stop and answer questions. 
Homeworks can be tough, but the previous year's solutions will usually have what you need. 
Tests are pretty tough, again find previous tests and solutions because he reuses a decent amount of stuff. 
Overall nothing special but he's a solid professor and his class is very fair. ",682
takeuchi,4,,ENMA460,"Pros:
-Explains everything thoroughly
-Class is organized and interesting (as much as an eng class can be)

Cons:
-Very little, if any, partial credit given
-Not very helpful over email",682
mayergoyz,5,A,ENEE474,"As others said, his exams are based on the material that he teaches during lectures. He does not follow any book so you will need to come to lectures and take good notes. His exams are easy (try understanding each equation in lectures, then memorizing will be easy), and you will learn a lot from his lectures. I highly recommend taking his class.",684
mayergoyz,5,A-,ENEE474,"Mayergoyz is an excellent professor, but don't mistake excellence for being easy.  The class is based off of 3 exams, and 2-3 HWs.  

The HWs are given in the 1st half of the semester (before November for fall && before April for Spring).  Following this, you have no more HW assignments in the class. 

There are 3 exams, two midterms & 1 final.  There's never a curve because the average on exams is usually around an 80%.  The exams are straight forward, and you know what will be on them going into the exam (nothing tricky whatsoever).  The catch is you have to know the material by heart, you have to know it like the palm of your hand.  You have to know it so well that when you see the question, you don't even think about it you just write.  Its a memorization style exam, no solving like you do in 303 or 322 per say.  

I just took the final in 474 and it literally took all of the 2 hours for me to finish.  I seriously maybe only took 5 mins total to relax my hand haha.

Overall, an excellent class to be in and you will learn A LOT!  ",684
mayergoyz,5,A,ENEE474,"Mayergoyz is a fantastic professor. Also, he has a spectacular accent. He is not easy, but he is good at facilitating your learning. All the homework is in the first half of the semester (which is a lot of work, but, for the second half you dont have nearly as much work) His lectures are easy to understand and follow, and if you take good notes and number equations like he does, it is easy to find things. Everything that is important he repeats multiple times and is very straightforward about everything. ",684

Tests/Quizzes are a little easier than homework, so that's a plus. ",685
herrmann,1,,ENME426,"Inconsiderate man. Does not respect his students. Is not honest. Is not an ethical person. Does not think in the best interests of his students. Does not value the time, money, effort, and sacrifice that people make to be in his class.",688
herrmann,5,B+,ENME426,"I would strongly recommend this class. Professor Herrmann is an excellent teacher, who knows the material well. This class had 4 assignments, and a final all weighted equally. Video lectures are posted online, so as the semester went on, attendance dropped but you could catch up from the videos. This is a pretty easy class with a high pass rate. Take it if you can.",688
herrmann,1,P,ENME607,"Dr. Herrmann is a respected expert in his field. This though does not help when students ask for specific help on items. If you are struggling, the help given is in the form of a telephone call for online students. This is a moot point on any math.",688
larsson,5,A-,ENME202,Very fun to listen to even though what he was talking about was mundane as hell. He will answer any questions you ask of him directly and he even gives the option of regrading. ,692
larsson,5,A-,ENME202,"Larsson was a pretty good teacher. Although the material gets kinda crammed throughout the last few weeks of class, if you do the homeworks without getting help unless you absolutely need it and you try in studios, you should get an A. ",692
baras,1,,ENEE660,"No doubt Prof. Baras is a great researcher. Unfortunately he's not interested in teaching the students. He has his own lecture notes for ENEE660. However the notes are not user friendly. There are a lot of typos, unconventional notations, and almost zero accompanying diagrams to help better understand the concepts. There is no logical flow and it lacks actual applications or examples. In terms of teaching, he is always late for class and finishes way over time. He didn't show up for a class without prior notice and didn't apologize. He basically reads the lecture notes in verbatim and criticizes students for not reading it. It's been six weeks and we are yet to receive an assignment. I really hope I will learn something useful from him or else I'll be wasting my time and money. In short, he's terrible. ",694
baras,1,,,"Only teacher I have ever given a one star too.  There was no syllabi, outline for any assignments and I have yet its finally and i have yet to get one grade back.  He assigned up a pop 5 page pager during finals week too.  He only showed up to maybe 5 of the classes all semester and make the TA teach the class but did not give the TA any control over the class.  How does that work? It doesn't.  He is also very disrespectful to students.  During our midterm presentation he showed up late to one of the groups presentation, criticized them for not having something which they did say before he came (TA started class) and then for the rest of the presentations was playing with his smart phones then asking questions that were clearly answered in peoples presentations.   ",694
cumings,4,A-,ENES100,"As a person, I genuinely liked Dr. Cumings, he's really a kind-hearted person and wants you to do well even if his teaching abilities aren't the best or the most organized. Yes, he'd spend at least a good half hour of our 1 hr 50 min lecture fiddling around trying to get his powerpoint up or figuring out what to teach us that day, so yes, his lectures were a bit useless. However, when we began working in the lab, he seemed like he genuinely cared about the success of the teams and gave our team some really good advice. My team was wildly unsuccessful, like we essentially couldn't get s**t to work. But he's extremely fair with grading and curves generously, so if you have this professor and a good hovercraft group (unlike me), you're totally set for this class.",695
cumings,4,B,ENES100,"He's a pretty good professor, and compared to other sections of ENES100 he grades favorably.  Lectures during the first half of the course were pretty boring, but they are going to be boring no matter who your professor is.  For the hovercraft milestones, Cumings was fair in his expectations for our hovercraft, and extended the deadline for a few milestones.  Overall I'd recommend him.",695
cumings,4,A,ENES100,"Definitely not as bad as other comments make him out to be. The lectures in the first half of the course can get a little dull, but they contain some helpful information for the midterm. We had a good TA who was able to come in after-hours to work on the hovercraft. As for grading, I would say Cumings is definitely fair, especially for presentations and reports, and he does curve.",695
cumings,1,B,ENES100,"The comment below pretty much sums up Professor Cumings.  He does not make himself available at all to help his students succeed in the class.  ENES 100 is a pretty straight forward class but his lectures are not helpful at all.  He has his doctorate and makes his presentations like he is still in high school.  He extends the due dates of assignments because the class cannot meet them but in the end, they become too close together and teams do not qualify for the competition.

Hope for a good TA if you have class with him.

Actually, just sign up for Evandro Calente instead because his groups are always the most prepared.",695
cumings,3,B-,ENES100,"I'm not sure if he knows what he is talking about half the time. He stutters all through lecture and tries to explain concepts, but doesn't really succeed.

I still haven't figured out what that was supposed to mean.",695

goldhar,3,A-,ENEE380H,"Honestly, hes a pretty bad professor. His lectures are practically worthless because they're too disorganized to follow, and if you're in the honors section, you don't even have the benefit of getting a TA to help you because he leads the discussion himself. The only reason I'm giving him 3 stars is because his tests are pretty easy. He grades very easily and will often give you full credit on a problem so long as you have the right idea, even if you made a couple computational errors. Overall I'd say his class isn't too bad but I'd try and find another professor if I was you.",702
goldhar,2,A-,ENEE205,"Goldhar was a very poor professor. His lectures were poorly put together, he was too scatterbrained to follow, and often made mistakes which he would not correct. His homework assignments were too long, and were much more intensive than what we ""learned"" in class, making them impossible without office hours. Labs were long and poorly put together; even the TA's didn't always know what was going on or understand why he put things a certain way. 

Exams were doable but frustrating nonetheless. He walked into our second exam and said ""I think I made this too easy."" The average for this exam was a 67%. In general, you can understand nothing that is going on in the class and cram for the exam and still do decent.

That being said, Goldhar is not the worst teacher at the University of Maryland, and his class is curved so that an 86% is a guaranteed A- (unless he curves more).

I would not recommend Goldhar to a friend, nor would I take a class with him again.",702

However, his homework problems are good and they're usually interesting to do. He gives matlab assignments which I thought was good because it's important to know how to use matlab. He is pretty good in office hours also. It's definitely important to have a good TA. Goldhar gives very reasonable tests though. They test you on relevant concepts and they're not pointlessly difficult. Definitely an easily passable class, but he's not that great of a teacher.",702
goldhar,2,A,ENEE381,"Goldhar constantly makes mistakes. everything he tells you is false. It is impossible to take notes on his lectures. If you do, you will not learn the material correctly. He posts slides (which he doesn't use in lecture) that are *mostly* correct, but not always. He gives out a lot of A's, but you dont learn anything. My understanding of the class is that a big part of what you are supposed to get out of it is how to use/read smith charts which Goldhar did not get to till half way through the semester. I would advise putting this class off till some other time if Goldhar is your only option. He is a nice guy at least... The book for the class is.. ok.. ",702
goldhar,1,B+,ENEE381,He doesn’t teach well in class. Going to class is useless. His class is basically a self-teaching class. Plus the problems on the exams are confusing. Avoid this Professor at all costs.,702

If you can't make it, he will accommodate at another time convenient for you. The homeworks are harder than the exams. The exams though are relatively straightforward and he doesn't throw in tricks in the problems. Review the lecture slides and the homework assignements and you will be fine.
He also holds a review before each exam so make sure you attend them since the exams questions are somewhat based on the concepts he emphasizes.
He also posts practice exams and problems which can help in exam prep. If you are willing to put in the work I would recommend taking him",702

She must have known our names and marked us down if we weren't paying attention, though. I got some bad quiz grades even if I completed it.

I am not one of those people who goes to office hours and tries to talk to my professor because frankly I don't usually need to and don't care, but Kevin is someone who I know actually cares about how well I do and how much I learn and is approachable and helpful.  He is one of the few engineering professors who is actually a good person as well as amazing teacher and I 100% recommend him to anyone for any course that he teaches.",711

However, he is a rather strict grader and gave almost no curve in the class even though there was one exam where our class average was 10% lower than both the other teacher's class averages. I ended up getting a B despite doing very well throughout the semester and I would've imagined I was at least top 15% in the class.",711
calabro,5,,ENES100,"Calabro is a pretty good lecturer. He knows how to teach the material very well. This thing is that he is a bit quiet and dry at times, especially if you have prior knowledge of the material. 
Calabro gives out a lot of 4/5’s on parts of reports if they are not perfect, which, in almost all cases, they aren’t. Our team got a 77 percent on the first report, and that was the highest grade in the class. He will rip apart your report and presentation for all possible flaws. Its for your own good though. You have been warned…

Don't think that just because there are 50% A's, doesn't mean you can slack off in this class. The hovercraft project is a pain at first. You will easily spend hours with your team planning the hovercraft, building it, and testing it. It helps a lot to have someone who can program on your team because it is difficult to learn about programming if you have no knowledge.

He is, however, as stated in another review extremely harsh when grading presentations and design reports, you most likely will not get an A on these assignments, because he is very nit-picky.  For example, in my preliminary design report, I got so many points taken off for formatting in regards to where captions should be for a table versus a figure.

As long as you work hard in the class you should be able to get an A.

The first half of the semester in enes100 was very time consuming between required special lectures (outside of class), homework, and team meetings (designing the hovercraft).  Depending on how productive your team is, meetings can take huge chunks of your time.  When the midterm comes around, study hard, it is important.

The second half of the semester is great.  Class time is reserved for working on your hovercraft, and you probably need very few, if any, team meetings.

Kevin really cares about how well your team does and is happy to help if you ask him.  He grades presentations and the PDR harshly because there is plenty of room for improvement.  Regardless, it doesn't really destroy your grade.  If you put in the effort on your team and show that you care about the project, you'll do well, and probably enjoy the class.",711
calabro,2,,ENES100,he grades really hard on your group presentations. plus the midterm is extremely hard. I failed the midterm and did average on the presentations. I got a B in the class. he emphasizes how your hovercraft team and their evaluations have a huge impact on your grade but it really doesnt affect it that much. He is the hardest enes100 teacher. ,711
calabro,4,A,ENES102H,"Calabro is a relatively good statics teacher, but some people have a hard time with him. He talks in a monotone, but if you pay attention, his lectures are really good and you can learn everything in class. I have never had to study outside of class. The exams are not that difficult if you know the material. If you can get Fourney, go for him, but otherwise Calabro is good choice.",711
calabro,3,B,ENES100,"Arguably the most difficult ENES100 teacher. Just do your HW, do decent on the midterm, and well on your hovercraft.",711
calabro,4,B,ENES100,Probably the hardest ENES100 teacher. Grade really depends on how well your Hovercraft group does on its presentations. ,711
calabro,4,B,ENES100,"He is a good teacher. He does grade much harder and thoroughly than the other teachers. Kevin (as he asks to be called) probably prepares you best for the midterm, which is a major chunk of your grade. ",711
calabro,5,A-,ENES232,"Kevin is probably one of the best engineering professors I’ve had the pleasure of taking. Understand, however, that Thermodynamics is not by any means a pushover class, and so expect to struggle through problems that sometimes take hours. Kevin’s philosophy about homework’s is that if you struggle through it and complete harder questions on your own then you’ll be very well prepared for the exams, which could not be more true. Throughout the class I thought to myself “man this is just a huge pain in the ass why do I have to do this?” Then came the first midterm and I got an A. Material ramps up in difficulty, homework’s are even more irritating and challenging, then came the second midterm and I got an even higher grade. I honestly don’t think I would’ve done half as well in this class had I had any other professor. Always take Kevin if you can.",711
calabro,2,A-,HONR288O,"content is interesting but mans calibro is way too harsh on grading...

you also wont know your grade for this class, i have anywhere from a C to an A- depending on how generous calibro is feeling",711
calabro,5,A,ENES100,"Kevin is awesome. He cares about all his students and wanted us to still do well, even when our OSV had about a million problems. He makes a hard class fun, and if you truly deserve an A you will get one.",711
calabro,5,A,ENES221,"I definitely recommend Kevin for any class he's teaching. For this class, his notes and examples were clear and he taught very well. 221 is not easy, but if you put in effort and take the time to learn the material and ask questions, you will do fine. The last 232 review does a great job describing him.",711
calabro,4,B,ENES221,"Calabro was a fairly good teacher for this extremely challenging course. He always was thorough with his examples in class, and his lecture videos and notes were posted shortly after class ended. Calabro did the best he could with an online course by providing ways to review for exams and being helpful during his office hours. Calabro's exams seemed fairer than the other professors teaching this Fall semester.

For the course as a whole, they switched the grading system to be the same way as ENES 232, and that brought a whole load of challenges. The most frustrating thing is the strictness of what they consider partial credit which is the reason most students scored low on exams. Due to the change in grading, teachers and TAs ended up taking much longer to grade group works and homework assignments and grades were not updated as frequently as students would like. 

This semester, they also switched the homework website to a new website. Although it was free, the website regenerates the problem after each attempt. The homework problems sometimes required a lot of work, so if you get it wrong, you have to start all over again. Also, homework was much harder than the exams and examples in the notes. My advice: find a group to work and study together with and you will be okay",711
calabro,5,A+,ENES100,"Kevin's an extremely approachable guy and you can tell he loves what he does. He was always adamant that if we do good work, the good grades will follow.",711
foecke,2,A+,ENES100,"I do not recommend you take this professor for ENES100. He grades very leniently and is kind/understanding, however he completely skipped the lecture material for the first 8 weeks of class. Some students might prefer this, but I found it detrimental to my team's progress on the OSV. The online lessons aren't very useful, so having the traditional in class lectures would have benefited my section greatly in terms of learning.",712
foecke,5,A,ENES100,Foecke is a great and very understanding professor. He has a lot of industry experience so he constantly related what he taught to the real world.,712

dai-hattrick,5,B+,ENMA300,"Dr. Dai-Hattrick is a pretty good lecturer, but she really excels at explaining things thoroughly during her office hours. This class has a straightforward workload: homeworks due once a week and milestones for the group project due every month or so (this was during online classes so it might be different for others). The exams are pretty hard and fast-paced, make sure you prepare for them well in advance. She does curve at the end of the semester. Make sure to go to her office hours because she can be extremely helpful and will take as much time as you need to figure things out.",718
martinez-miranda,1,A,ENMA300,"Only take a class with her if you have no other options for teachers. The class will be easy (helped by her ridiculous grading policies), but you won't learn anything.

She's a mediocre teacher at best, and seems to have no clue how to ""connect the dots"" and tie in older material to new stuff you're learning. She doesn't really seem to care much about her students, and to top it off is pretty difficult to understand.",721
martinez-miranda,2,A,ENES100,"The course is easy and she does try really hard to help but you will get annoyed with the word ""actually"" by the end of the course.  As long as you show that you are trying you will get an A.",721
martinez-miranda,2,A,ENES100,"This class was a typical intro engineering course.  However, Martinez-Miranda made the class much more difficult to understand than it should have been.  She was a nice enough person and gave a good percentage of A's, but she was impossible to understand.  She said actually more times each lecture than a normal person would in a lifetime.  I you have a choice, go with another professor.",721
martinez-miranda,1,A,ENES100,"Note: the rating is for the professor, not the course in general.

The course itself is your typical rite-of-passage intro engineering course. However, this is one of those classes where you have to put in WAYYY too much work outside of class (about 3-4 hours per week OUTSIDE of class). At least Martinez-Miranda was pretty lenient with the A's.

Now as for her...Where do I begin? IMPOSSIBLE to understand during lectures. Repeats herself way too much. I counted one time. She said the word ""actually"" 120 times in the span of one hour. I literally learned nothing from her class. If you're doing Materials Science, I'm sorry. If you're not, then STAY AWAY!",721
massoud,2,,ENME430,"Mahmood is a very nice man, but not an effective teacher.  Part of this is likely due to online learning since he isn't very tech savy, but he would rarely stay focused on the content of the class during lectures.  If there is an option to take a class Professor Massoud is teaching with another professor I would recommend doing so",723
raissi-dehkordi,4,A,ENPM693,Was a bit unorganized and the TA's took some time to grade the HWs. ,724
raissi-dehkordi,5,,ENPM693,"Professor MR is ""old school"" in the good way. He tailors his courses to get essence of it instead bothering you with irrelevant parts. I learned a lot from him. I highly recommend all the courses that he teaches.",724
marcus_steven,5,B,ENEE322,"Marcus was a great professor. He genuinely tries to cater to the needs of his students. He even gave us a survey mid-semester to gauge how he could improve the class for the remainder of the semester. 

He also provides a lot of material to study from. For most exams, he has 4+ previous exams with solutions written out. His exams are difficult, but not impossible given the resources that are available. 

Homework is given with solutions, so it is up to you to decide whether you need the practice. ",725
marcus_steven,5,A,ENEE324,"He is by far the smartest, most helpful and interesting professor I've had at UMD. His exams are tough but fair. He has homework available online along with the solutions and the exams are based on material covered on homework. I took him for 322 and 324 and he was a wonderful teacher. Plenty of office hours, and his office hours are actually fun.
Definitely take him. ",725
marcus_steven,5,A-,ENEE324,"Marcus is a very good professor that sets up the class for us to do well. He posts the homework and solutions at the same time so you get immediate feedback, which is nice because the homework problems would have been impossible without the solutions. But don't just blindly copy from the homework solutions, because you don't learn the material. 
He explains the material pretty well and VERY responsive to student feedback. He is one of the nicest and most dedicated professors when it comes to teaching. Exams aren't easy but aren't too terribly difficult if you work MIT sample exams. The grade distribution was scattered all over the place with averages in the 50's-60s. He tends to throw one or two problems from the homework or recitations. The exams are “doable” but sometimes they are long for the time given. I feel like they were hard to prepare for but just work a ton of problems to the point where you can approach a problem without really thinking how to do it.
You really need to put in the time to do well. He is definitely one of the better professors in the ECE department, but you need to take advantage of the resources he provides/suggests to do well. Just don't make the mistake that just because he's very nice and responsive to student concerns means mean he will curve a lot; he doesn't

marcus_steven,1,,ENEE322,The old reviews were far from his most recent teaching performance. This professor does not teach well and does not care about his students. His exams are extremely hard and he does not curve. ,725
marcus_steven,5,A,ENEE322,"Probably the best professor I've ever had at UMD. I had taken ENEE322 in spring 2018, and he definitely still cared about his students. He was the only professor I've had do a survey half way through the class to see how he was doing as a professor. He's also the only professor who provides the homework solutions with the homework so that you can use it as a guide to figure out difficult problems, get full credit on the homework, and use it to study for the exam. There was a curve as well. The exams are very difficult, but very fair (there was only one trick problem on the final exam that was explicitly reviewed in the review session that I couldn't attend).",725

-Can't teach
-Bad attitude
-Does not know how to use a PC

Pros:
-Easy tests/homework assignments


Try to study Java before you start taking this class. The course goes very very fast. 
",727
austin,4,A,ENCE200,"Austin is a nice guy and he can be very funny.  He can come across as grumpy or arrogant in class some times but he is usually just kidding.  

His lectures can be very interesting but he doesn't teach you all you need to know about programing.  He makes you figure it out on your own.  After all, isn't this what engineers are supposed to do?  Your best bet is to either use the internet and look up how things work or go see him in his office.  I heard he is very helpful but make sure you have some work to show.  

The first exam is fairly easy if you get some practice exams but don't give up on java because you did well on the first exam.  The final is a killer but if you learn java (do the homework yourself, not your comp. sci. friend) and look at the diagrams in his notes you should get an A.",727
austin,2,B,ENCE200,"Austin is a nice guy, and is very flexible with his office hours, but the lectures are often boring, and do not really reflect what is on the homework, but are necessary for exam preparation (especially the ones that are open notes). The homeworks are extremely long and complicated, it is useful to know somebody that is a computer science major, especially if its your first exposure to programing. 
The exams are very similar to the old ones. He is always looking for a very specific answer, often just one word in the answer, for full credit. The diagrams he draws on the board are crucial, most of them he will want you to replicate on the exams. 

And lastly, he loves macs.",727
austin,2,,ENCE200,"Not the most amazing teacher I've ever had.  The tests are almost identical to past exams, which are in the course reader (which is now 40 bucks!).  Material isn't too hard, but can be tricky if it's your first exposure to it (like it was for me) because he doesn't always explain things very well.  
Another thing you should know about him is that he's practically a walking, talking Mac advertisement.  If you're a PC person (like me), he doesn't even know how to help you sometimes, much less be willing to.  
Class is alright, but I can't say the same for him.",727
austin,4,A,ENCE200,"overall mediocre teaching; lecture wasn't always helpful for homework and exams. However, Austin is usually lenient in grading and tends to give VERY similar exams from year to year (if not identical), so study the old exams that he includes in the blue course reader and you will be fine.",727
austin,3,,ENCE200,"the class really wasnt that hard, although he is literally no help to anyone on the homework assignments. the class reader he uses may seem like its not worth 30 bucks, but it actually is. the book contains copies of past exams that he gave. study and master those exams and you will do well. also network with people on the homework.",727
fuge,2,B,ENME392,Weak professor. He has been consistently behind in lecture meaning we need to learn how to do most of the HW on our own then have him go over it the following week. Only upside is that for my class each lecture was streamed and saved so we could access it later.,728
fuge,4,A,ENME392,Dr. Fuge is a really interesting professor and extremely friendly. This class is very difficult but he does his best to explain the material. He is definitely better than most of the other stat professors in the department in my opinion.,728
fuge,1,,ENME392,"One of the more poorly set-up classes I've taken. Not the best teaching style to try and implement in an online environment. Maybe he is better in person, but it was hard to understand these concepts over Zoom.",728
fuge,1,,ENME392,"Possibly the worst setup class taken, ever. I was awfully surprised at the lack of organization and support. At least the TA's and TF's are good. 
Dr. Fuge is friendly, helpful at times, but goes on way too many tangents that can lead to more confusion. ",728
fuge,1,,ENME392,This was baaaaad. Asynchronous time made students even more confused and feedback was ignored. The averages on our exams were well below passing and I learned very little this semester.,728
fuge,1,,ENME392,"This is by far the worst course I’ve taken at UMD. The professors are incompetent, constantly retracting their own statements and overall a complete disgrace to the university. The course layout is awful and inefficient. We are expected to watch all lecture videos and do homework before coming to class which begs the question, Why even come to class? Furthermore the professors instruct us to asks further questions on Piazza, which they have frequently neglected to answers for multiple days on pressing issues. Cuckier is frequently wrong in his demonstrations which only further confuses students, while Fuge insults is by only asking for “high level questions” Lastly, no one can ever seem to give a straight answer without having to “confer” which in other words means they will never tell you the answer and are dodging the question. The worst part of all is the use of prarie learn. Each question must be completed twice to get full credit but if a student doesn’t complete one single part of a question, they have no way of earning any points on the second attempt. Furthermore the exams use instant feedback which i will admit is nice, but the professors don’t even bother with partial credit which destroys all hope of earning credit for displaying what you know.",728
fuge,1,,ENME392,"I really wish I could give zero stars for this, but I can't. This course allowed me to get a glimpse of what Hell actually looks like. There is no organization for this class. This semester was a flipped classroom setting which was just awful. Many of the homework processes that they show in class are wrong, but Fuge will deny that it's wrong. The exams were online and there was no partial credit. The averages on the exams were around a D every time, and there are too many long questions on the exams for the small amount of time given. Also, if you ask a question through Piazza or via email you won't get a response ever or you have to wait 3-5 business days. I believe that this course was meant to set students up for failure. Welcome to Hell if you're going to take this course.",728
shayman,4,,ENEE324,"Pretty good professor overall. Homeworks were very reasonable and he was very clear on what to expect on exams. Only downside is that his lectures will put you to sleep, although any professor teaching 324 might do the same. ",730
shayman,4,,ENEE324H,"He's not a bad professor honestly. He does a good job of teaching you the material and can be quite helpful in his office hours. His lectures can be kind of dense, but that's just because of the nature of the course; there's a lot of material to cover.

My biggest problem with this guy is that he gives absolutely no partial credit, which can really hurt you on the exams. The average in my honors section was a D going into the final because of this. If you get stuck with Shayman, you will learn a lot, but if you're worried about your GPA, I'd recommend someone else.",730
shayman,2,,ENEE322,Found his lectures difficult to follow and he's a little condescending when you ask questions. I heard this from a lot of people I talked to in my class as well. He doesn't seem to know how to explain things to students who don't immediately get it.,730
shayman,4,B+,ENEE322,"Shayman is pretty decent. Lectures are followable and neatly written if a bit dry (like his throat). Homework was doable and kept you paced. Exams were fair/a bit tough but if you knew the material well you could do well. His pop quizzes were annoying, but they basically counted for nothing so it was no big deal. Plus his curve was pretty good. There might be better choices for 322 like Marcus, but I think Shayman is a pretty good option.",730

cukier,1,AB,ENME392,"This is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. 

Homework assignment on the second half of the semester to up to 10 hours to do. And they had nothing to do with the exams because you cant use excel on the exams, but he expects you to know how excel calculated it and for you to show it on the exam. 

He did not give ANY practice exams. We all just groped in the dark, guessing for questions for practice. I think he's lazy and tries to recycle materials from semester to semester and doesn't want students to see the past ones. 

Also he does not give you your exams back. If grading was incorrect you will never know about it. He makes the exams cumulative but he doesn't give you back exams so you have no idea what you need to work on more for the next exam.

The formal sheet he gives you for the exams have nothing labeled. If you don't know what the equation is for already you are pretty much screwed.

Summary: Way too much work for a 3 credit class. Hard exams that are even harder to study for. ",739
cukier,2,,ENME392,"Wow Frostea took the words straight out of my mouth... 

His own HW problems are horrendously awful and take incredibly long to complete (HW is worth 25% of your grade). Like Frostea said, you *waste* half your time figuring out what he wants!

The TA's were such a blessing. I wish Mary was teaching the class.. 

This is the worst class I've ever taken and statistics is an incredibly important subject. Its a shame this guy is so awful, avoid him like the plague. 

Dr. Barker teaches this class sometimes, he's an excellent professor. 
",739
cukier,2,B,ENME392,"I honestly get the impression he is teaching this course not out of desire, but necessity. 

Be *very* careful with this teacher; he purposefully quickly glosses over information and AVOIDS explaining it when he intended to have a clicker question on it or emphasize it on the exam. This isn't always the case, but often is. 

He is very passive aggressive in his teaching style. When he makes a mistake on his custom made homework problems since he worded it unnecessarily vaguely, he says it's your fault for not assuming X, Y, or Z, when it could very well be that the assumption could be invalid if you interpret the data differently. 

Students actively argue with him about his homework problems, which are often UNNESSARY. If he assigned just book problems, they would be bearable. But a HUGE amount of time always goes into trying to interpret his custom problems, NOT into actually applying the material. 

I did very well on the first exam but awful on the second exam as I had ZERO sleep due to staying up all night trying to play catch up for my other classes after one of his god awful homeworks that I had to spend my entire weekend + monday in order to complete with some understanding of the material. So I was a complete wreck for his exam. 

In a nutshell: he has a very typical professor-complex where he considers his class the only one in existance and expects you to ""get rid of conflicts"" if you can't attend the problem solving sessions on friday. Sorry sir, you cannot ask a student to drop classes just to attend the friday sessions. That is not only egotistical but also unethical. This a 3 credit class that you assign 6-9 credits worth of work per week. 

I've researching the necessary paperwork to report this teacher to the academic board; his unethical practices are negligent and destructive. If you do not like to teach, please leave. I shouldn't pay you tons of money to berate us in class. ",739
cukier,2,,ENME392,"This guy is a horrible lecturer.  His lectures don't help (learning from the book is better) and he is bad at answering questions.  When asking questions during class, he will be easily confused with your question and probably give you a BS answer like ""it depends what you're doing"" and continue on with lecture. 

He gives the worst clicker questions at the end of his lectures (usually 2 or 3 questions) which are on some mundane detail of his lecture he went over for 30 seconds. These count for 5% of your grade (syllabus is not clear).  

He gives more homework than my other engineering classes (like 12-20 problems per week along with analyzing raw data).  Also, he'll take off 2% of your final grade if you don't pick up your homework from his office.  Seriously, wtf??

Tests are tricky on purpose, so you'll need to be very careful reading the problem over and over.  They are long and you'll need to be proficient to finish on time.

He does hold problem solving sessions on Fridays (can't go to them because of class), but I hear they are largely useless like his lectures. 

Overall, one of the worst professors I've had, especially for a course that needs a lot of careful explanation.",739
cukier,3,A,ENME392,"Michel is a difficult professor to put a grade to.

His lectures are largely useless even though he does put them online.  They are very scattered and doesn't show work, so often it looks like he just jumps to the answer with no explanation.  

The worst part of the lectures was the clickers at the end.  There are 2 questions that are graded as quizzes.  The questions are usually about some very minuscule detail and his wording is sometimes very unclear.  If you have him, I recommend bringing the textbook or his lecture notes and looking up the answers because he allows this.

Sample exams: ""How do you mean sample exams?"" was one of his quotes from the year. He does not give sample exams and his regular exams are very hard and curves them to around a 75% average.

Homework: Gives a lot of homework but pays more attention to effort, though the correct answer does count.

Availability: He makes himself very available to students and is very approachable and a nice guy, and is always willing to help out students.

His accent was somewhat of a barrier, but once you learn what certain words are, it's not too bad.

The curve at the end seemed pretty large because the average grade was very low. I'm sure you could do worse than Cukier, but I'm sure you could do better as well.",739
cukier,1,B,HACS200,"""Dumpster fire"" barely suffices to describe the horror of this course.

TLDR: 
course: absolute train-wreck, 0/10 would not take again. The students being so happy that a course is over is really something.
instructor: performance beyond awful in running the course and for encouraging p-hacking. Would rate 0 stars if I could.

First and foremost, this was way to much work for a 2cr 200-lv course.

Lack of documentation / spec doesn't help either. 
Using MITM software provided by the course staff is virtually required, which wouldn't be too bad except for the fact that it's broken and lacks documentation.
Important bug fixes to it were made multiple weeks into the semester, and the entire setup relies on deprecated packages, so updating breaks it.
Even after those fixes, it's still bugged. (This is treating the ""it's a feature, not a bug"" aspects as features)

Next up is asinine / lack of grading criteria. 
Initially, assignments at least had rubrics provided. (Marking in adherence to the rubrics, not so much)
Peer reviews were used to give feedback (rather than instructional staff) for a large assignment early on, which wouldn't be an issue if the peer review comments correlated with the marks given.
Grades were assigned here pretty arbitrarily, using justifications like 'this section was not 2 pages' (paraphrased) to deduct points from groups that had slightly above 2 pages as well as those with slightly below.
With margins though, no group could possibly have exactly 2 pages. 

Early on, there were also marks for more subjective things like presentations, for which grades were not released until months later.
The thing is, no rubric was used in grading these -- just ""a general feel[ing]"" (direct quote). (???) This is MONTHS after the actual presentation! 
I barely remember what my teammates talked about, much less little details of other groups; there is no way the course staff remembers details sufficient to assign meaningful grades months later.

When confronted about this, though, they doubled down and refused to provide grading criteria for the final presentation/paper.
Now, rumor has it that Dr. Cukier was attempting (successfully?) to make the course appear ""rigorous"" by assigning low grades.
I personally have no evidence of this one way or another, but consider this case:

The course staff told students that our proposals (worth about 20% of the overall grade) would be rejected and we would be asked to repeatedly revise them if they were not sufficiently well written.
However, one entire group's proposal was accepted and subsequently scored 11.3/20 (probably 11.25 actually due to ELMS rounding) -- an F (mean was 15.3/20). 
""F denotes failure to understand the subject and unsatisfactory performance."" An unsatisfactory proposal should have been rejected, no? 

While other students undoubtedly have a long list of grievances about this course, I'll just touch on this one.
He actively encouraged p-hacking (see https://xkcd.com/882/) to groups who initially failed to reject their null hypotheses.
This included suggesting ""regrouping the data"" and even as far as ""just looking at one week [of 1-2 months worth]"" (paraphrased).
This is questionable at best, and most researchers view it as cheating in the experiment -- perhaps just shy of scientific fraud.",739
cukier,1,,ENME392,"This is by far the worst course I’ve taken at UMD. The professors are incompetent, constantly retracting their own statements and overall a complete disgrace to the university. The course layout is awful and inefficient. We are expected to watch all lecture videos and do homework before coming to class which begs the question, Why even come to class? Furthermore the professors instruct us to asks further questions on Piazza, which they have frequently neglected to answers for multiple days on pressing issues. Cuckier is frequently wrong in his demonstrations which only further confuses students, while Fuge insults is by only asking for “high level questions”   Lastly, no one can ever seem to give a straight answer without having to “confer” which in other words means they will never tell you the answer and are dodging the question. The worst part of all is the use of prarie learn. Each question must be completed twice to get full credit but if a student doesn’t compete one single part of a question, they have no way of earning any points on the second attempt. Furthermore the exams use instant feedback which i will admit is nice, but the professors don’t even bother with partial credit which destroys all hope of earning credit for displaying what you know.",739
skibniewski,4,A,ENCE421,Not as bad as the others said. 421 is an interesting class. Skibniewski talks a lot about his funny experiences during his career. There is also a wonderful field trip in 420. Basically really nice!,744

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND not taking any course with him as he reads over power points, the homework assignments are hard and does't teach you what he expects to be completed on the homework.  The book is not much help either. 

The class is also extremely boring.  

STAY AWAY FROM 420! ",744

Class average ended up being a C. He did nothing to curve it. Since this class was an elective, it was a little irritating that he was being such a harsh grader.

TAKE ANY OTHER PROJECT MANAGEMENT CLASS OTHER THAN THIS.",744
al-sheikhly,2,A,ENMA422,"ENMA422 itself is an easy class. Three homeworks, a take home midterm, a final and most of the assignments are partner work. Getting an A was pretty easy. 
Al-Sheikhly doesn't allow any electronics in class and always takes attendance, which kinda sucks because his lecturing is extremely sub-par and fairly repetitional. He also had a really large focus on polymers for the second part of the course.
As for the man himself, he's pretty much just a cranky old man. He can be mean and yell for no reason, and rarely answers questions adequately if he even tolerates them. Getting on his good side is hard and may not help that much, but should still be attempted. 
If he still does a project in the future, just go to his office hours and ask him for a topic. Otherwise you risk public humiliation as he rips apart your preliminary presentation in front of the whole class, without any response allowed. 
Of course if you're a girl, this doesn't apply. He'll love you regardless. 

Overall if you can stomach his personality, the class is easy enough that I would recommend it. ",745
al-sheikhly,1,A-,ENME382,"The teaching was pretty poor. Professor was condescending to students, and it was hard to take notes during class because he would just talk and it was unclear what we should write. He took off points on exams for what it seems emotional reasons--stating that the answer wasn't good enough, without actually looking at what some of us wrote. He also took off full points on some questions because we wrote exactly what he wrote on a slide, and he thinks that we should ""read the book""(which I did/do), not just look at the slides. Nevertheless the answer was correct, but his irrational reasoning led to getting full points off. 

He is also just a very difficult person to deal with. Not very available after class and he gives no respect to any student. He says we should discuss together during class, because that is the point of class, but many times he will tell people to put their hands down or just shut them down by saying, ""Are you even paying attention??"". So overall, the professor is disrespectful, doesn't teach well, and is irrational.",745

goldsman,5,A,ENEE307,"Goldsman is awesome! 307 is a pretty laidback class. There were labs due every two weeks, but if you work hard one week, you don't have to come the next week, which is nice if you have an 8 am lab. Lectures are pretty useful, even moreso than the 245 lectures, where Goldman basically reviews 303 stuff, so it is recommended you go if you don't have a grasp of the material. Midterm and final were pretty straightforward, he has review sessions and posts old exams. 

Overall a relatively pain-free class class, try to take him over Newcomb if you can.",752
goldsman,4,A,ENEE307,"He seems like a cool guy, and he lectures at a reasonably pace at review sessions, but during the normal 50-min lectures, he tends to rush and go through material at a dizzying rate. His notes can become an incoherent scrawl and he tries to race through his notes and diagrams. He's also a bit touchy about students talking during his lectures.

The actual lab is pretty easy, and of course, depends mainly on how your TA is. Malfunctioning parts/breadboards/probes were an issue though. The midterm and final are straightforward, and basically test the same material as the posted practice exams. 

His lectures vary in usefulness, especially since, due to lab scheduling, you may be covering topics in lecture that you've already encountered in the lab itself, but going to reviews is vital.",752
goldsman,5,A,ENEE307,He is a good professor who knows how to teach this course. He explains the material well and his exams are straight forward. But he really need to pick up right TAs for this course. My TA graded lab reports not on the quality of work but his gradidng formula depended on if he liked the student or not. Other than that Prof. Goldsman is a very good teacher. Highly recommend him for ENEE307.  ,752
goldsman,5,A,ENEE704,"I thought I understood microelectronic device physics but after taking this course, I realized my prior understanding was superficial.  Goldsman is really good at conveying material in both a conceptual and detailed manner.  He doesn't use any notes, yet his lectures stayed organized and focused, and he writes everything on the board so it was easy to follow him and still take good notes.  The projects were challenging and time-consuming, but they were specifically designed to complement and apply the core material without redundancy. ",752
goldsman,4,A,ENEE313,"I had goldsman for 307 and 313. He is pretty reasonable about moving things around and stuff if there are conflicting tests in other classes or anything like that. Sometimes it is hard to keep up in lecture because he makes a lot of little mistakes when writing things down (even while he explains them correctly) He does not speak in a cryptic way like out of a textbook and is not bad at explaining concepts. he makes an effort to learn peoples names that participate or whatever which is nice. Tests are not that bad, they are for the most part very straightforward and he doesnt try to trick you or anything. for 307 his lectures didnt keep up with the labs so i stopped going because he was lecturing on the stuff we had learned the week before, but hey. its a lab. its mostly on you to figure it all out anyways. it did help that i had an excellent TA for both 307 and 313.

goldsman,3,,ENEE307,"He definitely knows his stuff, but I never went to lectures enough to greatly benefit from them.

At least he's not as bad as Peckerar.",752
goldsman,3,B,ENEE307,"Knows his material but takes forever to review labs in lecture.

The grading for the midterm was extremely harsh and the grading for the final is very similar. Averages hovered around the mid 40s.

When these supposedly ""trivial"" midterms and finals add up to half your grade, and the material is difficult stuff to absolute memorize and master, there is an issue with the course management.

This is a 2-credit course for goodness sakes, how can half the class get Cs????? He grades on a bell curve, so so disastrous and unreasonable.",752
goldsman,5,A,,"Goldsman is super nice, know his stuff, and is good at teaching it. I retained almost nothing from 303, but his lab manual/textbook presents almost all of the same info from 303 in a much more concise and easier to understand way. The labs were online for F20 in SPICE which took some getting used to. The labs took a while to complete and people tended to fall behind. Genuinely don't know how people did them in person since building circuits in a simulation seems like it would take much less time. He got rid of exams and instead added one or two additional parts to the labs that were challenging but interesting. Overall, highly recommend taking 307 with Goldsman",752
goldsman,4,A,ENEE313,"Goldsman is in general a solid teacher and a very nice guy. His homework and CAD assignments (while lengthy) helped with learning the material well. His exams were decently straightforward, without any confusing or gotcha questions. One gripe I had about the exams was that they were quite long, so I ended up taking up almost all of the allotted time. I appreciated that he got rid of the final exam this semester and made the final assignment a short MOSFET CAD assignment instead. 

His handwriting is mostly readable, but gets worse over the course of the lecture as he begins to up the pace of his writing. And as others have noted, he sometimes says the correct thing while writing something else on the board. But he would generally fix it promptly if someone brought it up. The pacing of the lectures was mostly followable, but he would sometimes think that he was explaining things too slowly and try to speed things up. Not many people agreed that he was going too slowly, so we were able to keep his pacing manageable. ",752
mogul,5,A,ENEE200,"ENEE200 isn't really a class to worry that much about in general, but it was very enjoyable wunder Nicole's instruction.

Interesting lectures, including a lot of video content, and a lot of thought-provoking conversatio about Ethics in Engineering. Great class!

Short essay due every week (Friday night for my class), but they're pretty simple to do. There is a bit of reading to do for the class, but that's just characteristic of ENEE200. Nicole pushed her final to the last day of class so that there wasn't a final during finals week, so that was nice. She also handed out candy the class before halloween, which was also nice.",754

She is passionate about the material, and that passion translates to everyone else in the class. The class is not very much work and her expectations are totally reasonable.

I would take the course if you want an easy Gen Ed and are an engineering major, but there are plenty of better and easier Gen Ed classes to take. Honestly, this class is a lot of writing and extremely easy, but it was a struggle to take her seriously during lectures, especially when she cuts of students answers mid-sentence, embarrassingly directs her anger at the Assistant Dean of the Engineering IT Staff for her technology not working, and for her ridiculously useless assignments.

Abshire is a great teacher who wants nothing more than for students to understand the material. She uses powerpoint slides, which aren't my favorite, but I'll admit that they're probably the right way to go to convey the large amount of material in the course. 

The class is tough, and the homeworks are super challenging. The tests are doable but you're expected to do several pretty big problems per exam / final, so come practiced and prepared. Partial credit is important on the exams, so write down everything you know. She does an ELMS quiz per lecture.

She also fell asleep during the final presentations of our class even though the majority of the class had pulled an all nighter and managed to stay awake.

abshire,5,A,,"I believe she taught this course very well. She assigns comprehensive homeworks that would require a lot of time to complete, fortunately, she makes herself available to students almost everyday for questions relating to homeworks and projects. The tests are fairly straight forward. The average on our first midterm was in the low 70s, and the average on the final was also in the 70s. The only problem I have with this class is that she would sometimes go over slides too quickly, and this would result in learning the material on your own through the book (not the easiest read). Overall, I recommend taking this course if you enjoy topics in microelectronics/Integrated circuits. ",759

Prof. Abshire's a very good lecturer, and she tries very hard to make herself available to students with questions about the course material.  The only slightly negative thing about her is that she will sometimes go a little fast through her Power Point slides.  If you are ever unclear on something, or just want to stall so you can grasp the concept she just presented, just ask her a question.  She usually gives really good explanations, and this will slow the pace of the class.  Moreover, she happens to be a really nice person and her research is really cool, so if you ever want to do a 499 with someone, I would definitely recommend her over most other professors.  ",759

The biggest complaint I have about her is the grading. She took over a month to grade the midterm, and three weeks to grade the final exam. By the time of the final day to withdraw from a course with a W, we only had quiz grades (automatically graded) and one or two homework grades.

I agree with previous reviews that he genuinely wants everyone to succeed. ENES221 is no joke and taking the condensed version over the winter is tough, but at the same time McAvoy takes that into account and gives problems that are at reasonable difficulty for students who have to learn a chapter a day.

His explanations of the Friday technical lectures were fairly clear.  The only downside is that for an engineering professor, he's very tough on grammar.  ",768
sunderland,4,A,ENES100,"Dr. Sunderland is a really nice guy. Many of the other engineering teachers are nasty and arrogant in my opinion. Peter also takes the time to go over lecture material from Fridays during class and he is very encouraging. I sometimes find him annoying, though, when he constantly demands how your hovercraft is coming along. Overall, though, I would take Dr. Sunderland over many of the other teachers for ENES100!",768
sunderland,1,C,ENFP415,"The homework had nothing to do with the course.  There would usually be about four problems where you had to derive equations.  These problems had nothing to do with what was taught in class or the exams.  Peter enjoys math theory, but it doesn't have anything to do with our course.  The homework was impossible unless you sat in his office and basically had him walk you through it.  The only students that did well sat in his office for 2-3 hours and then the other members of the group would copy from each other.  There was complete separation between the book and what was taught in class.  Peter would give many equations during lectures that weren't in the book.  The book itself was terrible.  ",768
sunderland,2,B+,ENES100,"Sunderland's grading is pretty lax for the Milestone parts of your grade which is good, but his quizzes are not really fair for the content he had taught to the class. With the quizzes being 15% of your final grade and with the average on those quizzes to be about 60%, 60% of that 15 is already losing 6 percent of your grade assuming you score average. ",768
sunderland,2,B,ENES100,"I had him for ENES100 and I would say avoid him. He is a really nice guy and he does care about his students. However, if you are expecting the historical easy A from ENES 100, prepare to struggle. His quiz average was 60% and it was 15% of the final grade so you already are down a bit. And unless you have a very technical adept team (or a team that actually does their work on time without excessive reminders), you will struggle with accomplishing the milestones towards the end for the OSV. I have heard from other ENES 100 students in other classes that even though they were unable to achieve the final milestones, you still got credit for showing effort. But nope not with Sunderland. Take note of his ENES 100 grade distribution and it is almost a bell where 40% people get Bs. Anyway, choose your professor wisely. This class is a time sink as it is and with this professor it is not an easy A. ",768
sunderland,3,A-,ENES100,"Dr. Sunderland is a really nice professor and wants to see every person in ENES100 gain practical engineering skills. In my opinion, Dr. Sunderland is much better suited to teaching 300 level courses rather than a 100 level simply because of how high his expectations are. Except for his last quiz about Arduino programming, his quizzes are very easy to fail simply because the questions are 100x harder than any class material. He is not really forgiving with the milestone deadlines, so expect to get low grades on a ton of them unless your group is unusually good. Even with a great TA, taking ENES100 with Dr. Sunderland can be overly stressful.",768
sunderland,3,A,ENES100,"*Sigh* He is so so nice in lecture, but can be really difficult with his assignments. I am so grateful I had him during an online semester, because it seems he is way worse in person. When I took ENES100, all profs were TBA, so I was frustrated when I realized I had Sunderland. I can't really recommend him, but I also can't shit on him much. He does things a little differently from the other enes100 profs, so if possible, maybe take one that has better grade data. He was pretty good with the online thing. Very responsive to email. ",768
narayan,2,A,ENEE324,"Good lecturer. 

ENEE324 Fall 2018. The highest grade for the final was a 53 percent. The average was about a 26 percent. Need I say more? ",771
narayan,5,A+,ENEE324,"He is a good professor. He knows the material well. If you want to learn while getting a decent, then you should definitely take him.",771
narayan,4,B+,ENEE322,"Lectures are clear and easy to understand, but he spent too much time at the start of the semester on things that were obvious, so we ended up barely reaching Laplace transforms at the end, and we had to rush through Discrete Fourier Series/Transform and we didn't even do Z transform or the state space approach for LTIs. Also he had the TA post all HW assignments, and he would frequently say in class that the HW would be released on say Tuesday, but then the TA would release it Wednesday night. Since the HW gets turned in during discussion, he can't push the deadline back so we end up losing a day for HW due to bad prof/TA communication.

Those are the bad parts, but for exams, Narayan was quite fair. He would cut off the material that we'd be responsible for about 2 weeks before the exam, so there was never any worry about learning something in class and being tested on it in 2 days. He allows accumulating cheat sheets for exams (ie 1 sheet for exam 1, 2 for exam 2, ...). Important Fourier properties were given on the exam, like time/freq shifting so you weren't screwed if you forgot to put it on your sheet. However, he doesn't post old exams, so you can't treat it like a Papamarcou class where you just memorize the old exams.",771
narayan,5,A-,ENEE324,"ENEE324 with Professor Narayan was a wild ride. This was also during an online semester with open note tests. The difficulty for tests varied widely, from easy to hard to incredibly hard between our first midterm, second midterm, and final exam. However, his curve is very fair (I got rounded from a 77% to an A-. For reference, I performed a bit, but not considerably, better than the average overall). Professor Narayan has a very clear lecture style, though I would argue that it is slightly convoluted at times (some details are unnecessary to be constantly repeated, such as the fact that a probability must be positive, which is repeated every time a new equation is derived). I wish that the tests were restructured a bit, but I am overall just happy to get through this notoriously difficult class with an A-, and I greatly appreciate Narayan's ability to teach well and give difficult but instructive homework. I learned a lot, and that's all I can really ask for.",771
govindan,3,,ENEE244,"Friendly professor but extremely dry during lectures. Homeworks are occasionally long, but exams were always fair difficulty-wise. The course content is not too bad, so if you can teach yourself using the textbook, you will probably get an A.",773
govindan,4,,ENEE244,"Nice professor that was willing to accommodate students' needs when it came to due dates. Lecture content was usually focused on examples of the course material and real-world applications. The content itself is not too difficult to learn, but a knowledgeable TA can really enhance your experience and help reinforce ideas, since lecture doesn't focus much on past material. Exams were manageable and did not feature any foreign material, but one or two questions typically required some ""outside the box"" thinking for real-world application. Overall, good professor and fair course.",773
govindan,3,B,ENEE244,"One of the driest professors I've ever had. Lectures are really boring, and by the end of the semester I ended up watching his lectures asynchronously. In terms of workload, homework was due once a week, and if you give yourself enough time to do them, they're not too bad (though quite time consuming). Quizzes were relatively easy, and exams overall weren't too bad. He usually threw on one question worth 20% of the grade that would be an oddball, but you could usually get some credit for the question. If you have a good TA, you should be fine, but if not, you'll probably find yourself rewatching the recorded lectures and citing outside sources to learn the content.",773
govindan,4,A,ENEE244,"Professor Govindan is a nice guy. While his lectures are indeed kind of dry, he does accomodate students quite nicely and his quizzes, exams, and homeworks are very fair.

He is the first teacher I had for any ENEE class and he made me fall in love with the material.  He's a fantastic lecturer and keeps you engaged the whole time.  I never got bored.

His exams and homeworks are fair and he works straight out of the textbook which makes it easy to get ahead in class if you desire or to look over anything you didn't understand.  I personally never had to because he's a dope teacher.",774
barua,5,A,ENEE350,"Had Prof. Barua for both 244 and 350, and the experience was very much similar in both. The only difference for 350 was that he did not go over concrete examples of the concepts he explained in lecture, which he reserved largely for discussions.

Homework assignments were fair and straightforward, and exams generally were not terribly difficult, although select problems could get a bit tricky. Past exams are a must to get a look at the kind of questions he can ask.",774
barua,5,A+,ENEE244,"Dr. Barua was good at explaining the material. Make sure you make it to all lectures, they are very worth it. He does, however, not repeat anything under almost any circumstance. So make sure you're awake throughout lecture.

The grade consists of homework (15%) , two midterms (25% each), and the final (35%). Grading is dependent on your TA; we had an awesome, fair TA this semester. Good luck! Definitely one of the best professors for this class!",774
barua,3,B,ENEE244,"So Rajeev likes to come into lectures one minute late day after day.  You can expect the same routine from his class everyday, he spends the first few minutes reviewing what you did the previous class and then moves forward from there.  And he follows the order of the book, so if u miss something it is not difficult to find in the book.
As a lecturer, he is very good.  He explains everything thoroughly, and uses visual aids often. 

I thought he was the best teacher ever, until i went to his office hours a couple times.  He does not help at all! In lecture he explains things well, but if you cannot follow the way he explains it he just keeps explaining the EXACT same way until you say you understand.

Overall, good lecturer and in class teacher.  But not very helpful outside, and addiionally he can be very moody certain days and doesnt call on people for questions when he is ",774

barua,3,,ENEE350,"Rajeev Barua is a good lecturer but a bad professor. 

Pros:
=>easy grader (depends on TA since I don't think he graded any of the papers)
=>Good lectures (need to go to every class since the assigned book doesn't really help in studying, and 90% of what he asked in the exam were from his lectures).
=>average of the class was around 80% in all the exams ( idk how though, I personally didn't too great)

Cons:
=>not punctual (always 5 mins late to the class)
=>really bad and small handwriting (had to sit in the front of the class to make sure I don't miss anything he writes since he doesn't post his notes on elms ).
=>straight up disses the students if they get the answer wrong during the lecture.
=>gave only 2 or 3 days to finish homework. Most of the time, he assigns the homework a week before but tells you the martial in it is not covered, and there is no way to finish the homework early. Also, he gave the last homework, which was due on the day of the final exam.

format of the class: 7 homework (2 coding and 5 problem solving), 2 midterms (covered the lecture notes), 1 final (cumulative)

overall this class wasn't bad, but it definitely felt hectic because of the lack of understanding this professor had for his students.


",774
barua,2,A-,ENEE350,"Dr. Barua is an extremely uncaring and unmotivated professor who comes off as unprofessional. I don't know if it's because of the switch to a completely online format, but he does not respond to emails, posts lectures and assignments only a few days before they're due, and is either eating or yawning or both in all of his lecture videos.",774

On day 1 we thought he had a stick up his ass for harping on people being late but he completely won us over by week 4. Talking to another student in his 605 class, he's even harder on grad students. Highly recommend taking this class (or any class) with him, you'll learn a lot. Bare in mind, if you are a Computer Engineer just looking to get your undergraduate lab credit, stay away. Attendance counts for him so don't skip if you can possibly manage it. Can't overstate this though, it's a lot of work.",777
la_richard,4,B,ENEE322H,"Dr. La is a pretty good professor. He teaches pretty well and sets a pretty large curve for the class, which he usually ends up lowering. The curve started at an 80% for an A, which was then lowered to a 75%. 

His tests can be hard, but from what I've heard of other 322 classes, all of the tests are hard. He tells you that he will only assign homework every other week with around 4 problems on them, but he has consistently been giving us homework every week with 6-8 problems on it, which are very time consuming. Also, for the first two midterms he gave us homeworks which covered material that was going to be on the test and set the due date to after the midterm, which meant we didn't have the solutions to study from. 

Overall I'd say Dr. La is a good backup to Papamarcou if you can't get him.",779
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"Professor Bonenberger is an amazing professor for engineering statics, both ENES 102 and ENES 220. He writes everything you need to know on the chalkboard and goes over multiple examples for each topic. He is very helpful during the groupwork problems and isn't a harsh grader, often giving lots of partial credit. If you go to class everyday and take notes, you will do great in this class. His lectures aren't boring at all and the exams are very fair. Overall, he is one of my favorite professors here at UMD, I highly recommend you take him.",783
bonenberger,1,,ENES102,Terrible teacher. Writes bad notes on the chalkboard. Doesn't do practice problems that even relate to the homework or tests. Tried emailing for help and it took the entire semester for him to respond. Highly discourage taking him if it's your first semester in college,783

From the beginning of enes102, I had no idea what a free body diagram was and was awful at basic physics. Bonenberger did such an amazing job illustrating material to the class. He uses real-world examples to apply the material he teaches in class. Bonenberger uses a step by step approach to teach class. Does a lot of example problems and numbers each step! Great guy overall. However, his grade distribution is not as good as other professors. ",783
bonenberger,3,,ENES102,"Very nice guy, explains stuff well. However, the exams were NOTHING like the homeworks and examples. The best way I can explain it is, the homework and quizzes were like riding a bicycle on a flat road (easy, straightforward). However, the exams were like mountain biking down Mt. Everest (vaguely relating to biking on a road, but about 10 times tougher.",783
bonenberger,4,C,ENES102,"Good teacher, but the class was just really tough for me.  My TA graded the homework problems surprisingly tough.  I often got points taken off even though, I had the answers to the homework online.
Tests were not really hard, but there was always one problem on every test that was just extremely hard.  Most people would mess up on that problem and end up having the highest possible test grade a B or C.",783
bonenberger,5,B,ENES102,"Great professor, explained things very thoroughly and made sure that his students got the information they needed for exams/quizzes.",783
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"Fantastic professor. His notes are extremely neat and detailed which are very helpful for doing the homework and organizing formula sheets for the exams. He is happy to clarify any questions students have during class, and helpful during office hours.",783
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"I also took ENES102 with him (received a B). That said, Dr. Bonenberger is an absolutely phenomenal teacher, even if he's a bit of an engineering stereotype -- extremely methodical.

bonenberger,3,B,ENES220,"There is no doubt that dr bonnenberger is a good teacher and if you go to class regularly you will get everything you need to know through the notes. That being said he can be really boring to have to listen to and moves at such a fast and robot like pace that most of the information is not understood. Also he is a bit awkward and hard to approach outside of class and otherwise. I prefer beigel or fourney they convey the same amount of information yet teach class in a manner that is more conversational and more involved for the students rather than writing all of the notes on the board and not giving you enough time to copy. Also besides Chang he is probably the harshest grader. On many occasions I would lose large amounts of points for simple calculation error which essentially caused me to get aetter below what I expected. If you can get a different professor, not Chang, take them instead, but if you're stick with him then it's not the end of the world ",783

Theres no way to take bad notes in his class he writes everything out on the board and explains everything hes doing very well. If u have any questions go to his office hours or ask after class cause hes not great with responding to email.   Very fair with extra credit as well.  One of the best teachers ive had at UMD by far. Do the work and study for tests and you should be fine.",783
bonenberger,5,B+,ENES102,"Bonenberger moves incredibly quickly, but is easy to understand, as long as you pay attention and take good notes. In one class period, you can expect to learn a lot of information. Not much of a personality; I think he's made an attempt at humor twice this semester. Overall, I would definitely recommend him, great professor. ",783
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"Not particularly exciting, but he explains the material well. Also his in class test reviews consist of telling you what to write on your formula sheet. (which is about half the battle in ENES classes)",783
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"Dr. Bonenberger is one of the best professors I've had so far. He co-wrote the textbook, so he definitely knows what he's talking about when it comes to Mechanics of Materials. However, he's also able to effectively communicate his knowledge to his students. He teaches in a very organized, linear, and methodical manner and explains every step and concept as he writes it on the board. 

Unlike some other mechanics professors, who show up to class late and delude their students into thinking they actually learn something in 20 minutes, Bonenberger teaches you for the full 50 minutes so that his students know the right way to solve mechanics problems, not just shortcuts you can throw away as soon as you leave ENES220. 

The only downside is that he actually grades how well your beam does in the competition, and he nitpicks on the design report, so make sure you check your calculations and design your beam right! 

Overall, if you like an all-business professor who does not waste your time and teaches you all that you need to know, then this is the guy for you.",783
bonenberger,5,A,ENES220,"This guy is all business.  He's a great teacher and does every example problem step by step.  If you happen to come across the solutions to the homework you can tell they're done by him by how neat and organized they are.  If you pay attention and write everything down that he does there's almost no way you don't get an A.  He actually has given out extra credit.  In my class he gave everyone in the class a bunch of extra credit just for everyone completing the professor reviews at the end of the semester.

On the one time he cracks a joke during the semester he will immediately apologize.  He doesn't like nonsense and has almost no personality.  One last thing, if you're one of those people that likes Beigel, be warned, he hates the guy.  So when the exam review comes around he takes a lot cheap shots.

All in all, if you want to learn the material and don't need excitement in your class, pick him.",783
bonenberger,5,A+,ENES220,"Good teacher. Teaches everything step by step, which is really easy to follow. The 2 hour discussion period consisted of finishing that weeks material followed by doing 2-3 group problems. He was also very helpful with the problems.

Homework solutions are ""around"". Look for them.

To do well on the exams, just study the practice problems he posts up. If you can do all of them and understand those problems, you will DEFINITELY get an A or B because the exam problems are just variations of the practice problems.

The bad: He doesnt joke about anything, or talk about anything besides the class, and hes got some OCD so hes really picky on homework and tests.

The ugly: Besides his gigantic glasses, he will never curve anything, gives no extra credit and takes an more delight than ive ever seen in seeing students not do well or fail tests/quizzes.

He gives practice problems from past exams with answers (but not solutions). They are very close to what will be on the exam, so do them! The ENES professors also always hold review sessions before exams and will go over all of the practice problems. Some of the exam problems required a bit of thinking, but weren't impossible. Some exams were definitely easier than others.

Briber himself is great, he's really passionate about his work and you can tell. He brings in lots of hands on materials, so we can experience things for ourselves.

If you can sit through the dull lectures and take notes, you should definitely take this class. Not that I'm going to remember anything after the final, but he's a great guy, really personable and approachable outside class.",784
briber,5,A+,ENMA150,"Briber is super boring in lecture. However you kind of need to go in order to get the information needed to pass the exams. there are two exams each worth 15% and 3 labs each worth 15%. there is a final paper worth 15% and hw is 10%. Basically, the labs are REALLY easy but time consuming. the HW is incredibly easy as well and the final paper is a restatement of wikipedia. 

the TAs grade really leniently too and give you partial credit for almost anything. you can essentially get C's on both exams and still have an A if you hand in your work on time

he usually includes a bonus on the exams too. and sometimes in the homeworks.

Its not uncommon to get over 100% in the class. If you can't get an A you actually have to TRY: meaning you don't attend a single lecture and turn in your stuff late if not at all. 

this class is almost all memorization for the exams and there are only three math concepts you need to know. which by the way are simple algebra (plug in the variables)

the exams are all written so you do need to know the material. but honestly a middle schooler could ace this class not to mention a university student. its a great class to take if you need a CORE non lab science.

ankem,4,,ENMA464,"Ankem is slightly difficult to understand, but his lecture slides are very clear. He has a sense of humor and is a decent teacher. He will post slides before exams to help you study. The exams are straightforward, so if you study the notes you should be fine. There are pop quizes, 2 exams, 1 paper and a presentation. Overall, ENMA464 is a pretty easy class as long as you attend class.",801
wooldridge,5,A+,ENCE325,Amazing professor. He knows his stuff and tries to make this incredibly long lecture interesting and fun. He usually tries to make the lecture as short as possible because he knows no one wants to sit in the class for 2.5 hours straight. Easy going and very nice. Tests were straightforward and he tells you what to expect. Weekly quizzes and then group project assignments towards the middle of the semester. Nothing too difficult. Highly recommend this professor!,804
wooldridge,5,A+,ENCE325,Amazing class its an easy elective for civil and hes a department head so he isnt very strict on grading. We are online due to covid and the class is very easy. Id highly recommend for a quick elective. ,804
tretter,4,B,ENEE322,"I do not think people give Prof. Tretter enough credit. Sure, he may be older and somewhat monotone, but he knows his stuff and wants his students to do well. Be warned though, the grading can be pretty harsh sometimes, just know your stuff and practice the homework over and over. Tests usually consist of HW or variations thereof. They are usually pretty fair. Make sure to go to class too (he covers stuff that you wouldn't know otherwise)...He also let's you skip the final if you are alright with your grade in the class!",805
tretter,1,D,ENEE322,This is the unfortunate case of an individual who was clearly not loved enough as a child thus restricting him from loving anyone else or for that matter feeling any sort of emotion period. This man is a robot covered in artificial skin. He speaks acts and lectures in the same monotone voice and never shows any interest in the material. He is definitely the worst professor I've had throughout my college career and have lost respect for the entire ece department for keeping this broken down machine. If you didn't get the hint do not take this professor no matter what. Wait a semester and take the class when a different professor teaches. ,805
tretter,3,C,ENEE322,"INCREDIBLY boring! I really didn't enjoy this class, and his teaching didn't help. He often went on tangents that were only vaguely related to course material. Homework was collected often, sometimes every class, and it was graded. His tests were pretty hard, too. You definitely need to go to class, and the homework helps. ",805
beigel,3,B,ENES220,"Up until the week before thanksgiving, I would have given Beigel 5 stars. When he teaches, he is excellent. He explains things clearly, and even manages to make it entertaining. He engages the class, and makes sure you are not afraid of asking a question, no mean feat for a class of 40+. However, by thanksgiving, his teaching took a turn for the worst. Never have I had a teacher who is more lazy. By the end, he started class 20 minutes late because he was sitting outside the room, too lazy to come in. He can be rude too. He once ripped someones homework in half to entertain the class. One girl asked for him to do a problem for final exam review. He said he didn't feel like it a proceeded to tell a joke. He seems to care more about coming off as smart, funny, aloof, and all knowing. Instead, he can be off-putting, lazy, and inconsiderate.",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"Unequivocally the best prof I've had at UMD.

I don't even know how, though. He goofs off for the first 10+ minutes of class, and pretty much everything everyone else said, but when he gets to teaching...

He says more with less time and words than any other prof, but you can still understand it; he's not just fire-hosing you with information.

I'm choosing a senior elective based about 50% on the fact that Beigel is teaching it.... TAKE BEIGEL.

Caveat: He's not for everyone. A friend of mine really didn't like him because he does more physical, visible explanations rather than derivations and proofs. I hate derivations so this was perfect, but not for my friend.",808
beigel,4,B,ENES220,"Overall, Beigel is a friendly and approachable teacher.  However, I do not like his teaching style and I think he is somewhat lazy for a teacher.  He basically writes down stuff on the board and you just copy what he writes down.  He doesn't really explain material as he writes it down.",808
beigel,4,B+,ENES102,"Beigel is a very good teacher. He doesn't beat around the bush and is very effective in teaching his students the best way to complete each problem. If you pay attention and make an effort to understand all the homeworks, you should be fine to pass the class. He is very approachable during office hours too, but sometimes instead of explaining a problem to you, he will just do it for you. If you ask, though, he won't have a problem explaining what he did.

Also if you are like me, you have difficulty trying to pay attention for a whole class period. He doesn't necessarily start teaching right away and will keep you engaged with stories which are always pretty interesting. His classes go by pretty fast so you're not sitting there watching the clock the whole time.

Definitely take Beigel.",808
beigel,4,B,ENES220,"he is a good person. I like him as a person. As a teacher, it goes back and forth. He doesn't really teach as much as he just shows examples- and sometimes he lies when doing the problems just to see if someone will call him out on it. So... now I'm lost in the class. Just take him if you're a genius who wants a chill environment- if you really want to learn things- take another teacher, but go to Tom's office hours or review sessions. ",808
beigel,3,B+,ENES102,"He's a really nice guy in general, and a pretty good teacher. The homework load was alright, especially if you did the problems throughout the week. If you waited until the last minute, it would suck, but you could still get them done. 

The reason I won't give him 5 stars is because he was extremely inappropriate at time, especially towards females. He makes dirty jokes that were usually funny, but a lot of the time were downright offensive. One girl I know stopped going to his office hours and was afraid to ask him for help because of the things he said to her. 

Gives good examples, and is helpful, but sometimes his jokes go way too far.",808
beigel,4,A,ENES220,"Pretty easy class, didn't need to study too hard for the exams and the homeworks are not too bad if you work with other students. Beigel is a funny guy and a decent teacher. He wastes a TON of time at the beginnings of classes, so you can show up 10 minutes late and usually miss nothing. He allows a lot of freedom with the project, which is nice compared to what others have had to do (ie Bonenberger's classes). I can see how some students may have trouble since he does not really teach concepts, but in reality these students are probably not cut out to be engineers.",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"One of the best professors in the engineering department. People complain that he only does one or two examples a day, but the examples he does are exactly what you need to know he explains the examples thoroughly, showing each step. He does bs for most of this class but he can afford to because he's not teaching you the stuff you don't need to know. Pay attention in class and study his examples before the test, you'll be fine. If you want a teacher who goes the full time doing pointless examples and proofs just because it makes you feel like you're learning something, don't take him. Oh, he's also one of the nicest and funniest people out there.",808
beigel,2,B,ENES102,"I'm obviously a minority here, but I was not a big fan of Beigel. He teaches by example, and not by concepts, which really screwed me over when I got to the final - a couple of the problems I had never seen before, and thus had no idea how to do them. 
The homework and the in-class problems (he has us do some in discussion in groups) were easy, as all you needed to do was copy from the solutions manual. 
However, office hours were nice, even though they are always crowded. You can ask him questions one-on-one.
Finally, his personality. Most people love it, I couldn't stand it. He would talk for 30 minutes into class, and then do one example problem. I would much rather spend that time sleeping since it was a 9am class, or let us out early. And I felt as though you couldn't come late or you might miss something, because the time he talked was irregular.

tl;dr: Teaches by example, copy the homework, go to office hours, deal with him wasting your time.
",808
beigel,4,A,ENES102,"Tom is a good statics teacher. The concepts in statics are pretty easy: sum of all forces and moments equal 0, with a  little bit of material properties included. Tom teaches with 1-2 examples per class. This is fine for people who learn through example, but I found I would not fully understand what was being taught. The homework problems ended up being a pain. I ended up in office hours every week to do them because I may miss a concept tom showed during lecture. 
Tests (which are generally the same among all statics teachers) can be tricky because there can be problems you have never seen before, but can surely apply the big concepts to solving the problems. He gives out a lot of practice problems to prepare you for exams, so take advantage of those.",808
beigel,3,B-,ENES102,"Wow after that final, I'm glad I even passed. I'll be honest, I think I learned more by doing the homework with the solution manual (obviously written out by Bonenberger), than going to Tom's lectures. We did on average one example a class, which definitely was not getting the material into my head. Others might have been at an advantage if they had physics or calc 3. Its a tough class, but enjoyable with Tom. You could always turn in stuff late, and he is so willing to help. I love him as a person, just not as a teacher. Get on his good side, and make an effort to show you're trying at least! He's not for everyone.",808
beigel,5,A-,ENES220,"Great professor - definitely worth taking his class if you get the chance.

The other reviews are pretty spot on. ",808
beigel,4,B,ENES220,"Ehhhh..I'm going to be honest in that I really don't see what the big deal is with this guy. He blazes through the material with one or two examples per topic which for boneheads like me simply is not enough to get the 'A' that everyone wants, nor is it enough to learn the material sufficiently well. I did laugh my ass off all semester though, and he is highly amusing, but looking back I would have rather had someone more rigorous because I feel like I would have definetly gotten my moneys worth having not had Tom. 

Pros:
- You can turn your all of your crap in pretty much as late as you want if you just tell a dead baby joke or make a general remark regarding the end of the human race as we know it (highly inevitable). 

- Is definetly sympathetic towards his students, and realizes that this university pretty much sucks ass in all aspects of teaching engineering (he went here too).

- Makes classtime very quick and concise (could also be a bad thing for people like me)

Cons:
- Rushes through material with one or two examples and not a very thorough or memerable approach (I've already forgotten a good amount since class has let out and its only been a few weeks.)

- Is late, and is a HUGE slacker which for someone like me was annoying (again...didn't feel like I got my $ or time's worth)

Overall I'd say go for it. Engineering is awful here anyways, so its not like you are going to find another teacher with an actual sense of humor like him. If you are smarter than I am (I'm an idiot and I got a B) and can extrapolate a lot out of a few simple problems, then this class will be a very easy and enjoyable experience with him. If you need to be smacked in the head with a hammer to learn the material then I would definetly go with someone else who is going to have a much more thorough and in depth approach to this class.  


His class notes were only slightly helpful most of the time in attempting homework problems, and I found them to be very jumpy and illogical.  ",808
beigel,5,,ENES102,"VERY smart, funny, nice guy. Not once did he ever get angry at a student for asking a question or for clarification, no matter how stupid the question. He is very approachable and helpful, and really knows what you need to know and what you dont - he's been doing this for almost 20 years. However, the final exam was brutal, even though the midterms were easy, so be warned. I definitely recommend Beigel for ENES102.",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"Tom is easily the best professor I've ever had.  He's a great guy, hilarious, very reasonable, strives to help his students however he can, and he's legitimately a good teacher.  While most professors earn their teaching position simply by knowing the material (some don't even meet this qualification), Tom actually knows how to teach it as well, a skill that seems to be in strikingly short supply amongst UMD professors.",808
beigel,5,A+,ENES220,"The best engineering professor I have had at this university by far. I agree with all the other comments posted about him thus far:
1. Comes to late pretty much every class
2. Teaches you more in 25 minutes than you would learn in any other 50 minute class
3. Tells semi-offensive jokes that you either find hilarious or slightly alarming.
4. Cancels class whenever he isn't up for teaching that day
5. Explains the material extremely well. 
6. He is extremely interested in answering any questions you have.

I strongly recommend him for ENES102/220.",808
beigel,5,,ENES220,Tom is the man.  Definitely take him for 102/220 if you can.  Who knew you could learn material and have a good time in class?  Blows my mind...,808
beigel,4,A,ENES220,"For some reason, he teaches a lot less than the other professors yet the students learn a lot more.  Sometimes, the hour-long lecture is taught in as little as 20 minutes.  Having him as a teacher drastically increases your chances of doing well on the midterms and finals.  But he tells a lot of offensive jokes so if you're the sensitive type, avoid him.",808
beigel,5,,ENES102,"Beigel is the best instructor i've had.  He only teaches about 25 minutes out of a normal class, but i guarantee you will learn more in those 25 minutes than you do in any other 50 minutes class.  Also, the beginning of statics covers a lot of material from the beginning of physics and calc 3 and i learned my stuff for all 3 classes in beigels lectures.  He also tells you exactly whats on tests and is the funniest teacher youll have.  He sometimes will give you the option of leaving or staying and listening to his stories.  Stay for the stories.  ",808
beigel,4,B,ENES220,"Either you like him or you hate him.  hes a no BS kind of guy for problems, but a complete BS guy when it comes to doing work.  he will occasionally cancel class within the first 5 minutes because he doesnt feel like teaching that day.  this is great if you have other shit to do, but not so good if you want to learn and just walked all the way across campus to his class.  He is willing to help out if you make an appointment to see him but dont count on him being in his office hours.  his sense of humor is such that if u ask a question he will call you retarded but is clearly kidding and will proceed to answer. He doesnt teach from the book though so just write down the equations he give in class. they make things easier anyway.  ",808
beigel,3,B,ENES220,Beigel is only for certain types of students.  If you have trouble with Physics and ENES then he is definetly not for you.  He doesn't really teach but if you are the type that can learn off one or two examples off the board and dont need every thing explained to you this is for you.  He does however teach you only what you need to know and does not overload you with information.  And somehow the class always seems to know exactly what problems will be on the exams.  ,808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"Had him for ENES 102, ENES 220, and ENME 400...Great teacher.  Strips the confusing bs down to what you really need to know.  I'll warn you, he is pretty vulgar at times and is almost always late to class.  If you don't care about that stuff, take him, he is a great teacher.  If you follow what he does in class and review what he tells you will be on the tests and finals, you will get an A.",808
beigel,4,,ENES102,"His class is definatley an experince.  I'd recomend if you can get him.  He'll always be late and won't always teach, which is a lot better than it sounds.  He'll help you all you need at office hours and is a very understanding guy.  Very freindly and funny. Highly recomend.",808
beigel,4,,ENES102,"tom is probably on of the most hilarious teachers ive ever had. he will come in late every day, and will tell some of the dirtiest, yet hilarious stories. sometimes he can be lazy when teaching the stuff, but he does explain it pretty well, and he'll help you if you really need it",808
beigel,5,,ENES102,"Beigel is awesome. He will take a problem,  tell you how to do it the long way, then show you the easiest way to do it.

He is a genius. Most of us are not. So if you ask him a question he will try to lead you through it, but if you're too slow to understand he will move on and you will have to go to his office hours or ask him after class. Easier to just ask kids around you.

Here's one thing you really don't know: Beigel is Chuck Norris in disguise. It could be a good thing, or a bad thing. Either way, it's awesome.

Just take his class.",808
beigel,5,,ENES102,"Beigel is by far one of the most unusual instructors I have encountered. He generally shows up late to class, tells lots of jokes and stories and can be quite profane. If you don't mind listening to his dirty jokes and frequent swearing, he actually does a pretty good job teaching. He does lots of examples that are likely to show up on exams and does a good job answering any questions if people don't understand.  ",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"A great teacher. I never went to class unless there some concept I didn't understand in the homework. Beigel would then go over that type of thoroughly so it would be pretty difficult to not understand. His reviews for the tests also go over everything you would need to know. 

Overall Mechanics is not a hard course. You could easily just not go to class and teach it to yourself. But, if you to class you have to do very little work outside of it. ",808
beigel,5,,ENES220,"Beigel teaches the students how to finish the problems they have to complete for the homework and exams in order to pass the course.  He teaches with the minimal amount of academic BS that you will encounter from every other professor.  It's almost like he has worked in the real world as an actual practicing engineer!

The lectures are straightforward and to the point:
1. Here is a concept
2. Here is a problem involving this concept
3. Here is how you solve the problem
4. next concept

On the first day Beigel is very up front about his teaching style and encourages students to switch to a different section if they don't like it.  If you want a professor that reads the book to you verbatim, then don't take Beigel's class.",808
beigel,2,A,ENES220,"If you like being taught the easy and stripped down version, this is the teacher for you. I personally found him unprofessional. He consistently treated the class like his social hour and would start 20 min late and then keep us late because he didn't get through all of the material. 

If you want to get on his good side, bring him food/mountain dew. ",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"This is the professor you want for mechanics of materials.

Tells you what you need to know for the test, how to think through problems, and how to apply that knowledge to real-world situations.  He's also hilarious.

Work is identical to statics- 1 hw/week, 3 tests or so, and a sweet project.

Take Beigel, he's the man.",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,"Beigel was an excellent professor who knows how to explain concepts better than most other professors. He has taught the course so many times at this point that he knows exactly what he's doing. He is consistently ahead of all other professors and therefore can take the time to tell you some of his best jokes or engineering facts. 

As long as you attend lectures (most of them at least), understand homework problems, attend his review session before exams (extremely helpful), and most of all take the time to make an equation sheet, there is absolutely no way you won't get an A in this class",808
beigel,4,B,ENES220,"This review is strictly based off of his online class as that is what people will be dealing with for the next semester or so. He was amazing in person, but lacks a little on the online transition. It was difficult to reach him, his lectures were released at 1am at night, and the first exam was difficult. That being said, he understood this and gave curves generously based on the struggle given to students. Extra credit opportunities were given and he consistently changed homework due dates based on the convenience of the class. His TA was great and usually the one people would contact. This was a summer class and was extremely accelerated so I imagine during the semester it will be easier.",808
beigel,5,A,ENES220,Its covid time so that means its online but the way he runs the class is so easy to follow and keep up with the work. I love his short and concise videos for instruction and the homework isnt bad. the review sessions before exams are a lifesaver and Beigel is a really enjoyable person. Even with that rockstar addiction he has. ,808
horiuchi,4,A,ENEE303,"Horiuchi is a fairly good professor for 303.  He goes into a lot of detail about device physics, which didn't interest me too much personally, but it does make the derivations of the equations a bit easier to follow.  We spent a lot of time discussing different designs that can be made with transistors, which was nice, but it felt like the second half of the semester was just a million ways to use the MOSFET, with little actual ""new"" content.
Regarding the work, homeworks were fairly straightforward, if sometimes long.  They come about once a week, and cover mostly whatever you do in discussion that week.  Also, GO TO DISCUSSION.  This is where you will get most practice with application of concepts.
On exams, the midterm and final were weighted equally and designed with the same expected time and difficulty.  You get one cheat sheet, and there are no numbers, which is a godsend for people like myself who tend to think 9 + 2 = 13, or other similar math errors.
Overall, a good professor to take this course with.",809
horiuchi,4,A,ENEE313,"The class as a whole wasn't bad, even though device physics isn't really my area of interest. Homework assignments were usually pretty tough, but could be figured out by closely reviewing the textbook or lectures notes. The exams were also tough, but he lets you bring a double-sided sheet of notes, which is more useful as a study tool than for actually relying on during the test. In fact, he tends to give you most, if not all, of the equations that you will need, you just need to figure out how to apply them. His grading scale is laid out in the syllabus, but he will curve individual exams if the class average is really low. Overall, I'd recommend Dr. Horiuchi.",809
horiuchi,3,B,ENEE303,"Lectures were fairly straightforward, assignments were a bit difficult but not unmanageable, and there were only 2 exams, including the final which was designed to be the length of a normal exam.

When we had discussions in class, that was more interesting. She's just interested in everyone's opinion. Her lecture outlines are posted online, but she usually fleshes them out in lecture, so its helpful to go. Don't bother buying the textbook, I never opened it. She doesn't test on anything from the book, only lecture.

dunham,1,,EDSP376,Do not take this class if you do not have to and do not trust the data for this professor. The class is extremely unorganized and moves at a way too fast pace. The professor is horrible about responding to emails and is always MIA. If you want to take a class where you get the review packets the night before a test and can never get in contact with the professor then this is the class for you. ,897
dunham,5,A,EDSP376,"I took EDSP376 online over the winter. The main content of the course is taught through recorded lectures, and there are biweekly synchronous lectures with some basic participation activities. We didn't have any exams but there were a few untimed quizzes and homework assignments, as well as an easy final project.

It's intended to be a ""full immersion"" class so there's no speaking in class or in the recorded lectures. That's not really a problem though, since he's patient and writes what he's signing in the zoom chat, and the videos have pictures to describe whatever he's talking about. It's rarely, if ever, unclear. There was only about an hour or two of recorded lectures a week (not bad for a 3-week class) so it's pretty easy to rewatch them before/during a quiz.

Overall, it's an easy class if you put in literally any effort at all and you'll probably have a bit of fun with it too. He was good about responding to emails (despite what the other reviewer says) and other concerns. Easy five stars.",897
dunham,5,,EDSP376,"I took this class during Fall 2020 when it was online due to covid. Michael was always very friendly and considerate of different signing paces and receptive to any feedback.

The course material was taught via short pre-recorded lecture videos. These videos are completely in ASL and don't have captions or voiceovers, but most of the time his facial expressions and pictures/animations make the meanings pretty clear. You do have to be pro-active if there's anything you don't understand, and that means either emailing him separately or asking a question during the live class. But, he encourages people to interrupt and ask what signs are, so it's totally okay if you don't understand the video lectures entirely.

There were live classes for 1-hour once a week. On Testudo, it shows up as two sessions a week, but before the semester starts, he lets you pick one of three times that meet once a week in smaller groups (not sure if this was just because of the online format or not). These live classes were fully immersive, so everyone was muted and any questions would be asked via chat. He would prepare some sort of activity that involved using signs taught in the previous week's lecture videos in order to practice them and gauge comprehension. There was never too much pressure to know every sign beforehand, because, as I mentioned, it was completely okay to be reminded of the signs or even learn new signs by just asking.

Overall, Michael really cares about helping students learn the material, and this is a great class to take with him if you're interested in learning some basic ASL directly from someone in the deaf community.",897

swanlek,5,A+,COMM107,This prof is the COOLEST you could ever have. He is super young and cool.

The class is not hard and he does an amazing job at trying to make this class as easy as possible while also making sure you are learning the material. Especially with virtual learning, this man has been awesome at creating a stress-free experience. I felt super comfortable in this class and also feel like I learned a lot about public speaking.

If you decide to take COMM107, go with Swanlek.",946

First off, he knows what he's doing and does so well with helping out students to any capacity that they need. Even with the virtual format and lack of engagement from students, he made class so fun and interesting. He's always cracking jokes and being himself which makes learning and staying engaged so much easier. He's seriously the coolest guy ever and made class so fun. He's so understanding with students, especially considering the virtual format and all that. He's also not a harsh grader. He's so passionate about what he does and it really comes off on screen. If you have the choice, pick Swanlek for comm107, you definitely won't regret it. The nicest coolest most understanding person ever. ",946
mcewen,1,A,,"I was actually really excited to take this course because I am interested in the history and art of the ancient Mesoamerican people, but her lecturing capabilities (or more precisely, lack of) completely ruined the course for me. 

On the first day of class I encountered what has now become her infamous ""um"". She literally throws that in every other word. She also has an unfortunate habit of not being concrete. She uses terms like ""kind of"" and ""sort of"" and ""possibly"" instead of saying that it is. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate way to explain things in an art history course, but I found it irritating. This was also said every other word. I found that she tried to stretch themes and concepts so it fit the lecture, and sometimes I really couldn't believe the information she was giving.

The course itself was rather monotonous because it was just simply going over object after object. This class, however, was not hard by any means. The TAs' provided effective summaries of the themes presented in class, the quizzes in discussion and the exams in lecture were straight forward. If you want to get rid of your CORE, I would only recommend this class because it was easy, but do not take it with this particular professor.",947
mcewen,2,A,ARTH250,"Prof. McEwan seems fair and nice enough, but I found her lectures very scatterbrained and hard to follow. I didn't know whether to write down everything she said or nothing at all. She says ""um"" far too often for a college professor to the point where it is distracting. The class itself covers interesting material, but she manages to make it tedious and boring in lecture. Go to discussion and get the books (they're cheap) because the TAs were very helpful, and I learned way more in discussion than in lecture. Not a hard class if you can pick up the important themes in the art quickly and are good at memorizing pictures.",947
mcewen,1,A-,ARTH260,"I was excited to take this class because of the course content - the class itself was reviewing art in and about revolution/social issues, and it seemed like an interesting topic to learn more about during the pandemic. 
Unfortunately, this class was loads and loads of busy work - two synchronous lectures a week, a paper and discussion post every week, extra assignments and polls every week, and a group project for the final (note: collaborating on a group project is already tough enough - trying to maintain everyone online during a PANDEMIC is even tougher). There is almost no leeway in these assignments either. Here are some more pressing gripes with the class:
-Don't buy the 40 dollar textbook. It is dry and is barely needed for class. It isn't even included in readings until the 8th week.
-You won't learn anything from McEwen if you try. She is monotonous, dry, and her lectures don't have a clear outline. There is almost no talk of actual historical contexts behind the art discussed, and if there is - again, it is muddled by her dry and emotionless delivery. 
-The group project now, as mentioned before, is actually painful.
-You'll never have a break from assignments in this class. They're all busywork, and you won't learn anything from them. 
-On top of all the busywork, participation in the zoom classes is graded too, and your grade will tank if you don't speak up in a 78 person class (...most people do not.)

I will say that it is a bit ironic that this class has been so burdensome and unbending given the title and content of the course - this was the only class that was unwilling to cancel or change topics during election week. 

I will say the TAs are lovely and come prepared for discussions with good and informative content. 

Overall, if you're looking to takeaway any knowledge of art and social justice with this class, just go to Wikipedia and save your time and $$$. 
",947
mcewen,4,A,ARTH260C,"This class is really easy to get an A in but a lot of busy work. At least for this semester, there were no quizzes or anything really that tests your knowledge on the content. There are discussion posts and weekly response papers (300 words). The sections decide prompts for the final which are two essays. There is also a group project but she’s a pretty easy grader on it. There is a textbook but you most definitely don’t need to read it unless it’s for finding examples for the final. ",947

hanafy,3,,ARAB104,"Good professor, very helpful when asked questions and pushed you to participate in class.

washington_mary,4,B+,ENGL234,"Professor Washington is a great professor! but absolutely DO NOT take this class if you dont want to read.

Definitely recommend this class ",952
washington_mary,4,B+,AASP298L,"So, let me start off with the positive. The professor is very passionate about what she is teaching and I can honestly say that the material and readings were interesting. However, this is not an easy A. I got a B+ in the class. Granted, I didn't read half of the books, but even when I did read, the quizzes were very difficult. Also, the final is cumulative and it's like impossible to remember everything that happened in every story that we read over the course of the semester. And yes, this is a literature class, so there was a lot of assigned reading. But to end on a good note, the stories that I did read, I highly enjoyed. ",952
washington_mary,4,B,AASP298L,"I got an A- in this class, and it was not easy. MaryHelen reviews books online, her material is hard. the final is almost impossible, quizzes annoying. Papers do able. Try to get anna steed as your TA, she is the best ive come to realize that at the end. ",952

washington_mary,1,C,ENGL234,Absolutely the worst class I've ever taken in my life. It is so unorganized and the material taught is normally random or far-fetched. Washington acts surprised by her own powerpoints and just rants for 45 minutes about god knows what. It is impossible to tell what is important and what's not. Please don't listen to the positive reviews on here as these were probably reviews by her own TA's. The grading is terrible as well and the quizzes are composed of multiple choice questions with about 10 different choices making them extremely hard. The reading is often boring and uninteresting. And if Morillo is your TA don't expect to know your grade on an assignment til about a month after its collected. And certainly do not expect to get a good grade.,952
washington_mary,4,,ENGL234,"I have to say I really enjoyed Professor Washington's class. It was very intersting and she was very knowledgable and passionate about her class and managed to make me so too. The books we had to read were short and interesting and for the most part are the only 'homework' you get apart from the 3 papers mentioned below. She is funny and makes the class interact with her along the lectures and is always open to new ideas. She is very nice and sometimes is even lenient on postponing quizzes. There are MANY quizzes in lecture and discussion which require the stories to be read. I would recommend this class to anyone. It isn't loaded with work and you learn a lot of interesting things. I personally am very happy I took the class.
There are 3 papers and a final apart from the quizzes. The last 2 papers are a little difficult but you get plenty of time and plenty of help! To succeed in this class just go to lecture and listen. Hope this helps! ",952
washington_mary,5,A,ENGL234,"I don't know what experience the other reviewer had on here - Professor Washington is one of the all time best teachers I've ever encountered, and most of the people in my ENGL234 class agree. She really knows her stuff, and she's clearly passionate about what she's teaching. Lectures are interesting, and often times don't just focus on the readings; the class isn't just about literature, but culture and history as well. 

I found the course to be extremely enlightening and interesting. The class includes three papers (the first is pretty easy, not really an essay), a fair amount of quizzes, and one final exam. Show up to lecture and read the stories (most of which are short and interesting) and you should get around a B range. Going into talk to TAs helps a huge amount with the papers.

delfino_andrew,5,A,ENGL393,Andy was a great online professor for professional writing. The videos he posted every week helped with understanding the weekly assignments that needed to be done. I loved the way he structured the online course and I loved the way he critiqued our assignments.

caneque,3,B?,HIST220,"Professor Caneque seems to forget that this is a lower level history course.  The amount of information gone over during class is absurd, can't imagine doing the reading too.  He grades pretty harshly, very few A's, mostly C's.  He's almost always in a bad mood.  Don't be tricked by his GPA on here, its mostly from upper level and graduate classes anyway.  If you're looking for an easy diversity requirement, do not take this.  If you're looking for an interesting history course that is going to require an absurdly disproportionate amount of time for what it should be, sure go ahead and enjoy.

I would rate this a 2.5 if I could, but I rounded up to 3.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have taken this course.  And I am a history major.",955
calloway,4,A,ENGL393,"Alexandra is a nice professor and if you put the necessary work into this class, you'll be fine.  As another reviewer pointed out, she allows you to rewrite pretty much any assignment in the course for a higher grade, which is great when you get a lower grade than you expected. She will also give you a lot of advice on how to improve your work if you ask her, making the rewrite policy very nice. She does only teach the class one night a week, so the 3 hour block can be kind of a drag, but she tends to do a decent job of making the class go by somewhat quickly, especially in the second half of the semester where most weeks there will either be some sort of class activity or a peer review. My one complaint is that, at the very beginning of the course, I was confused about when certain assignments were due, since the syllabus would show upcoming due dates for assignments we had not discussed, but she corrected this and it got better as the semester went on. You're probably required to take technical writing, but if you take it with Alexandra, it won't be that bad.",956
calloway,4,A,ENGL393,"Alexandra is a good professor. She gives you a lot of freedom in writing your papers about topics that you care about, which makes the course much more interesting and bearable. 
Her lectures are kind of boring and not that helpful, but what can you expect from an English class? She often lets the class out early which is awesome. 
She is very nice and responsive to student concerns.
She can be somewhat disorganized and there are too many documents and procedures for submission of assignments which is kind of annoying.
But overall I enjoyed this course very much. Just make sure to pick a final project that is easy so you don't get bogged down trying to finish it at the end of the semester.",956
calloway,4,A,ENGL393,"Work hard in her class and you should be rewarded. For your group project, make sure you ask her for advise before turning in your final copy.

calloway,5,A,ENGL393,"Professor Calloway cares about her students. She is very nice and understanding. She gives good comments and feedback in almost all her assignments but doesn't take many points off. If you do the assignments and show up to class, you will get an A even if you submit assignments late. Definitely an easy A course that I actually learned stuff in. She makes us read certain short articles and do simple assignments that teach you important aspects of technical writing and skills that you will definitely put to use in the workplace. She also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. I was probably putting, at most, an hour of work per week in this course.",956
calloway,4,A-,ENGL101S,"First off, she is a super nice lady and really cares about her students. The reason I could not give her a 5 is because she was extremely disorganized.

calloway,4,A+,ENGL297,"She is a very nice person and cares about her students. Her class was an hour and 15 minutes and for the most part, she just chatted about random stuff which was annoying. I'd rather be talking about the class but who am I to complain. The class is an easy A and she is willing to work with students. You don't need the team writing book and I found a pdf for the technical writing textbook. You only need to read the textbook when she assigns something related to it. It's common sense stuff though.

volk,2,B,ARTH488B,"This class is totally not worth it. Professor Volk has a very sweet voice makes you feel like you're doing great throughout the semester. She gives you vague critiques which also make you feel like you're doing great and did not hand back a single paper or grade the entire semester so you're left feeling like you did well (when you're probably behind). We also never had a grading rubric to tell us what she is looking for while grading our work.

She expects a lot from her students...to the point where she disregards most of us are full-time students and have other classes and homework to do on top of her class. 

The only up side to this course is if you're truly interested in Japanese Art, she is the person to talk to because she knows what she's talking about.",961
volk,1,C,ARTH290,"Do not take this class, especially not if you're taking a full load. Unfortunately the professor thinks that everyone is as interested in the subject as she is. Her lectures are boring. Every discussion, there is quiz on IDs from the previous class; but what if you haven't had time to study the IDs yet. Around Midterm and Finals time you will have to memorize around 100 slide IDs (artist, title, culture, medium, and time).  

Take something else if you're trying ti fulfill a core, if you must well I feel sorry for you. The 3 TAs were cool but they were strict and weren't a lot of help. My TA was like a mini Prof. Volk. Towards the end of the semester she got better. 

Moral of the story: avoid this class if you can. ",961
volk,2,,ARTH290,"Dr. Volk has the sweetest voice out of all the professors I have had. She also is the author of a pretty well written book. Her classes are fairly interesting but it is difficult to stay engaged with her monotonous voice. 

For the class, I really looked forward to it in the beginning of the semester. The readings were interesting and my TA seemed to know what was going on. But as the course went on, what Volk and the TA's expected of us seemed above and beyond what would be good enough for an A in a core class.

Here is what work they have you do: 
- memorize the title, artist, century, medium, and culture of a bunch of artwork that look the same,
- pop quizzes on what I listed above during discussion (any artwork discussed before is game)
- 2 reading responses (these are not too bad, but the second reading was a book that you had to rent for a maximum time of 2 hours at the art library. It was about 40 pages long.)
- keep up with the reading, which are occasionally discussed during discussion, which by the way goes into your participation grade. As said below, there is no actually textbook, but a bunch of photocopies of journals and articles and textbooks. So the resolution is terrible and font size is miniscule. Try reading at least 100 of those for the class. 
- 2 visual response papers that were graded way too harshly by the TA’s. I have a couple friends majoring in English and they both received C’s on their papers when they normally receive A’s on most of their English papers. One was terribly insulted with the TA suggested her to get hers edited by the English department before submitting the next one. 
- 1 midterm and 1 final. They are similar in format. Identifications with no word bank, comparing artwork, term definition with examples of artwork, and free responses. I remember students attacked professor Volk and the TA’s after the midterm because it was too much content in too little time. However grades were not adjusted. 

I do not believe there is a curve in the class. And grades were never posted on blackboard so you left in the dark. It took a while for the final grade to be posted and I am sure many students had their stomachs in knots waiting.

Please do not take this class with professor Volk. In person she is amazing but as an ARTH290 professor, please avoid her. ",961
volk,2,C,ARTH290,"First of all, let me just say that this class requires A LOT OF EFFORT. If you are looking for easy A, I would suggest you look somewhere else.

Now for the class itself, the material can be interesting, but failed to meet its potential. Attending lectures is a must, missing even one will put you behind. The professor will lecture with a semi-monotone voice because she loves the topic but does not know how to convey it in the most interesting way to the students.

The discussions go in deeper length with the topics in lectures. I HIGHLY SUGGEST you do the readings, no matter how long (average 20 pages) or boring (reading a textbook) they might be. This is because you need to know what's going on in discussions. You will have a ton of reading to do so do not let them snowball.

There are two visual analysis, midterm, and final. You will have to go to the Freer & Sackler Museums in DC for the visual analysis. You will need to master the art of rote memorization on the artworks and do every reading to get a good grade on the midterm and finals. 

This course is not for people who wish for a light workload intro to the topic of Asian Art. I recommend you take other courses because of the sheer work amount in this class. ",961
volk,1,B+,ARTH290,"This class was awful.  Definitely my worst choice.  We had nearly 100 notecards to memorize (which only sounds KINDA bad) but when you realize that the artists names are totally foreign, you need to know the date of the work, the medium, the title, and the country of origin, that makes nearly 500 things to memorize.  No one ever did the readings because they were in font size 8 and like 50 pages long (and they were hardly EVER addressed in lecture or discussion), but you were of course expected to know them on the test.  I didn't learn anything about the actual artists, most of this class is rote memorization.  I tried REALLY hard and I'm expecting a B+ if I'm lucky.  Oh, also, there are quizzes every week in discussion, and they don't post the slides on elms until after the quiz, so it's impossible to study for.  Don't take this class.",961
volk,2,,ARTH290,"If you have a choice, you shouldn't take this class. The material in interesting (after the midterm- the first half is almost entirely Buddhist art and if gets really repetitive) and Professor Volk seems like a really nice person but the expectations that either she or the TA's (I really don't know who set the guidelines) are too strict. For an introductory course, we're required more than is necessary. In the midterm, nobody had enough time to finish the long essay that was worth the most points because of the details she asked for in every other question. She doesn't give you much notice at all for papers, even though they require trips to the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian. You'll be spending a lot of money on Metro trips. Also, the fact that there wasn't a book, only collections of essays and articles on Elms (some of which were difficult to find) made it difficult to keep up, especially since we had up to six readings a week. 
Unless you've been dying to take a class on Asian art, I suggest you stay away from this.",961
volk,4,,ARTH290,"So what the reviewer below said about the course is true. It does have all those assignments described but it isn't as stressul as he/she makes it out to be. The main contributions to your grade are 2 visual analysis paper and your midterm and final. There are many readings to be done but I personally did not do a single one. They are supposed to be incorporated into the 2 exams but I didn't encounter anything I couldn't answer without the readings. Overall, the subject material is VERY interesting. Volk seems like an extremely nice person and her lectures are a pleasure to attend cuz she speaks so well and keeps everyone engaged. I loved the class and the professor. I would recommend it. The subject material is a little difficult to memorize due to the odd names but that really is only for the second part of the semester and can be dealt with easily if you keep up with the class discussions. Hope this helps and does not confuse you! :)",961
volk,1,C,ARTH290,"Do not take this class. It is definitely not worth it. Don't take this class if you don't have a lot of time on your hands. 
I do not hate the teacher as much as I hate the material and how the grades are construed.The professor's voice is ""soothing;"" she seems like a genuinely nice person. However, the material is too much. We have to memorize so so so many paintings and objects that all look the same. Further, the subjects and painters have really hard to pronounce/spell/remember names (e.g. Okumura Masanobu). It seems like an impossible feat if you have other hard classes. Also, we have a lot of readings (incorporated into the exams), visual analysis papers, response papers, worksheets, etc. The extra credit is only +1 point, but necessary since your grades will most likely suffer. You WILL go to the Freer Museum many many times throughout the semester (time-consuming + metro fees). After the withdrawal date, the teacher suddenly gives you an immense workload in a short period of time. 

I recommend saving yourself the pains of taking this class.   ",961
mclaughlin_matthew,5,A,ARTT110,"Matt McLaughlin is an experienced and respectable art professor. I took ARTT110 during the winter semester, and found that he worked well to encourage constructive criticism between students, not just dislike or praise on their own. 
In an online environment, he went the extra mile to set up still life sculptures and pieces for us to view and recreate, as well as always be available during the day to ask questions and receive feedback on padlet. The feedback was always honest, and technical. He did not necessarily comment on our ideas to change them, but our execution to bring them to fruition. I think this is a very good balance for an art professor to strike, and it was reflected in the attitude of the students as well. We were encouraged to go further out with our ideas, sometimes maybe too far away from the intended form, but to fully realize them nonetheless. 
He is also pleasant just to listen to, and hear about the people/places/pieces he draws his own inspiration from. ",971

She responds to emails pretty fast and is always willing to help. This was my first UL Phil class and it was a great class.,973
liberto,3,A,PHIL140,"Because of COVID, the class was asynchronous and I really only interacted with her once before the final. However, her recorded lectures were clear and helpful, and she obviously cares about what she is teaching. The class page on canvas is organized in a way that makes reviewing for tests easy and efficient, and Prof. Liberto is very helpful in answering questions about the material and the content of the class.
The one drawback is that there are not a lot of assignments, and the exams are not that easy. She curves them generously, but half of our grade came from the final (which is multiple choice) and the essay, so if you are looking for more security in which class you take, maybe pick a different one.",973

levine_robert,5,,ENGL301,"I really like Professor Levine, he truly is a good professor and engages with his students. He has a witty sense of humor too, and is open to all perspectives. I do think the readings are a bit dry like others have said, but he always makes it interesting when we talk about it in class by pointing out some things. If you participate more in class I think it's more interesting, so maybe it depends on who you are. However, I will say that for ENGL301 you're basically taking a version of american lit, and sometimes feels like a class about Frederick Douglass (I'm assuming bc that's what he studies and enjoys). I wish there was a bit more variety, even though we do study various things - they're shorter than the Douglass topics.

schonebaum,5,A,SLLC286,"extremely nice guy and really wants his students to succeed. He really hopes that students are actually learning rather than just getting through the class. This class was taught for the first time online (due to covid) so the few quizzes that we had and our midterm were on canvas. He always goes over the answers after. Most of the lectures are discussion based, we would just talk about the readings as a group or sometimes in break out rooms. There are readings assigned every week, but as long as you're paying attention and taking notes during lecture, you'll have all the information you need for the exam/quizzes. Great guy, who really cares about what he's teaching. Always in great spirits and just wants students to think and form ideas of their own. ",978
schonebaum,5,A+,SLLC286,"Prof. Schonebaum was a solid teacher and was super enthusiastic about what he was teaching. There was a decent amount of reading, but it was easy to find a balance once you started the course. Also, the entire course is discussion-based which means he will require you to speak and have your camera on for Zoom as well as participate in breakout rooms. The tests were easy multiple choice with thought-provoking short answers. He was  beyond reasonable with grading and I would argue that everyone should be getting an A (maybe a few B's).",978

The class itself is not that hard, and if you pay attention in lecture and participate in notetaking, you should be able to get a good grade in the class. Again, he clearly wants you to succeed. If you have a chance to take this class or any class taught by Prof. Andy, I highly suggest you take that opportunity. He is such a great guy and his class was one I looked forward to often.",978

schonebaum,5,A+,SLLC286,"Prof Schonebaum was really nice to have. He's pretty open with office hrs; I even found myself going a couple times to talk about the readings or whatever I was studying which related to them. Taking notes in the class can be a little difficult because he skips around topics a lot (granted, I took SLLC286 in spring 2020, in the middle of the transition to online learning); just make sure to keep your notes organized, and taking the exams should be fine.",978

Wolvin is a caring professor and a great person. He actually cares about each student improving as a listener. You know he cares when he gives you the opportunity to redo a paper if you really messed it up. Not many professors share this reasonable point of view. Just go to class and do the best you can on the writing assignments. ",979

szczepaniec-bialas,1,B-,ENGL391,Terrible experience. Class time is wasted going over random things and just going on tangents. She has no grade breakdown so it feels as though she just bases grades on who her favorites are.

I don't like either one of those things, but I still enjoyed the class because Dr. Colantuono is such a wonderful professor.  His lectures complement the textbook quite beautifully and it's always fascinating to hear him talk.  (He is a dynamic speaker and uses just the right amount of humor.)  This class has also helped me understand and appreciate literature and philosophy.  If you're intellectually curious then you can't do any better than Dr. Colantuono!",987
colantuono,3,B,ARTH201,"Professor was enthusiastic and definitally knew the material, but for a CORE HA requirement, I would NOT recommend this class. There is massive amounts of straight up memorization, and overall far too much effort for an HA requirement. For art majors, however, this class was appropriate.",987
colantuono,5,A,ARTH201,I like Dr. Colantuono. He talks pretty fast and it is important to take notes during the lectures. So be awake! It is also helpful to read the textbooks because one part of the exams is writing a comparative essay between two given art works. You need to include stuff from both the textbooks and the lectures. It is VERY annoying to memorize all the dates. There are a lot of paintings to remember. But it is an interesting class. I think TA is also important because I think I got A because of the discussion section.,987
colantuono,5,A,ARTH201,He is an amazing lecturer really eloquent stuff. its always interesting listening to him talk and he obviously knows art history like the backside of his hand. He'll talk about the history and context behind the painting and then go in to analyzing the painting itself which he'll tie into the philosophy of the artist or art of that time. The class is not too difficult but i though it was interesting which helped. If you go to lecture and take good notes and study before exams you'll do well. Its annoying memorizing dates and patrons and stuff but not too difficult. Besides the exams there are quizzes in discussion and a 3 page paper. ,987
colantuono,4,A,ARTH201,"I disagree with the poster below. Dr. Colantuono was really a really good lecturer and really knew his stuff. He made Art History interesting for someone who only had to take it for an HA. Don't take it for an easy A though...you gotta put in the work, go to class, take notes (all the tests came from lecture, hardly used the book at all), study. There's a quiz in discussion every other week too which is annoying.",987
colantuono,1,F,ARTH201,"He is a tough cookie.  I do not like the his exam style. And he is really specific about his term paper.  If you have a great TA then you can probably do well and enjoy the class, I had Adam and he was a jerk unless you talk to him 1 on 1. 
So... do not take this class unless it is mandatory.  And if you do, make sure its Majorie Venit or ... anyone but this dude!",987

borrut,5,A,HIST120,"One of the best (if not the best) history professors at UMD. Keeps you engaged in lecture and is very helpful during office hours. He is invested in seeing his students do well and has a good sense of humor. 

HIST120 has a good bit of reading and a lot of dates. Building a chronology is pretty much essential to doing well in the class. However, the material is incredibly interesting and I learned a significant amount about Islamic culture because of it.

Easily my favorite class so far at Maryland and highly recommended.",988
borrut,5,A,HIST120,"I took HIST120 my freshman year and fell in love with Islamic history all because of Professor Borrut. He is one of the top professors at Maryland. Not only does he know what he's talking about, but he passes on that knowledge in an interesting and clear way. He wants you to learn, and it shows. He is extremely available and helping his students excel is his main priority.

HIST120 is a basic introduction to early Islamic history, and is not too hard. There are 3 essay exams, but you review in discussion, so you have no reason to be unprepared for the questions. Discussion is mandatory, and you discuss certain readings. You can guess which reading is going to be discussed so you do not need to read them all.

I loved Professor Borrut's class so much that I decided to take HIST429Y with him. This class was much more difficult than 120, but it was very interesting and we were able to discuss topics in depth which was great. The readings can be hard to keep up with, but as long as you do 2 of them or are good at bs-ing in class you'll be fine. The papers are only based on that week's readings so don't worry about keeping up with each article in depth. The papers are long but not so difficult. I would recommend giving in a rough draft beforehand for him to look at so you can edit to make it what he is looking for. I'm a business major, and got A's on all of my papers.

Overall, if you don't want to work, don't take his class. But if you're looking to learn a lot from an intelligent and attentive professor then I would highly recommend taking a class with Professor Borrut.",988
borrut,5,B-,HIST429Y,"Well, Hist429Y: ""Islamic Memory,"" was a seminar class I took with Professor Borrut in Fall '11.  In all honesty, I think I learned more in this class than any class that I've ever taken and I looked forward to it very much; and I'm a senior in History.  That being said, however, it was second only to my SENIOR THESIS class in difficulty: two 10pg papers and a final 12pg.  Like the other reviews say, he is a nice guy and is very helpful and available, but the level of work required in this class was astounding; also don't be an idiot and plagiarize, a number of people were hit for it.  If you're looking for a class where you will profoundly learn something from an expert and aren't afraid of 6-10 readings per week, this is your class; if you are looking for a gimmie class however, do not even waste your time.

israel_michael,2,,ENGL384,"You should definitely take ENG384 if you hate yourself. Nothing against Professor Israel. He's an ok guy and I guess he does what he can to teach such an awful subject but the class is probably the equivalent of torture. Concepts of Grammar is the biggest waste of time I have ever sat through for an entire semester. I've never hated linguistics more than I do after completing this course. Not that I ever liked linguistics, but I didn't really have a problem with it until now. 

Let me be clear, you think you know grammar but you don't. I promise you that. This class isn't just commas and apostrophes, it's words I've never even heard of in my life. Sentence constructs that even google can't explain. Unless this all sounds super fun to you (I could never understand why), do NOT take this class. Trust me, you will regret it.",989
israel_michael,2,B-,ENGL385,"I refuse to believe that anyone but Israel himself wrote the reviews below me, because no one in my class save maybe 4-5 people (it's a 30 person class) would say these things, ever.
To start with, Israel, while a nice guy, cannot explain anything to save his life. Our class gets sidetracked so horrendously by RANDOM subjects that by the end of the class we'll have gone from point A and end at point 8g9b. Does that make sense? No? Well that's my point. 

Most students realize that going to his actual class is a waste of time since nothing is explained well at all, and so the 30 person class has about 50% attendance at most at any given day. You're required to turn in a written assignment every week, but he takes them late at full credit so most of the people around me in the class are behind by about 2 or 3 assignments at any given time. You can also turn them in via email, which doesn't exactly motivate anyone to show up to class either. 

The person a few comments below me stated that the assignments take around 6 hours long. Child, if you spend 6 hours on these writing assignments you're doing something wrong. 1 hour tops, and that timeframe includes skimming the book because you didn't go to class and need to know the basics of whatever you need to write about. 

To put it bluntly, don't take this class. Teacher isn't helpful, class is useless, and it's not an easy A so there's no point in suffering through it for an entire semester.",989

HOWEVER, this class is tough and the homework(s) will take A LONG TIME.(minimum 6hours) each.

Theres 3 major papers that contribute to your grade, but they aren't difficult to write, as long as you understand the prompt.

The class itself is interesting, though if you pay attention and review the material, it's easy. He does take home exams, which are a god send in my opinion. ",1001
cooperman,4,A,HIST135,"Professor Cooperman is a funny guy that brings a lot of energy even to very early lectures. The lectures are a bit confusing in terms of their importance, but you definitely need to do the readings and get the gist of what is being talked about. Discussion is vital as there are weekly quizzes and a more focused explanation about things. 

This course is tremendously back loaded in terms of workload, so be prepared for that. The tests are not hard at all as you always are given exactly what you need to do well. 

",1001
cooperman,4,,HIST135,"I'm no history major, so I'm not sure about how he is compared to other history professors, but if, like I did this past semester, you need to finish an I-series requirement and can't find one you're interested in, Cooperman and his history course that's all about riots is an okay choice. 

There are two lectures a week and one discussion section per week. During lectures he talks about certain riots and how they relate to the class as a whole, the readings, and how they might help your essays you'll write later on. He uses powerpoint, but he goes through them quickly so be careful not to get a hand cramp from writing too much too quickly. In retrospect, what he has to say was probably more important that what was on the slides. His TA accompanies him in class while he lectures. The TA, however, mostly sits there, listening, though he does occasionally chime in with questions and thoughts for the class, and helps Cooperman with names of events and people when he can't quite come up with them himself. 

To encourage you to come to class, he awards participation points through slips of paper that you sign and return to the TA if you earn one in class. To earn one, you need to do one of two things. 1: Answer a question(intelligently, that is), whether you're lucky enough to get him to acknowledge your raised hand or unlucky enough to have him put you on the spot when you can't quite process what he said fast enough, or 2: Come to class with a riot ready to present for the class briefly but completely. Either be prepared to answer subsequent questions about it from the TA(he was a PhD history student, so he keeps up with these things; he knows just about ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING; it's kind of scary to a non-history buff like me), or provide a complete enough speech about it that he doesn't feel the need to ask questions. If you struggle to quickly digest what Cooperman said in lecture, way number 2 is how you're going to have to get them. You need 5 paper slips to get full lecture participation credit, and I had to get all 5 from riot presentations. Just come in with a riot ready every single class, and if the TA wants riots, you'll be ready. If not, save it for next time. Have a backup riot just in case someone uses yours and happens to go before you (though you could be awesome like I was and do enough work on it to expand on what was said before and get a slip that way :D ). Do what you gotta do to get those paper slips. 

In lecture, Cooperman may put you on the spot with a question, but in discussion, the TA will NEVER call on you without your wanting to. It sounds like a relief, but  you still need to answer questions and participate in intelligent discussion about the readings and debates you were assigned in order to get discussion participation points (they are different from lecture participation points). The first half of them comprised of debates about a riot; you participate in one and observe the others. The second half involved breaking off into groups and reading together, preparing to answer questions he asks afterward. One of the last discussions involves an 8-minute presentation among your five-person group over a riot. Cooperman made a surprise appearance, so be ready for that and make it good, though my section was apparently the only one he appeared in.

There are a few papers in this course. One is about the portrayal of riots in certain movies you have to watch (there's a list, so pick your favorites or the shortest ones). Another is about a riot that you did your group presentation with. The last one is an evaluation of an argument for an author on a book I can't remember off the top of my head. Blah blah blah, don't leave them to the last minute, remember your bibliography, don't exceed the maximum page count. You'd be surprised how much you have to cut out to meet the page constraints; the TA won't read past the 5th page in a 5-page paper, for instance.

There is a midterm and a final. The midterm consists of an essay on a book and some ""IDs."" IDs are basically the ""who, what, where, when, and why"" on riots, people, another other things emphasized in the course. Essay was graded surprisingly easily in my opinion. The outline is the most important part, in case you run low on time. The final consists of IDs only, and there is a list of IDs given that might possibly be on the exam. They emphasize that the paper on the author is ""part of the final exam"", but it's really just the IDs. They give you lots of time and you should be prepared with them.

And that's Cooperman's HIST 135. He's funny; he tries to engage the class whenever he gets the sense that people are getting bored. Lots of readings to go over, so keep up with those. The syllabus is online, but it CHANGES OVER TIME, so keep an eye on it regularly. Again, if you need an I-series/diversity/history/social sciences course for your gen-ed requirements and couldn't find anything interesting, this is at least a decent choice. It knocks out a lots of requirements at once and you probably won't be bored. (Wow, that was long. Sorry about that... just trying to help future students, that's all.)",1001
cooperman,4,A,,"Dr. Cooperman is a great professor, and very enthusiastic about his material, in addition to possessing a good sense of humor.

He is not a harsh grader, but it takes forever for him to get anything back, especially as the semester draws to a close.

His tests were fair, especially since he gave us a term sheet and three essay questions where we would only have to write one on the test day.

His TA literally graded everything, and although Cooperman was very nice, his TA was a bit more strict when it came to grading. I never heard of anyone ever getting above a 95% on essays, and it seems like 85% was the norm. I would make sure to read the books he assign, though get them from the library since you'll need each one for maybe two classes max.

As for grading, he isn't the type to hand out A's left and right, but I wouldn't consider him a hard grader. As long as you put in the work he will give you a good grade and he's really open to chatting before/after class about any assignment and lets you know exactly what he needs on each essay/discussion.

Dr. Richter provides a ton of great supplementary sources that are very in-depth and enriching. The only qualm I had with Dr. Richter was that I think he can improve the logistics/structure of his live online lectures, the live online lectures seemed too improvisational and Dr. Richter seemed to ramble on sometimes.

blair,5,B,PHIL100,"He sets very clear expectations for what will be on the quiz (if you know what i mean lol). His lectures are boring, 90% of people dont pay attention in class, but whenever he goes off task, he is social and funny. If you just show up to the lectures, expect a B-. All of the tests are essays so you should go to office hours if you want to learn what he is looking for.  Also, he seems a little crazy, just like every philosophy professor. He opened his first lecture about how he grades finals (just enough Scotch to not get drunk, enough Excedrin to get acetaminophen jitters). He pauses in between sentences to compose his thoughts, but literally every single sentence he says is something very detailed, almost like straight off a dissertation.

ALSO: he repeats this in class a lot (easily 5 times): ""When I made the test, it seemed like I taught you all nothing, but then I looked back at my notes and I realized I taught you too much.""

collier_michael,5,A,ENGL243,"Great professor. Really nice, engaging (for a poetry professor), and never condescends to students. Made poetry bearable for me.

As for the grades, discussion participation is worth 10%, the first exam 15%, midterm and final 30%, and an in-class writing makes up the final 15%. For my year the final was a joke (96% was the average), but the midterm and in-class writing was graded semi-harshly. Just make sure to go to class and take notes.

I hope that the final isn't difficult. You have two poems to memorize for this course, which I personally think is bs. I am glad I can get my core over with after this. I can definitely say that this is the easiest HL core, if you are a busy science major like I am.

The exams were not overly difficult, the term paper was actually fun to write, and all the readings are extremely interesting and will challenge your beliefs about how we interact with the environment.

A native speaker of spanish, she seems to have little grasp of the english language and the one time I went to her to ask a question Im pretty sure she didnt understand what I was saying and did not help answer my question whatsoever.

She had us drop off our term paper in her mailbox on the last day of finals, and at the time she said it would be open it was closed. She also had a substitute teacher come to class on the day we had our MIDTERM so we couldnt ask questions, and did not let us know in advance that she was going to do that.

She most certainly plays favorites, and if youre shy to talk in class she wont like you. She also cares more about quantity over quality. I found that while writing decent things but in shorter lengths she gave me bad grades. When I lengthened what I was writing, though not adding any better content, she gave much higher grades.

Make sure you write a lot and include a lot of facts.

I needed a core history credit for what was my government major at the time, so I looked up random courses and took 289E solely on Bell's amazing reviews. I have no interest in the American Revolution or early American history in general. 

But I am so glad I took that course. Professor Bell could make any course come alive, ANY COURSE, and that's what made 289E one of my favorite classes thus far. Professor Bell and I met a few times and he convinced me to become a history major, which I am today. I took his 156 course this semester. 

Yeah, I have no interest in early American history and I've now taken 2 semesters in a row of it, that covers mostly the same time period. I'd take any class Professor Bell teaches. He gets to know every student's name (in a large lecture hall) and thinks highly of his students and their intellectual capabilities. 

Cannot recommend him enough. ",1025
bell_richard,5,B,,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Lecture was fun to go to, as he was very funny and engaging. Routinely makes jokes at the expense of students (in a harmless way.) 

Class itself wasn't too bad. 2 essays, around 5-6 pages each. One on some readings; one involving you going to the Smithsonian (!) to look at some paintings and to write down things about them, and then relate them to the course. Exams were not easy, mainly because the pool of possible IDs was so large. 

Discussion was key, participate at least twice a day for full credit. My TA was also good and always helpful (Allison), especially regarding the Smithsonian visit.

If you are looking for an easy A, I do not recommend this class. However, if you are looking to take a class with one of the best professors at Maryland, I highly recommend it.",1025
bell_richard,4,B,,"Looks like I'm the first person to review him for this class. First off, he is a WONDERFUL teacher. His lectures are awesome and engaging. He tells a story every time, and the class material is actually very interesting (note class to left).

However, I was taking this class as a core, and I would say definitely don't do that if you are looking for an easy A. He only gives out 3 big assignments (3 essays) but they are some of the hardest essays I have ever had to write. They require a lot of research, and a lot of time there is no clear answer to the question, and the TA's standards were not very clear.

The final exam is going to seem impossible (He'll give you a list of 80+ IDs to remember, a possible 8 essay questions, of which he'll pick 5 and 1, repectively), but in reality, it wasn't too bad.

Advice if you are going to take the class: Attending lecture isn't pertinent, but will help you remember things. Take very organized notes, I would recommend typing them, as when he gives you the list of IDs, you can just Control-F to find them for the final.

He has occasional guest speakers; some a re good, others not so much, but this is a new class so I expect it will get better in that regard.

Overall, awesome teacher, hard essays, weird grading scale (grades on like a 9 point system instead of 10), seemingly impossible final but just take good notes during the semester and it won't be too bad.",1025

The class had two papers, a midterm, and a final.  The work was challenging, but very manageable.

We only had one long essay and we got multiple weeks to perfect it. If you bring her your writing she will tell you exactly what she is looking for so you know you will be getting a decent grade. She also makes the homeworks a large part of the grade and since they are just for completion, it is a great boost.

However, he says more in lectures that he puts on the power points so you'll need to fill in the gaps with notes. 

The exams were essay-based, but he gives you a review which is really helpful.  At the end of the semester I had to do a 7 page paper on a topic of my choice.

Unless this terrible structure changes, I won't recommend this class to anyone. 

On the bright side, the midterm questions were given ahead of time as a study guide and he gave us an option to either do a paper (bleh) or to do a presentation on two short stories (guess which the class picked). It was a rather stress-free class but it wasn't easy - overall you should have known something to get an A.

For ENGL 134 you have to do the readings to do well, but the readings are always interesting and you're given a reasonable window in which to read them. She's super modern and won't bore the hell out of you like many other professors. For this class we get to watch things like American Horror Story and Black Panther, and we got to read modern literature (I, Tituba,  Black Witch of Salem).

My main criticism is that Scott tends to read verbatim from presentations and handouts in class, using time that would be better spent peer-reviewing, and he has some odd criteria for some assignments.
I'd advise taking the blended section if it's available; less time in class means more time to get the work done.",1040

Lecture:
When we went we usually did in class peer review or Moses spoke more specifically about the current paper requirements. You are graded on attendance, but you don't get points for going, you only lose points for not going.

Book:
The book is MyTechCommLab which is an online book type thing. It is rather annoying, and is in desperate need of a competent webmaster to revise the site. Other than that I would say that about 50% of the assigned reading and activities were helpful, and all the rest were stupid (like stuff I knew in 5th grade, or repetitive stuff). Also it's mostly a completion grade, if your quiz grades are too low he takes off points.

Papers and stuff:
I thought he was a somewhat lenient grader, just compared to who I had for ENGL101. He was pedantic as other reviewers have said, but I didn't feel that he took off a lot of points, he just critiques everything.

Suggestions:
Start early on the final project, like start during spring break or in the fall semester start in October. I'm not kidding, just send some emails to your audiences and ask to interview them, it will REALLY help out.
Also, I got a lot out of this class because I did all the readings and put a lot of effort in. Most of my classmates didn't, but I really do think that this class actually taught some important concepts. Despite being an English class, the content is very useful.

Grading:
Online stuff (turning things in on time and MyTechCommLab stuff): 25%
Resume/Cover Letter: 10%
Definition: 10%
Proposal: 20%
Instructions: 10%
Final Project: 25% ",1040
moses,3,B,ENGL101,"This class is English 101 so you will have quite a bit of writing to do. Moses does a fine job in teaching how to write these papers with samples of his own writing. There are only 5 papers in the class with the final paper worth the most. It's best to start your readings and do your best on early (easy, short) papers so you won't be dragged down by later (long, research) papers.

As for the class itself, he takes attendance so you HAVE to come to class. If you miss more than 6 classes, he might dock your grade by one letter grade if I remember correctly. When you do peer review, make sure to actually write your rough draft because your classmates will be able to help you point out structural and grammar mistakes you missed. 

Overall this should be a manageable class if you do your readings and start your papers early. You can definitely get an A in this class if you really work for it.",1040
moses,3,,ENGL393,"Moses is a relatively nice guy, but definitely pedantic and can come across as a bit uptight. His criticisms are on point, but he does hold the bar rather high given the demographic of students taking his courses (non-English majors coupled with the average student writing level at Maryland). If we weren't upperclassmen, I'd say his class stands a chance at improving you writing. But as is, it just brings out the already-existing discrepancies in everyone's writing abilities. ",1040
moses,5,A,ENGL393,"This class is a bit of a drag. As the other review says, the entire course revolves around one single project that makes up about 40% of your grade (the final paper is 25%). I would advise anyone taking ENGL393 with Moses to take this class seriously. When he asked the first day of class what people had heard about it, many said it was an easy A. To this day, I think he made it his mission to prove that fact wrong. 

He can be pedantic, fussy, and annoying at times with his comments but he was always right. Once you learn how he grades, you should do fine. As he always says, your audience is the most important aspect of your writing. He's your audience, so figure out how he likes things done to do well.",1040
moses,3,B+,ENGL393,"I sort of went into the class with the mentality that it was just a stupid requirement, that the professor would be laid-back, and it would be a pretty easy A. Not quite the case.

This guy will make you work. The entire course revolves around a giant semester-long recommendation report. Come to think of it, it's a really useful assignment, and it does a fabulous job of preparing you for the ""real world,"" but I'm just too lazy for that. So far I've learned quite a bit, but most of the subject matter is about functioning in a corporate desk job and dealing with an administration. What a drag.",1040

keener,5,A-,ARTT200,Great guy who is really nice and knowledgeable about a lot of things. He has a lot of experience working with well known artists and producing art himself. I took him for 200 and 479E and he was great for both,1044
pfister,5,A+,COMM401,"Professor Pfister and his TA's were great, especially during this pandemic. All assignments, except the exams, could be turned in late because they were cognizant that COVID-19 was a weird and tough time for a lot of people. The exams were exceptionally fair and open note. They asked for an acted upon feedback from students mid-semester.

Assignments wise, there were 3 exams (non-cumulative),  weekly reflections on readings (200-400 ish words), 2 short papers, a group project that was like a podcast (15 minutes), small video assignment (group or individual), and some in class participation points. The lectures were asynchronous and came in podcasts with associated readings. They had transcripts for these lectures as well. The discussion were held every other week and were synchronous. ",1045
moller,4,A-,PHIL100,"The lectures are the best part. He makes it into a discussion, and asks students questions on the topics at hand. He also goes over the readings quite thoroughly. There's a problem with that, though.
In going over the readings during lecture, there is nothing to talk about in the discussion section. My TA was absolutely horrid. Even though she had a deep understanding of the material, any time she attempted to create an example for us to analyze using what we learned in lecture, she'd get confused and it would only get more and more convoluted as other people attempted to make sense of what she was saying. It was bad.
However, Professor Moller is an excellent speaker. He makes jokes about the topic every once in a while, and he's very down to earth. He encourages people to ask him any questions they might have if they're struggling with anything, but he's not a mind reader. You have to take responsibility and ask for help.",1046
moller,5,A,,"Professor Moller is an incredible teacher. Extremely personable, and great at distilling the important material from the weekly readings. Class discussions were consistently engaging. 

The material in PHIL440 is also really interesting. Highly recommend it. 

There were two papers (~2200 words and ~2800 words respectively). Moller went over his expectations for these very clearly. There was one midterm and one final, both consisting of short answer questions about the course material. Also, there were sporadic quizzes (T/F) on the weekly readings.",1046
moller,5,A,,"This class with Dr. Moller was great. He is an excellent professor, very fair and he challenges his students. The material is very challenging and you will have to work hard, but it is very rewarding.

Highly recommended. ",1046
moller,5,B,,"Professor Moller is hands down one of the best professors in the philosophy department. He is clearly very intelligent, evidenced by the way he presents his lectures and the course material. You have to do the readings, and go to class because he doesn't post up slides or notes on Blackboard. His lectures are engaging, and not purely a recitation of what you've just read. I definitely recommend taking a course with him if you're a Philosophy major and/or just looking to take a course in Philosophy.",1046
moller,5,A,PHIL100,"This class is much harder than what you would expect from a 100 level course (the easy philosophy cource is 140), and Moller definitely makes it more challenging. There's a lot of assigned readings, and they are really hard to comprehend. You don't have to understand them, or even read them, just go to class and take notes. He covers whatever he thinks is important and that's exactly what he's gonna test you on. 

Even though Moller isn't what you would call a ""fun teacher"" (it'd be hard to find one in philosophy), he does try to engage the class. But if philosophy isn't something that really interests you, don't take it with MOller, cuz his monotone voice will drive you to sleep in 5 minutes. But if you are interested, Moller will prepare you for higher level courses. 

Like I said, the tests are tough (you have to memorize a lot of different theories and arguments) and people tend to run out of time, but they aren't tricky. The essays are probably the most challenging part; if you can't write well, don't take this class. You'll want to kill yourself. ",1046
moller,2,,PHIL100,"Going class for the first time, if you decide to sit in the back, Moller does not speak very loud and is very difficult to hear him at first. The TA i had was not very engaging and made discussions boring. The exams are short answers but if you do not answer them very thoroughly you could possibly get 0 pts for them. When i was struggling in the class, he barely gave any feedback or advice on what to do, so I dropped the class. ",1046
moller,5,A,,Great professor. Always willing to provide feedback on ideas and presents material very clearly. The discussions in class are also very engaging. If you are interested at all in moral philosophy make sure to take at least one class with him.,1046
moller,5,B,PHIL100,"Overall the class is great. Only negative thing is that his lectures are boring, I fell asleep alot in his lecture. His grading system is great. His papers are also very easy (even though its long). Its all opinionated paper. He also has 1 midterm and its easy. He curves it if the average is low. Overall the class is great. Also do the readings when it is assigned. I did not, and when I read them before the final they were super interesting.  Also learned alot from the class.",1046
moller,4,B,PHIL100,Really hard grader but really interesting lecturer. I’m sad he teaches asynchronously. I’m not a philosophy person but he really opened my eyes to it. Not an easy class though. ,1046
saalfeld,4,A-,ENGL393,"Technical Writing with Saalfeld is an alright experience. Saalfeld himself is a good guy and he provides useful insight on technical reports. He can be boring as he likes to read word for word directly off papers to you in a rather monotone voice. The entire class revolves around a final project where you have to research and propose a solution to a problem. He grades pretty fairly, so do the work and you'll be fine. Don't be absent to many times, because if you are then 10% of your grade is gone. ",1047
saalfeld,4,A,ENGL393,"This is a really easy class. He is a very liberal grader. And the class is mostly presentations and a project throughout the semester. You have to do a giant group research project and write about it. Most lectures were just student presentations about various weekly assignments. But quite easy stuff.If you have to take ENGL393, definitely take it with Saalfeld for an easy A. And as long as you don't completely ignore the assignments or coming to class, you will do fine.",1047
saalfeld,5,A+,ENGL393,Amazing professor. Really liked his class. Even though it was too much work his directions and rubrics made it lot easier. Took it online ,1047
saalfeld,2,,ENGL393,"He's really not that bad, but the final project is individual and not as a group and he bans over a dozen topics for the final paper including on campus issues, curriculum changes, legislation changes, fraternity/sorority related, big issue/global issues, social problems, business plans, traffic on 495, and more. ",1047
saalfeld,4,A,ENGL393,"Mixed feelings. I don't think taking ENGL393 with Professor Saalfeld is very difficult (his grading is fair), but it's a decent amount of work. Occasionally he would send us very passive aggressive emails when a chunk of the class missed an instruction, however some of these instructions are buried in large walls of text that he gives us for assignments, so I wish that he cut the students a little more slack at times.

His deadlines are fair and he works hard to be available for students during office hours and outside appointments. There's a lot of small grades throughout the semester that will help carry you when the real papers come. There were 2 long essays that we wrote in class with multiple activities that lead up to them to help us get the best grade possible. The 2 essays go hand in hand, so it wasn't so tedious. Also, we got to choose our topic, so it was more fun to write. At the end of the semester, we made websites out of our topics, which is a lot of work but it's much better than writing another essay. He is also one of the only professors that don't require purchase of the ENGL101 book, which saves you $100 !",1050

-He doesn't over lecture.
-pushes deadlines all the time to give students more time work on papers
-easy-going and approachable
-flexible office hours
-assignments are relatively easy (other than the actual big papers which just take awhile to do)
-Some things I would say that aren't great about him is that he is a VERY SLOW grader. He takes forever to give back feedback. This can be annoying and stressful because the big papers you work on in this class have to do with one another. So he says he'll give back feedback on Tuesday and never does.

The fact that he brings in muffins to class sometimes doesn't make up for it.",1054

the Bad:  Extremely tough grader who plays favorites.  I consider myself a pretty good writer (if the grades in my other courses are any indication) but i could never figure out what exactly he wanted out of an essay.  i think my best essay grade was a B- and I thought it was an A or A-.  Also come to class prepared or he will embarrass you just to make a point.  
if you take his class make sure you read everything, go to every class and talk to him about what he's looking for out of your writing but even if you do all of that your grade might just be average.",1056
sartorius,4,A-,HIST473,"I had Prof. Sartorius for HIST 473, and I didn't think it was too bad. He says on the first day that the class isn't about beaches and drinking in the Caribbean, and he means it. He can be tough, so get ready to read, but I didn't think the amount of reading was anything extra insane. He wants arguments and interpretations about history, not just facts or summary. So if you can't come up with arguments for weekly assignments, watch out. My biggest issues were some of his classroom policies. If you aren't there when he calls your name on roll but come in literally 2 seconds after, you're done. If you have food or a loud drink, you're done. If, Heaven Forbid, your phone goes off, you're REALLY done. He also hates sleepers. So you have to make the choice to either bring a drink like tea or pepsi, or sleep. Oh, and don't ask any questions, interrupt him, or dare to get up and use the restroom. He'll either be a loose cannon about stuff like that, or say nothing. But you know what he's thinking-""that you're sooo done."" All in all, its not easy but you can learn alot. It's a pretty good choice if you have to take a 400 class, but remember it's 400. Make sure you participate EVERY LECTURE, and you'll get through it. :)",1056

sartorius,1,,HIST339A,"One of the hardest and most stressful classes I've ever taken at UMD. Not sure if this is a problem he only had with online teaching, but he refused to update grades at all. When you were lucky enough to find out your grade on one single assignment, it would be a vague letter grade. The assignments never made any sense. Especially the final wiki project. Some of the readings were interesting, and a good professor could have ran with them, but I never felt like he taught me anything. He also just is not very empathetic and accommodating at all. ",1056

sartorius,1,C-,HIST339A,"He does not tell you a single grade throughout the entire semester- no way to tell your stance in the course nor measure your progress. Excepts way too much from his students, especially during a pandemic, and can be outright rude when there are differing opinions between him and the students. He used the pandemic to justify being behind on grading, but would rarely give out any extensions or accommodations for students who had been personally impacted by COVID. There was one student who had to get an emergency surgery one week and they asked for an extension on that week's work and he responded that it would be more convenient for him if she didn't get an extension. So clearly no empathy towards his students. Some interesting readings though. ",1056

Don't expect a syllabus until weeks into the class. Don't expect a grade on ANYTHING until the last week of class. AND THEN HE HAS THE NERVE TO CRITIQUE PAPERS ALL LATE. No one even likes coming to class. No one even likes him. He thinks he's funny. He's not. He makes jokes and imitates people with accents, which is not funny. It's rude. Gives you an assignment that is due after people graduate which MAKES NO SENSE. Bad, just very bad.",1057
sicilia,4,B+,HIST136,"This class was okay. Material was very dry, and discussions were beyond boring. Unfortunately, the lectures were at 9:30 in the morning, so attendance was small, but there was no final exam--only a midterm and a final project, which was not overly hard.

Prof. Sicilia, however, is a great professor. He knows his material, and he has a very dry sense of humor, which is hilarious if you understand it and are actually paying attention. HIST136 was not a great class, but if I had to take another history class, I would definitely take one with Sicilia. It may be tough to pull out the grade you want, but if you are willing to work for it, it's worth it.",1057
sicilia,4,,,"He is hilarious, which is what makes this class so enjoyable. It's a lot of information during class, so be prepared to take good notes. 2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final - and he instructs the TAs to grade very strictly. Plus, there is a lot of reading to do for the class. 

Overall, though, highly recommended.",1057
sicilia,4,A,,"Given that it was his first time teaching this course, it was very poorly structured. We didn't really start working till 3 weeks into school. Basically, the course consists of weekly readings, which aren't too bad and a weekly reaction paper. There are two exams and a participation grade. There is also a ten-page paper. It's pretty easy if you are good at history. 

You just talk about the readings. 
The first half of the class was a little dry because it was pre-20th century. The second half picked up because it focused on today's issues. 

Sicilia is a good guy and he's got a dry wit. He's flexible and is willing to push stuff back or talk about your grade. 

It was a good course, all things considered because it was pretty easy. Sicilia wasn't very organized ever, but he's a good guy and knew some stuff.",1057
sicilia,5,,,"If you're going to take history and are not a history major, by all means take Sicilia. He's SO funny, and has a very dry wit, and not to mention he keeps you engaged in the lecture.

sicilia,5,A,HIST136,"I loved Scilia. He has a monotone voice, but he is extremely funny and uses a lot of dry humor/sarcasm (but he's also really nice, not a jerk). Lectures were great, I really enjoyed each one. You pretty much have to go to lecture since his slides don't have much info. Exams were easy, there were 1 or 2 and the final was the same format. He would give you 5 essay questions the week prior to the exam, and 2 of them appear on the exam. As long as you go to lecture and have a clue as to what's going on, they're pretty straightforward. There was one final paper which was ~8 pages and you had to watch a movie, which honestly was my least favorite part of the class.

As for discussion, it all depends on who your TA is and the people in your discussion. I had a great TA (shout out to Kyle) and in our discussion we were pretty much all involved. As long as you read the material, it's actually a lot of fun. Kyle allowed for some really interesting open ended discussions.

10/10 would recommend this course, interesting and really easy.

",1057
sicilia,5,A,HIST136,"As a first-semester freshman, Professor Sicilia is my favorite professor so far. He does have a somewhat monotone voice but he is SO FUNNY so that it makes his voice bearable. He does pretty funny impressions to keep the dry course material entertaining. There are weekly 2-point 250 word essays based on that week's readings. If you do make time to do the readings every week (usually quite a few pages) you're pretty much guaranteed to get a 2/2 on each one.

His midterm and final are essays and he gives you a list of possible prompts around a week before, so you have time to make notes on what you want to say. Relatively easy with grading, as long as you have good grammar and reference material from class and reading. That said, his tests will not be the ones you are most concerned about during midterm/finals week.

He really is an interesting man. He's not afraid to say inappropriate things. He has many works published and definitely knows his history, but doesn't expect you to know more than what he says in class. I really suggest talking to him before or after class because he is really easy to talk to and will be helpful if you have any questions.

However, he is always happy, cracking jokes, talking about interesting current events, etc. I have only missed his class once all semester, and I wish I didn't even miss that class.

I honestly would have aced this class but it was my discussion part that killed me. I had Greg as a TA and he talked so much and we barely had time to participate.. so yeah participate for sure every week in discussion.

Otherwise, this class is great! A great, light class if you are looking for something to fulfill a GenED credit. ",1069

I’m going to be blunt- I took this class because I had a heavy semester and I needed a GenEd course that was an easy A, and reviews told me that this class would get me one. However, I barely scraped an A- because I hardly participated in class. Dr. Smead is serious when he says discussion is a big part of your grade. He’s a very easy grader for the three essays and one presentation you have to give, but don’t slack on the discussion part. He makes a note every time you participate in discussion, so say something at least once every class to ensure you get an A. There is hardly any work for this class actually, just three essays and a presentation for the whole semester. If I wasn’t being a prick and doing work for other classes during this class, I probably would have learned a bit. Then again, I’m not a fan of history, but if you enjoy your history, I recommend this professor because he knows his shit.",1069

He always seems so interested in what he is teaching. I actually looked forward to his lectures. The class was only 3 exams and reading several books.

He really knows his stuff and is interesting to listen to if you have all day...but if you don't, I recommend listening to his lectures at 1.5-2x speed. He often goes off on tangents which can be frustrating when you're not interested in the subject but I imagine could be interesting if you are. He's a goldmine of knowlege for sure. My main complaint would be that he leaves so much up to his TAs - they can make or break a class. My TA, Kyle Stelzer, was ok but didn't respond to emails very quickly. ",1069

smead,5,A,HONR238R,"Difficulty: 2.5/5

Professor Smead is a great lecturer, and he is very willing to speak his mind while never crossing lines into being preachy or imposing his will unduly on students. The assignments were reasonable and interesting; they consisted of: a presentation and corresponding term paper, two brief reflections, a journal of our thoughts on the course, and a dropped participation grade. The grading was pretty fair with good feedback in a reasonable amount of time. It being during COVID and him not being the best with technology plus the class being in person yet most students phoning in through Zoom definitely hurt the experience because of reduced participation, but that is not his fault by any means, and we still had good discussions, just more often with him as the interlocutor than students amongst themselves. I would recommend taking this class in particular and Prof. Smead's in general. Unfortunately, I believe this particular course will only be offered once more, but if you enjoy history or foreign affairs, or have an interest in terrorism or philosophy or sociology, or just want a solid HONR class for the citation, then consider this.

I only missed ONE class and got a B for participation. my grade for the class was an A until ONE missed assignment, which she wouldn't even consider giving me partial credit for, dropped me down.

I thought this class would be interesting and fun but instead, it has made me never want to take another history class again in my life. When the class started on the first day of the semester there were at least 30 kids, by the end of the class I don't, there was 10. This class was so disorganized that we had gone over the same stuff for weeks and the schedule was so messed up by the time the class was done. Her thoughts were never organized and consisted of an unfathomable amount of ""ums"" making the lecture extremely hard to comprehend and made me think personally that she doesn't have a clue on what she is talking about. In the final exam, you're expected to write a four-page essay on the spot (no biggie usually) however she wanted exact sourcing from reading materials on where that information was found. She gave us the essay question beforehand, however, being that we had a lot of reading material we had to do, it is hard to remember specific sources authors and dates. I had never had to do this in my schooling career. If I were a history major, maybe this would be okay but as an elective that allows every major to take, I am baffled at how we had to do that. She is a nice person, and the handful of times I've gone to get extra help have been helpful, however, that doesn't comprehend for the amount of work that has to be put into a class, let alone an elective.",1072

A friend of mine died earlier this year from COOVID and her leniency made a difficult situation bearable. With that being said, I did not enjoy this course in the slightest bit. Every assignment was dreadful. I love history, but they were boring and the fact that every week we were assigned the same exact thing was dull and draining. Every week two zoom meetings, a quiz and a writing assignment. Like clockwork. Nothing was worse than the the zoom meetings where we sat for over an hour and she just read and explained powerpoint slides. It would have been nice if we had different types of assignments. Maybe a group or creative project, making a timeline, more discussion boards( discussion boards are amazing tools, utilize them), a reading that was not 30 pages long, maybe even sprinkle in a kahoot or two. There are so many different types of assignments that could improve this course.

landau,4,A-,,"I thought this class was pretty easy. The class met 2x a week plus 1x with our TA. So the first day Landau lectured on one specific topic, then you would read 1 or 2 documents for homework. The next lecture was someone in that field of expertise. For that Saturday, you would write a 1-2 page paper (double-spaced) connecting the current event to its historical background. The TA is usually really helpful at providing more notes to incorporate into your paper. Each topic was mostly just one week long, while others were two weeks. It was great because if you didn't like a topic you just had to deal with it for a short period of time. I loved the class and Prof. Landau is really helpful during office hours. There is a ten-page paper at the end of the class, and he is generally a generous grader.",1077

Participation in discussion is worth 25% of your grade, so you have to read the assigned newspaper articles, but those aren't long and are usually interesting.

There's no rhyme or reason to the flow of the course... he'll jump from Gambia to Kenya to the Congo within two sentences, and probably cross as many centuries within a lecture.  Go figure, he used to teach at Yale, where students are probably used to his game of intellectual catch-me-if-you-can.  A very rewarding class if you can keep up with him.

On quizzes and exams, even for just simple mistakes, she'll end up taking more points off than each question should even be worth.  By taking he class, you'll be sure to be constantly frustrated by your grade.  The class grade in 302 was so bad, she actually had to curve.   In other words, if you want to get an A, you better be prepared to study your butt off so you don't make any mistakes on your exams or quizzes. ",1086
yamakita,5,B,JAPN201,"I really enjoy Yamakita-sensei's class. She's a personable teacher, but she does keep her home life a little more private than some of the other teachers. 

Her grading can be a little subjective at times (each quiz/test seems to have a random number of total points assigned to it, leading some of the students to believe it's possible to get a negative score). Especially the translations - things that mean exactly (or almost) the same thing in English are wrong if it's not the set formula that she taught. This occasionally leads to sentences that sound really awkward in English. A lot of students were complaining about her kanji quizzes, but I've never had a problem with them. 

The way she presents exams is also a little frustrating because she gives them to us in parts. So we must completely finish part A before we receive part B. This makes pacing impossible because if you're stuck on something difficult, it's not like you can come back to it. Therefore, most people make stupid mistakes on the translation and utilization sections.

I put my grade expected as a B, but it might be an A because I'm literally right on the edge between the two. I think I have an 88 or an 89 right now, but based on my speech presentation, oral interview and final, it could go up. I'll be taking her course next semester as well.",1086

He does not seem to understand the people that are taking this course are NOT taking it to hear about Freudian psychology. Everything is either a womb or a phallus. Seriously. They went into a cave? No they went into a womb. He expects you to either have some psych background or pick it up on the side, while still completing his massive number of readings.

He also expects you to be Christian, with decent knowledge of Bible stories. And into Star Wars. Don't know them? Well then you're going to have to do a bunch of additional work for some of the weekly assignments.

The assignments are all over the place; organization is very much not his thing. He also publishes everything in html pages that are so poorly coded that some browsers cannot open them. Have fun figuring out what the readings actually are through the wall of random text that has the titles and pages included, since he thinks that the return key doesn't exist.

His exams are terrible. There are a list of essays that you have to prep for. Then there is matching from hell and a short answer section that has occasionally super vague questions and you will inevitably run out of time to answer. Then the pictures. There's a whole bunch of random pictures in his slides and html pages, and you need to be able to recognize a tiny grayscale version of them. We complained that it was hard to tell what they were, and he got defensive and yelled at us for making excuses. The quality is often so shitty that you can't pick up on the clues for what it is and just need to memorize the pictures. Oh, despite the fact that spellings of the names vary between the readings, spelling counts.

The class was not too difficult, not too much work, and the tests were fairly easy. However, about 30% of the grade was based on two group projects.

I had him for classics170 as well and he is pretty consistent across the board.  His lectures are interesting but his readings are very long.  He grades fairly but he gives you every opportunity to excel in the material. For our class he set up a notes sharing folder on elms so that everyone posted their notes from one day before and after the midterm so that before the midterm and final notes were available from every class.  This made studying much easier and it was not too painful if you missed a couple of classes like I did.  This class is a lot of work but it is very interesting and worth the time,1105
staley,5,A,CLAS170,"Professor Staley is an excellent professor.  It's definitely not easy and there's a lot of readings but it's really worth it.  You don't have to be majoring in the classics to like this class.  Staley is like a cute little grandpa and I loved him.  He puts so much effort into his presentations and they are perfectly timed, you never get out early or late, always on time.  He tries to make his presentations relatable to the students.  He knows how to keep the students awake and interested.  Two exams throughout the semester and a final.  Two essays due throughout the semester also.  You have to answer about 5 questions weekly, due in discussions, which are mandatory.  Great class overall. ",1105
staley,5,A+,CLAS170,"Not gonna lie, its not an easy Core but its so worth all the work that I put into this class. Staley is a wonderful lecturer, I never missed any lectures. It was something I looked forward too. You don't have to be in love with the classics to appreciate this guy. A lot of readings but if you fall behind a little, wikipedia is always there. But you need to be able to analyze the myths you learn for the test.  He gives the essays that will be on the test and also he gives you all the important names that you need to know. I had a dictionary of classical myth which proved to be very helpful. ",1105
staley,4,C+,CLAS170,"Staley is a great guy and a good professor. He does a good job of presenting the material, and although mythology can get kind of boring at times, with all the readings, he does a good job keeping it at least fairly interesting. Still, this is definitely not an easy A. I had a low B in this class and did poorly on the final, pushing me down to a high C+. There is a lot of reading and if you do all of it, especially when you are supposed to, it makes it a lot easier to follow the lectures, and you'll probably get at least a B. Some aspects of the tests can be difficult though, because there is simply just a large depth of information, and there are usually some pretty specific questions.",1105

staley,5,A,CLAS170,"Dr. Staley is an amazing lecturer and I enjoy coming to class every day.  He obviously puts a lot of effort into making his presentations, and they are well thought out and offer answers to his essay questions.  In fact, most lectures will have the potential essay topic at the beginning, and he will give you answers to the question throughout the lecture.  Each test has 2 essays that come from about 8 that he gave during lectures, so you should have answers and notes for any essay he gives.  The tests also have short answer/multiple choice that comes from notes mostly (some reading) and they are a bit difficult because they usually aren't the big ideas, but include smaller, relatively unimportant characters and places from Greek myth.  For example, you might not see anything specific about Apollo, but you will need to know the name of one of his lovers.  But once you take the first one it will be easy to see how to study, and I did so much better on my second test.  The TA does all the grading so they are very important- James was really great and very interesting in discussion, which is mandatory and part of your grade.  The responses to reading give you easy points to bring up your grade.  Dr. Staley is a wonderful professor and I really recommend his mythology class.",1105

In discussion, he welcomes any and all ideas, but also challenges us to develop them on a deeper level. 
The only thing I’d warn people is that, since the “humanities” is really broad, taking this course requires a lot of personal interpretation and it may seem that you’re going in circles and circles. But it’s definitely manageable.

bremenstuhl,3,A,CPSA100,"Heather is the “main” instructor of a team of instructors for Arts Scholars courses. She is very kind and lively, and she always takes the initiative to reach out to students if she thinks they are struggling. She makes herself very available and is always offering to help students in any way she can. She also has a lot of resources that she shares often to help students academically and emotionally. I really appreciate how much she cares about her students’ success. HOWEVER, the class sessions themselves can be a little pointless. I do enjoy the activities we do. We have a lot of guest speakers in class and we do something very unique every time. I can tell a lot of planning and thought went into planning classes. However, I notice that often when students will tell Heather that something we are trying in class isn’t working great for them, she will kind of shut them down and explain why she’s right and why what we’re doing is important. She isn’t ever rude, but it can be dismissive. The biggest thing I dislike about the course is that it is a 1 credit course, essentially College Park Arts Scholars version of UNIV100. However, we do have a lot of assignments, and I think Heather and her team largely overestimate how much students are willing and/or able to put into a one credit course. I can tell that Arts Scholars is really important to her, and of course it is important to her students too, but I think she is way too serious about it sometimes, to the point where it stresses students out. Additionally, oftentimes when you turn in assignments she’ll take off like half a point for a really petty and minor thing that the student didn’t even realize would've reduced their points, if that makes sense. It bothers me a bit that there is so much emphasis and importance placed on a silly little introduction course.",1115

Sit up front and kiss his butt (laugh at his stupid jokes, keep eye contact when he stares at you, ask two questions every class) if you want him to grade you fairly.

But he doesn't write many things down, so it's good to take notes as he speaks. Like I said he repeats himself often enough that you won't miss the important stuff.
We read some books too, and he explains the chapters well too. 
We have three papers, 3-5 pages each. 
The other part of grades is class participation, so talk. ",1129
bianchini,4,A,HIST331,"Professor: Dr. Bianchini is a very knowledgeable and passionate professor.You can tell she's an expert on the subject matter. She Grades fast and takes no bs when it comes to plagiarism. I never really talked to her personally but she comes off as nice. One thing to note, Bianchini doesn't dramatize her lectures like some history professors do. There's absolutely no theatrics over murders, battles, etc. the class is interesting because the subject matter itself is inherently interesting. 

Course: Personally, the course was relatively easy, considering you take very thorough notes and attend each class. There are email responses which are short essays based off reading material she gives due every week. It is essential you complete all email responses because they make the difference between an A and a B. Also, material from the responses show up on exams. 

Attendance: Attendance isn't required, however there are participation points in each class, so you'll only hurt yourself. The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because she only takes mental notes when someone participates, instead of writing it down. Usually you have contribute two meaningful comments or questions to get a 100. I would do that, but apparently she forgot and would give me a 50% sometime. It is also essential to attend her class because I don't see how it would be possible to pass the exams without attending her class to take notes.

Exams: The exams consist of multiple choice with possibility of extra credit, short answer with possibility of extra credit, short essay questions based off the readings (pick 3 out of 5), and an essay question about the themes of the class (pick 1 out of 2). The exams are not tricky so long as you took good notes, and the extra credit really helps. She gives study guides each class to help you prepare for the exam which contain key terms and dates and they are very helpful.

Overall: Interesting class, great professor, highly recommended.",1131

She's not the world's fastest grader, a fact which she herself admits, but she's very fair.

baron,3,A,HIST235,"She is an interesting teacher and is really nice.  You get two five page essay assignments and two exams.  The essays are analytical reviews on a primary and a secondary source.  Take these paper to the writing center because she doesn't like grammatical errors.  

Her tests are kind of hard because she picks random 25 words and you have to write why they are important in historical times or something like that.  She wasn't really specific on what she wanted on the test, so a lot of people didn't do so well.  But she gave us a generous curve.  She is really a slow grader, she went over our midterm on the last class.  

Also, you have to go to class, take notes, and talk in class to get a good participation grade.  Her power points are only pictures and your notes are based on what she says.

This class was really interesting, so I would recommend it to people who likes this kind of history.

We had to write two 5 page papers during the semester, but I only know my grade on one. She does not utilize Blackboard and takes forever to grade. 

All in all, take this class if you are really interested in the subject and you don't mind getting a B. ",1135

I only skimmed the books before tests to find any information I was missing from my notes. The class has two papers, and a mid term and final.  The final is not cummulative.

Professor Rudy is very nice and has a sincere passion for literature.  I appreciated how he tried to make the atmosphere of the class as laid back and relaxed as possible.  This made it very easy to open up and share ideas to the rest of the class.  I also appreciate how he is willing to accept any and everyone's opinion, regardless of whether or not it agrees with his own.  As a matter of fact, he admitted that he did not agree with an argument I made for one of my papers.  However, he still gave me an A- because he thought I took a compelling stance.  This proves how honest and respectful he is and also shows the amount of integrity he has.  He was always excited to hear our ideas about the readings we had to do in class.  He was very open to everyone else's point of view and was willing to accept our arguments even if he was not previously familiar with them.  Professor Rudy was extremely helpful when I came to his office hours to review my papers.  He was always excited to have me come in and gave me some very useful suggestions that enhanced the quality of my paper.  I will admit that literature is not my favorite subject, and I needed the class to fulfill a core requirement.  However, Professor Rudy made this class A LOT less painful than it could have been.  It was not hard at all and the amount of work given was reasonable.  Once again, he is a fair grader and very passionate about this field.

He assigns quizzes, but they're scheduled on the syllabus and extremely easy if you've done the reading. He requires 5 short responses to poems, and again, as long as you say something smart, you're going to get a good grade. He grades his papers (2 4-5 pages papers) very fairly, and the prompts are very interesting. He actually assigns 3 papers, but you have a choice between the 2nd and 3rd.

At times he can be intimidating, but he is easily the best resource this History department has to offer. An expert in his field and passionate about his work, Professor Herf is no joke. He expects his students to not take information for face value as it is granted to them. He encourages you to question what is presented and demand evidence to support it. I learned a lot not only about Nazi Germany, but about being a more critical historian. Serious history majors; take his class(es)! ",1138

Would definitely take other classes of his. Two books assigned, read neither of them and got a B on the midterm and the two mid-semester 4-5 page papers weren't hard if you paid attention in lecture.

lidz,3,,LING444,"If you do not remember syntax, LING444 will be a challenge in the second part of the semester, either take LING444 right after Syntax I or II or brush up before taking the class.

This class is reading and writing heavy. There are one page reading response papers and longer reading assessments due every week. The final is a paper. There are also 5 short quizzes that essentially checks if you did the readings and if you understood what was talked about. No tests.

Grading scale is very confusing, you never know how you're doing. Everything is graded via the check minus, check, check plus system and it's pretty hard to get a check plus unless you really get the material - no BSing here.

The TA was slow to respond to email and evidently both her and the instructor are a bit slow in that department, according to other students. Don't expect responses over night, will take at least a few days if not more (took me two weeks once). They travel for conferences a lot apparently.

Intellectually challenging, very interesting topics covered but at 9:30 AM can be really dry. Lidz does not post slides, which is a damn shame because they would be SO helpful to ensure understanding. And he tends to breeze through them, so you better be a good note taker.

He is also pretty soft spoken, you might strain to hear what he says and his writing is kind of illegible. I suggest recording his lectures - wish I did.

He expects participation, but will push you if you speak up, so you'll be put on the spot, know what you're talking about.",1139

If you stay on top of the readings and write well, you'll do fine in this class. It's super fun and Professor Grossman always made herself available. I changed my paper topic and did a bunch of random changes to my research paper, but she was willing to help every step of the way. Definitely recommend!",1142

grossman,3,,JWST171,"I have very mixed feelings about Professor Grossman. I think she is nice and the class itself isn't hard. I am just personally not a big fan of her grading methods. The entire course is just weekly response assignments, a research paper, and a final paper. The response assignments are all 120 words where you pick one sentence from the readings and write about it. It's difficult because she wants you to go to deep detail and make connections to other readings but limits you to 120 words and gets mad when you go over. Nothing is ever really good enough for her regarding the response assignments. The research paper is a topic of your choice and it's paced through the semester which I like. The downside is she's very unclear about what she wants for the research paper. She emailed the whole class after we submitted our sample paragraphs saying that most of them were C- material and not once did she think ""hmm maybe I'm the problem instead of the entire class."" In the end, it's not a hard course and it fulfills a lot of credits so I say take it but be prepared to be annoyed by a lot of things. Oh and the structure of the class was full attendance for the lecture on Tuesday and on Thursdays half the class meets for the first 40 minutes and the other half meets for the last 40 minutes for discussion.

mooney,1,B,ENGL393,"DO NOT TAKE HER. I cannot stress this enough. Drop english completely and take it next following semester if you have to. This women is insane. I received a B+ on an in-class writing assignment, where we had to write a set of instructions for people who have never used a shower before, because I did not write ""warning: shower may be slippery!"" She did not have an issue with anything else in my paper...that was her only comment.

You may be thinking ""oh pshh, I did well in AP English in high school, I'm not worried."" I got As in AP english and a 780 on my SATs. This woman does not believe in giving out As. When asked what it takes to get an A, she will tell you that you need to go above and beyond what she puts in the rubrics. Too bad the rubrics are incredibly vague and very unhelpful. You can lose a letter grade for not including something that she never told you to include. 

If you do end up taking her, whenever you go to office hours to ask for help, write down everything that she says. I once went in and she told me not to worry about the page length. I lost points on the final assignment because my page length was off. She forgets everything that she tells you.

The final semester project is not a group project in her class Albeit, it is a shorter project than you have to do in other classes...but it is just as much work. 

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She gives out way too much work and you will get lower grades than you deserve. ",1147
mooney,1,B+,ENGL393,"
Avoid this  instructor at all costs. She literally has NO teaching qualifications, and the major part of her career consists of writing articles for the auto industry.  There are many assignments, including 2 presentations, 3 memos, an individual final project, and lots of little assignments in between. Oh and you have to attend every class because she keeps track of attendance and participation (10% of you final grade).  Expect harsh grading, she will knock you a 1-2 letter grades down for ""poor formatting"" on an IN-CLASS writing assignment, despite having excellent content. Comments on returned assignments are not helpful, leading you to make the same mistakes again. Sometimes she just tells you to visit the writing center, instead of providing useful advice on how to improve your writing. 
As you can see by her stats, Mooney believes that everyone should get a B, and doesn't explain how to get an A.  With no teaching ability whatsoever, she stands at the front of the class and informs you of upcoming assignments for 50 minutes. Once in a while, there is assigned reading, in-class writing assignments, or poorly explained grammar exercises. For some reason, she gives out a ton of paperwork in addition to posting assignments on elms. Towards the end of the semester, there are a LOT of due dates one after another, so it becomes very difficult to keep up with the work.  More than half of your grade is determined in the last ~4 weeks, with 3 drafts for your final project, an oral presentation and 2 memos.
Overall, this class was way too much work. And I definitely have not improved my writing skills at all.",1147

horty,5,A+,PHIL370,"literally the greatest professor I've ever had. super understanding of student concerns, he will happily reschedule an exam if people don't feel prepared for it and want to review for an extra day or 2. His exams are simply a subset of the review questions that he hands out, meaning that a week or so prior to the exam, he will give you a practice exam, and then the actual exam will be selected questions from the practice exam (taken word-for-word). He just wants you to learn, not get tricked by an exam. Even though the class is an hour and 15 minutes, the exams take no longer than 20 minutes if you really know the material.

But one thing I would like to stress to anyone thinking about taking this course is that you should have some interest in music from around the world b/c unfortunately in lecture I did sometimes sit near people who would make extremely rude and immature comments about the music and videos we had in lecture. 
Your grade is basically based on the tests and papers, all of which are very easy. The tests are straightforward information form lecture, i hardly took notes in lecture and did fine. I wouldn't waste money on buying the CDs or book because neither were necessary. 
Lucky for me my TA's english wasn't the best, so she didn't grade our papers on grammar :)",1152

My father saw us on zoom and heard a snippet of class, and was shocked and amused with how he stated subjective things as fact in such an arrogant manner. I feel like I will do well in his class, but he is an annoying teacher to have- not someone I would want to know in a personal or professional setting. And he does love talking about himself.",1153
naharro-calderon,2,B+,SPAN333,"Oh dear lord. If you respect yourself, I wouldn't take this course. It's not that I'm doing badly; it's the fact that I really don't feel like this professor respects his students. 

He is, admittedly, a great lecturer. He knows exactly what he is talking about, and he will give you that information. His class is interesting, he is not boring, and I have no doubt that he is knowledgeable about his subject. He is even quite funny at times.

However, his class structure is such a clusterfuck that I can't advise anyone to take this course. He is routinely late to class by at least 3 minutes, and he routinely holds the entire class after by 5-10 minutes. I have had him keep a class 13 minutes after the class had officially ended, just because he wasn't ready to stop talking.

His syllabus is horrific. It is 16 pages long, single spaced, and extremely unclear. It liberally intersperses random bold and italicized words. It is nigh impossible to tell the difference between an assigned book and an assigned movie on his calendar. The whole thing is about 2 days off of what we're actually doing in the class. The due date for the final paper is not even on the thing, and he couldn't tell us until two weeks before finals when it would actually be due.

When our class asked him what would be on our first exam, he would not tell us. It might be reasonable if he had something on the syllabus about it, or if he just gave us some broad topics that would be most explored. However, he just answered ""Everything."" He said everything would be on the exam. Supremely unhelpful. He also would not tell us the format of the exam. If you're not okay with not knowing anything about the test you're about to take, don't take his class.

I have received multiple grades from him that i have NO idea how I got. His grading is mysterious, to say the least. His writing is illegible, so there's no way to read his comments without going to his office hours. I have no idea what he's looking for as far as tests, essay, and quiz answers... even after having taken the class.

To top it all off, he is a huge luddite. I've seen him yell curse words at a computer before. If something goes wrong, he blames it on technology. He got mad at our class for not knowing the name of a specific brand of typewriters, because it was the title of a poem and he thought we would all get the reference instead of being massively confused. He refuses to stream films from Hornbake library onto Canvas because he says he wants us to get the film experience. This means you have to physically travel to the library to watch every movie for his class (where you watch the films on a TV screen that's probably smaller than your laptop or desktop screen... film experience). He makes frequent comments about how something is very wrong with 'your generation' because students today like technology. 

You cannot use any technology in his class, even for any of the books, papers, or films that are assigned. You must buy every book and print out every reading. I went through a full ink cartridge just from his class. If you take this class, make sure you have a laser printer.

His exams are not hard, but they are comprised entirely of essays and he does give pop quizzes. If you managed to slog through the syllabus to find what you were supposed to do for that day, and you managed to choose the right day and the right work for that day (because it may well not be on track with the syllabus) AND you found the reading or bought the right edition of the book or went to the library to do the assignment, then his quizzes are easy. The final essay at the end of the course was 5-8 pages long. 

I would avoid taking this class with him if you can. He knows what he's doing, and I like him as a lecturer, but his arrogance about technology, his awful syllabus, the heaps of assignments, and his general lack of respect for his student's time make me wish I had been able to drop and take this with someone who at least pretended that they cared about their students as people.

As a last note: If you are weird like I am, you will notice that when he has talked for about 15 minutes, his saliva starts to froth around the edges of his mouth. He rarely wipes it away. I'm super uncomfortable with things like that, and I have literally gagged in class before. Sometimes I just stare at my notes and avoid looking up. If that would bother you too, be warned.",1156

If you never do any other work for the class, which is very possible because he gives very little homework that is actually due, keep up with the new vocab. The quizzes and tests always have a couple sections on vocab and it's an easy way to get points. Whereas after 3 semesters of learning the same verb tenses, you either know them or you don't. He tries to call on everyone in class once a day, so if you pay enough attention to be able to answer correctly when he calls on you, you can do other stuff the rest of the time. 204 is when I get my homework for other classes done.",1158

falvo,4,,ITAL204,"I'm an Italian Language minor, so this class was pretty easy for me, considering it was a complete review of everything we learned in 103 and 203.

I give the other people credit who actually did the work, especially the ones who struggled through the class, simply because it just didn't come that easy to them or some other reason.

That being said, Falvo is an awesome professor. He usually comes to class 5 minutes late (on average), doesn't speak a mile a minute so he's easy to understand. A couple days during class we would bring in cookies and stuff and make espresso in class.

Normally they're no more than 6 to 10 pages a week. However there may be a reading many orders of magnitude longer, although she will give you more time to get the reading done or will be more lenient on the material she tests.

Now the bad: He's an evil grader. He literally never gives higher than an A- and only 2% of his students even get that much. I wanted a 4.0 for this semester and this class ruined my chance at that, otherwise I would have gotten it. I worked like hell for this class too, I spent six hours just editing some of my papers, I don't even know how long I spent writing them. Like I said before the homework is also excessive, it helps for the most part and most of it ties into the bigger assignments but there's way more than any other section gets. When you have four other classes it's hard to fit in that much extra stuff, even if they're smaller assignments. I'm a bio major, I want to focus most on my other classes more related to my major but this class takes up so much time. Even if I didn't do A level work, I know some of the other people in my class definitely did. It's just plain mean to outright not give anything above an A-.

In summary: If you really need to get better at writing and you're not too worried about your gpa, this is a good class. But otherwise stay far away from it, it's far too much work for little pay off. ",1170
lohr,4,B+,ENGL101H,"Take Lohr if you are looking for: an exciting English class that allows you to follow your interests in-depth and become a truly better writer. You will feel like you learned a lot about writing and improved tremendously over the course of the semester.

Don't take this class if you are looking for: An easy A and a manageable workload. Lohr is a harsh grader (w/ justification given for why he takes points off always) that demands a lot in his assignments. Lots of essential reading to do every week and the big projects take serious time to do well. 

Overall, it depends on what you are looking for. If you have the attitude of wanting to learn over getting a 4.0 GPA, then Lohr is your guy - the class, I am confident, will help in the long-term much more than any other ENGL101 class. ",1170
lohr,5,A,ENGL101H,"Lohr was by far the best and most caring English teacher I have ever had. Granted, his class had a significant amount of more work than other sections had, but the work rarely ever seemed completely pointless. In other words, just about every single assignment he gives is geared to hone your skills in a specific area of writing. His lectures are always crystal clear, and he covers all the main points in the reading out of Engagements for each class. 
Also, he is so helpful in his office hours and is very generous in the amount of time he gives up to help students - you can even email him over the weekend and he'd get back to you in no time. He basically handed me my ideas for my final two papers.
Finally, he has some of the best character traits I have ever seen. Not only is he very nice and respectful in class, but he also responds to joking and side topics very positively - to a reasonable extent, of course. And his mannerisms are always entertaining, to the point where it becomes fun to joke about what a character he is outside of class with other classmates.
Finally, he reads every single word of your papers and is always willing to write comments in the margins, sometimes even stretching from the top to the bottom of the page. And his love notes at the end are always pleasant, following the format: ""Dear ---, thank you for submitting this draft. In it, you....Work on these skills in future projects. I look forward to reading them"".

Overall, great guy, great teacher, great class. I highly recommend him.

Oh, and PS: He does grade fairly harshly, but it is very manageable to get a high grade in the class as long as you put in a fair amount of effort. Don't let that 2% A distribution scare you away.",1170
lohr,4,B-,ENGL101H,"Lohr made me like Englich class.  All throughout high school I hated English so much and had an awful foundation in writing, etc.  Lohr made the class so engaged and current that I actually (for the first time ever) looked forward to going to English.  He is a bit of a tough grader, but it was Honors; that's to be expected.  I definitely could have put forth more effort than I did, but I feel that I got the grade I deserved.  Lohr is an amazing professor, and is very approachable.  I highly recommend him to anyone in the Honors College!",1170
lohr,4,A-,ENGL101H,"Lohr's class was more difficult than most writing courses I've taken in the past, but he made it generally pleasant.  While he graded somewhat harshly, I was more driven to put significant effort into my essays, and I think my writing improved as a result.

Interestingly, he never particularly cared about the tiny details of formatting or citations, nor was he particularly harsh regarding style.  He graded essays mostly based on their content and arrangement, rather than anything else.

Overall, he kept class fairly interesting.  When I'm next forced to take a writing class, I'll try to find one that he teaches.",1170
lohr,4,B,ENGL101H,"Lohr is a great teacher. You will learn a lot and improve your writing. I felt like he was the only professor who cared about teaching me the entire semester. 

That being said, he is a harsh grader. Do not expect an A unless you are Shakespeare. 

I would recommend him for improving your writing and a pretty worthwhile class, but not for raising your GPA. ",1170
lohr,5,A,ENGL101,"The good stuff:
One of the wisest and knowledgeable professors I've had. Really cares about his subject and cares that his students learn and grow as writers. He is always willing to help and will always work with you to improve your writing skills and confidence. I learned more about writing in his class than any other English class. Really nice and respectful guy. Also cracks some funny jokes in class too.

The not so good stuff:
He is a tough grader. This is because his standards are high and expects good work from his students. It makes sense because he puts in lots of effort to teaching and expects the same from his students. He gives more homework than the average ENGL 101 professor but it's mostly readings I never bothered to read.

Advice:
If you work hard, show him you care, and don't procrastinate - you will get the grade you want.",1170

The only thing I would suggest is that, during the beginning of the class, we had barely any work for about a month to 2 months. However, for the last month and a half, we had a major assignment due every 2 weeks. She is a very relaxed grader, so just make sure you follow her directions. I highly recommend taking her, this class was a very relaxed business writing class that did not require a lot of work, and I received an A.",1173

cresap,3,,ENGL393,"As nice as Cresap was trying to be, it was extremely difficult trying to understand what he’d want from us for any assignment. There’s no rubric, no sense of organization, along with the fact that you don’t know your grade unless you email or ask in person. I’m taking his course that was originally in person, now online due to the pandemic, and this situation goes to show that he’s truly not for online teaching. He took feedback on his spamming us with ELMs announcements (and us struggling to find what assignments were due that day within those 10+ announcements) and he minimized the amount and made them a bit more organized by listing everything due that day under one announcement. That was the only upside to this class. Otherwise, his critiques on my final drafts, although they should be helpful, I don’t read them because there’s no incentive for us to redo our papers when those are the final grades anyways. Whatever paper you edited after your peer review and submit to him the following week is the final draft you get graded on. He gives no direct feedback to your draft until it’s graded, so you just have to hope you magically wrote an A paper. Your grade relies on you knowing what he wants without him explicitly telling you, and hoping that the peer review somewhat helps you, and at the end only to get a nice B- for an assignment you thought you put a decent amount of effort on. I thought I could enjoy his class and get something out of it but it’s the most useless class I’ve taken. He’s also pretty good at responding fairly quickly to emails. If you’re looking for an easy A or some class to ease up your schedule a bit, I don’t recommend taking it with Cresap.",1180
cresap,1,,ENGL393,"Please avoid taking ENGL393 with Cresap!! There is no rubric at all, and you will not know your grade unless you ask him or estimate based on your previous assignments. He asked us to fill out a mid-semester course evaluation and lots of students put that we wanted a rubric so we know what he expects for each assignment. However, he told us that ""he doesn't believe in rubrics"", so essentially it's just hoping that he likes your paper enough for it to be an A (which was a very slim chance after talking to other people in my class). The only chunk of feedback you can get is from peer reviews, but still they are unhelpful since they also don't know what he expects. The only perk to this class was that he lists out all things expected within the ELMS announcements, but there are a lot so you need to keep track of them. He might be helpful to take if you are a junior because of the resume and cover letter assignments. I am a senior, and he graded mine poorly (even though I got hired at a top company with both!!) just because it didn't meet his standard of the outdated textbook. If you'd like transparency in your grading and helpful feedback to actually learn professional writing, avoid him at all costs.",1180

akikawa,4,,JAPN102,"I had her for JAPN102, and she was cool.  Her personality is a bit serious, so you may not have as much fun as in other Japanese classes, but her grading is *very very* reasonable!  She's also very cool if you talk to her outside of class.  You may feel a bit pressured in her ACT classes, because she usually makes you(and your partner) perform in front of the whole class instead of being able to do it from your seat.  She will also cut you off if you didn't memorize the CC well enough, or get nervous, but she will give you a chance to re-do it usually. Like I said though, her grading is very reasonable, so you most likely won't have to worry if you take some time to prepare.  You can tell she tries to make things fun sometimes, but she's very serious about her work so she can come off as a bit strict/serious compared to Seya or Inoue.  Overall she's cool,  and definitely fun to talk to outside of class. If your class is lively and energetic, she'll loosen up a bit as well.",1189

She once told someone that theyre acting like a high schooler because they read the syllabus wrong and did the incorrect reading, and thats just the beginning of how rude she really is. There have been several other instances where shes called people out in front of the class for doing something incorrectly. Telling them they did the wrong thing isnt a big deal but the fact that she does it in front of the class makes her one of the most appallingly impolite teachers I have ever had.",1192

The subjects covered in the course can get a little dry at times but Demaria manages to keep your attention.  She does not lecture with powerpoints and such, but mostly uses class discussion to highlight important points needed for the exam.  She does expect everyone to come prepared to every class and doesn't do well with people who slack.  Through my experience, she has given a pop quiz or 2 because students didn't read the assigned materials.",1192

3.	 His instruction are very unclear, there were some cases where he didn’t even know what he assigned in the last class. 
4.	For the content courses, his tests are completely unrelated to the topic. His test seem to be a gauge of how fast you can read and write, with very little emphasis on the content that was discussed in the class, his test are more like proficiency exams.

Japanese is a ridiculously hard language, and frankly, if people ***** about the grading in 101, they have no place to continue forward. Yes, it is a 6 credit class, and yes, you have to put tons of time into it. Don't take out all your frustration on Inoue-sensei. She is a very hard grader, but she's extremely approachable outside of class and she will help you. Yes, ACT is difficult. I remember those days and it was kind of nerve-wracking. You just have to stick with it if you really want to learn and excel. An 89.2 -> B+. Believe me, I wasn't happy about that when I finished 101. Oh well, sucked it up, finished 302, and went to study abroad in Japan (best way to improve your language skills). Oh, and taking Japanese as an engineering student was fun. So yeah, Inoue-sensei is definitely one of the nicest people I've met, but yes, she was a really tough grader. Just so you know, though, ALL Japanese teachers at UMD are hard graders.",1210

If you're prepared to work your butt off, and believe me, you will work VERY hard, then this course and teacher combination is for you. BUT you would probably learn the same amount (with less stress) with another teacher.

I'm giving Inoue a 2 because I feel that she was much more strict than she had to be. I would personally never take Inoue again for the following reasons:

1. She rarely takes the time to help you correct and improve on your mistakes.
2. She offers little partial credit and does not recognize when you are ""trying""

Inoue-sensei wants you to read, write, and (especially) speak well so she will correct you when you make errors. Simple as that. Devote at least 15-30 mins a day to studying and you will be fine.

Also, her tests and quizzes are pretty fair. She'll tell you exactly what to expect on each assessment and grades them fairly. She does not unfairly deduct points.

Overall, she's a strict but fair teacher who uses a very engaging approach to teaching. She's very personable, so classes are never boring. You will walk out of class fully understanding what was covered.

Look at her A percentage on UMD. 18% for 101? That means, out of all the sections she's ever taught, less than ten people have gotten A's. Well, if you want to massacre your GPA, go ahead. 

In my class of 15, there was probably about one person who got an A. ",1210

There are 6 homeworks, 2 of which are basically papers and a bit ridiculous. The other homeworks are just linguistics problems and are very easy.

forrester,5,A,ENGL391H,"These 5 star reviews are no joke. Take this class. It's probably the best version of junior English available.

It's a class for all majors, but I seriously found it useful, even as a science major. Forrester makes it super bearable, is one of the nicest teachers I've had at UMD, and has a sense of humor. Loved taking this class. The only regret I had is that all of the writing assignments coincided with my exam days (just my luck) - but one time he even pushed back a due date to Wednesday because several people in my bio class had an exam that Monday. SUCHHH a nice guy.

He's kind of picky/particular, but he gives a ton of helpful feedback. And as long as you fix exactly what he tells you to, he gives you an A on rewrites.

You have to put in work, but it really wasn't too bad. I never went to office hours or spent too long on papers (whoops) and still got B+'s and A's on my papers. A's on papers are hard to get, but A's in the class are handed out generously, so don't be discouraged if you get like a B on 3 papers or something - DO THE REWRITES THOUGH.

You have to have some interest in the humanities (movies, literature, history, languages, etc.) to truly appreciate the class, but overall his grading is fair and he's committed to making sure your writing is the best it can be.

You'll learn how to write more concisely and how to sustain an argument through a long paper, as well as how to write a resume, cover letter, grad school app essay/personal statement, etc.",1217

The class isn't easy, but you will learn so much if you actually put in the work and try to do well on the papers.  Take advantage of the rewrites, and DEFINITELY go to his office hours.  I think that's the main reason I got an A, is because I went to his office hours repeatedly for help, and to ask questions on how I could improve.

Forrester is a great teacher who takes time to connect with his students, and is always available for extra help.  He is a tough grader, but gives re-writes where you can usually get an A just by changing exactly what he said was wrong on the original.  All in all, a great professor for a course that most of us would not take if we had a choice.",1217

I'm SO glad I took the honors version of this class-i can't imagine it was harder than the regular version, and since it's such a group-based course, having other honors kids was clutch. Forrester is picky about grammar, formatting, etc, but that's what the class is about and you learn a ton about professional writing. Absolutely would recommend this class!",1217

forrester,5,A-,ENGL391H,"I would definitely recommend taking Junior English with Professor Forrester. He is, however, a tough grader, so I recommend editing/reviewing any of the papers before turning it in. Certain little things (like font serif/color) could cost you valuable brownie points.  
The resume/cover letter workshop is extremely helpful, and because it is in the beginning of the year, it will definitely help you as you search for jobs/internships during fall semester. 
There are also a series of papers that feeds into a larger proposal. However, you can choose the topic as well as your partners, so make sure you choose something you're genuinely interested about!

He is invested in his students and in English, and he is always more than willing to help you perform to the best of your ability in his class. And he does learn your name quickly and is personable.  All-around great guy, great class...he tends not to give A's on assignments that often, but I like him so much that I can't hold that against him! Would highly recommend taking this class with him for your Junior English. ",1217
forrester,4,B,ENGL391,"The class expectations are outlined extremely well in his syllabus. Just do the work and you'll get the grade you expect.

forrester,4,A,ENGL391,"I really enjoyed this class. You have to do a career portfolio, which includes a cover letter, a resume, and a personal statement, which can come in really handy for graduate programs. The rest of the course is devoted to coming up and writing about with a proposal to a problem that you could help solve. 

He expects good work, but doesn't set the bar so high that it's impossible. You can tell that he enjoys teaching English and that he knows what he's talking about. He's super nice, learns your name very fast, and is readily available if you need to get in touch with him. ",1217
forrester,5,A,ENGL398L,"I was expecting to hate my professional writing class, but it was one of the best classes I've taken. There are a couple of big assignments due throughout the semester leading up to the final paper. The paper can be about anything you want, and he grades fairly for all the assignments. He also allows rewrites for a couple of them, but as long as you put in some effort you shouldn't have to do the rewrites. The highest grade he gives is a 95% but for final grades, a 92% is an A. ",1217
forrester,5,A+,ENGL391,"Best English professor ever. Assignments are reasonable and enough time is given to finish them. He doesn't grade harshly either and wants you to succeed. He realizes everyone is a junior/senior and that we're lazy so he actually makes class fun and not stressful. All assignments are connected and are about the same topic. They lead up to the final paper which combines all the work you already did throughout the semester. Most papers aren't more than two pages, last paper is around 10. He's not strict about page or word count either. Haven't gotten below a 95% on anything",1217

I attended close to every lecture, took thoughtful notes, and submitted assignments on time. In a separate course in the same semester, I earned A's and B's on papers. In Marsha's class, I was lucky to get a C, and with four assignment's throughout the semester, that does not leave much room for improvement. I took the class as an elective, hoping to expand my Jewish learning and to embrace Jewish history in America. Instead, I received my lowest grade in my undergraduate career. And this is coming from someone who has taken intro Biology and Chemistry.",1218
gensheimer,5,A,ARTH200,"As a CMSC major with no interest in the arts whatsoever, this class was actually pretty interesting. Great lecturer, always kept me engaged in class. She dimmers the lights so that you can read the slides easier (which I personally like) but a few of my friends said that it made it hard for them to take notes so keep that in mind. Tests were extremely fair. If you pay attention in class, you should be able do well on exams without much extra work. You can also do well on the exams without being extremely intuitive / knowledgeable about art and symbolism. My only complaints for this class were that the textbook was required (I managed to go through the entire semester and get an A without reading one of the ""required"" reading assignments) and the discussions are kind of boring, but also required as they check attendance.",1224
gensheimer,4,A-,ARTH200,"Dr. Gensheimer is a well-informed, organized, consistent professor. However, lectures tend to be pretty dry, and the dim lights in her room are pretty annoying when you're trying to stay awake.

I had this class the first time the DCC program began, when the program didn't really know what path it was going on.

I took this class online in the fall 2020. there are weekly quizzes that are very easy and you can have the reading up next to you. the discussion is annoying but isnt that long so it isnt that bad but you have to show up to get attendance points. The midterm and final are both so easy as long as you take notes and watch the lectures. the averages were a 94 and 95. the final paper is annoying so I suggest meeting with the TA because they are the one grading it and not the professor if you have questions. Overall, a good class!",1227

The asynchronous nature of the class made it a bit impersonal, but you could tell he was sad about this too and really wants a personal connection with his students.

Suriano is very friendly and accommodating to his students. The class is only based on a few assignments, quizzes, and exams, but all are fair and not too much work. Only complaint I have about this specific course was that it was crosslisted as a history course, despite not really being about history but moreso about archaeology (Professor Suriano's field, not history). Despite not expecting the course to be structured like that, Professor Suriano has great lectures and made me interested in the material despite that. Highly recommend taking any of his courses if you're remotely interested in the subject(s).",1227

kong,5,,CHIN203,"Kong is a solid teacher- I took two semesters of Chinese with her, and deliberately chose the sections she was teaching. 
Her best asset is the genuine desire for her students to learn the language.
If you take the time to participate, and even visit her office hours (she works hard to make herself available for help), you will get a lot out of her classes.
Unfortunately, I did not get to be as involved as I really wanted to be due to my major classes dividing my attention. Regardless, I learned a lot with her teaching. She wants to challenge students, but she is by no means unreasonable or unfair- there's typically consistent homework and weekly quizzes, along with a midterm and final. 
A very kind and understanding person as well, though she can seem shy or uncertain of herself at times. Patient too- we'd often make the same mistakes or errors, but she'd never hang it over our heads- she'd just correct us and continue onward.

To my understanding, her one pet peeve is her students not trying- so if the class has been slacking, she can get frustrated/angry, but that's only understandable for an instructor. 

If you really want to learn Chinese, I highly recommend her!",1233
kong,5,A,CHIN411,"As I am studying for her final right now, I can't help thinking how much I have learned from this class. it's probably the most important class I'll ever take in my college career. 

I am an Economics and Finance double major who signed up for this class by random luck (nothing else fit my schedule). I couldn't have gotten luckier with the professor. She is very understanding and in a 12 people class, it's hard not to participate and develop a strong relationship with her. A great teacher to ask for a recommendation letter from as well. 

There was one midterm and one final, together contributing to 40% of your grade. The other 60% come from homework, class contribution (so come to class), and vocab quizzes (give you several words in Chinese from the textbook chapter and you have to write the pinyin and translate), and a group project. An important part of the her class is outside required reading - a short news article about some business in China. Most of them were pretty interesting and since they are current news, they force you to stay in touch with what's happening in the business world. 

If you are a business major and you have the language ability to take this class, do it. Your resume will thank you later. ",1233
kong,5,A,CHIN205,"Professor Kong is the only Chinese professor i've had thus far. I took both 205 and 305 with her and she is amazing. 

The class is definitely a significant amount of work because there are two quizzes per week, one character quiz, one pin yin/chinese to english quiz.

if you are 205 you will also be graded on character sheets (a grade booster imo).

there are two exams: a midterm and a final. the exams are exactly what you covered in terms of sentence structures and vocabulary. the key is keeping up with the vocab. if you have time don't just memorize the vocab for that week, go back and rewrite old vocab. for anyone who's ever taken chinese, you should know that characters and hard to memorize and easy to forget. 
given that the exams are always cumulative, it is imperative you keep up with the vocab because its impossible to cram 1000+ characters the night before the final.

there are also oral presentations which she grades very easily as long as you try. 

the only downside is that she does assign essays (2-3) and they are quite tedious. if your parents are chinese, have them look over it. otherwise, go to her before they are due and have her read them over. she usually grades the essays rather hard, so make sure you're grammar is correct. for essays she only awards A's for analysis on the topic and original ideas. think of it as an english essay. don't slack. you will be penalized.

overall
keep up with the work. i cannot stress this enough. chinese is something learned over time, not something that can be crammed overnight.
Kong is an incredibly nice woman and will help you if you need it.

Don't expect to be called on much if you're not in Olmert's little club of followers who have already taken a class with him. Also, for the tests, he basically expects you to memorize dates, names, and ESPECIALLY his ideas. Admittedly, he knows the time period and its literature very well, but that's no reason to quash individual interpretation of the works.

I received better grade on all assignment than my classmate and she received an A and I received a C and yes we are from different nationalities!!!If you don't believe me you be the judge yourself!!But if you can avoid him at all costs!!In fact he needs to be FIRED!!!,1242
winett,2,,ENGL398E,"Pretty terrible and the class did nothing to improve my ""professional writing"". Takes months to grade your assignments and when you get it back it has very little feedback on the actual quality of the paper...all he does is grade on grammar and comma usage. He takes off points from your participation grade if you send him emails in the wrong format. Seriously. I felt like I was in the 6th grade again or something. Also the grade distribution here is not accurate whatsoever alot of the class ended up with C's",1242
winett,1,,ENGL392,"I am pretty sure he is one of the worst professor's that I have had. Finals have just started and I honestly have no idea what grade I will be getting in this class. He does NOT give assignments back in a timely manner and when he does give them back his grading is absurd. I sincerely wish that I had not taken ENGL392 with him. Even if I get an A, I will still agree that he is a horrible teacher. ",1242
winett,1,A,ENGL398E,"Winett is by far the worst professor I have had at Maryland.  Since it is an English class, attendance is mandatory (and boy is it painful).  Most of his classes consist of him half-heartedly going over the assignments and then talking about nothing for the rest of the class.  He is extremely meek and soft spoken.  He is also very indirect when asking people to do things.  He has an extremely specific way of sending him emails and assignments and if you don't follow his format perfectly, you get points off, which is ridiculous.

At the beginning of the year, he said he would focus on the content of your writing, not the grammar or little mistakes.  HOW WRONG THIS IS.  In all of the assignments, he took off for the small things such as missed commas or a misspelled word.  This leads me to my next point.  Out of the 6 assignments in the class, we only got the grades back from 2 of them before the class ended.  How are we supposed to know where to improve if we have no feedback?

The class consisted of 6 assignments.

The first assignment was a rhetorical analysis of a paper that you had written prior to the class.  Let me start by saying Winett is obsessed with these rhetorical analyses.  I believe they are some of the most pointless assignments I have done in my 3 years at Maryland.  They are hard to explain without you seeing them, but they are basically just restating what the purpose of the original assignment is.

The second assignment is an analysis of a peer-reviewed journal article.  Luckily, the article doesn't have to be about economics and can be about anything.  This assignment wasn't that bad.  Basically, it was just an analysis of the different parts of a journal article based on the criteria that Winett created.

The third assignment was a planning memo.  This was another one of those stupid rhetorical analysis papers.  This time, it was related to the final paper, which I will get to in a little bit.

The fourth assignment was a resume and cover letter.  I thought this would be easy because I already had a resume and cover letter that had gotten me multiple interviews and offers with some of the biggest names on Wall St and in the accounting world, but in all actuality, it was completely different than what I thought.  I had a resume and cover letter based on the templates provided by the Office of Career Services at the business school.  However, this was not sufficient for Winett.  Unless our job experience was directly related to the job we were applying for, Winett wanted us to delete our work experience and instead put in statements of what we had done in our classes.  For the last 3 years, I have been taught to NEVER EVER do that because everyone takes the same classes and does the same thing.  I have been taught that any work experience is good to put on the resume because it shows you can hold a job and can ultimately relate to a different job (ie. restaurant job = experience in a fast paced environment, working with deadlines, etc).  Also, we had to do a stupid rhetorical analysis for our resume and cover letter too, which was again completely pointless.

The fifth assignment was a persuasive presentation.  It might as well have been any kind of presentation you want, because ultimately Winett didn't give two shits about what you talked about as long as you gave the audience an ""experience"".  I honestly think Winett didn't care if it was persuasive or not.  Every time we talked about the presentations in class, he always talked about giving the audience an ""experience"", but never about how to persuade the audience.  Most of the presentations ended up being informative presentations about some hobby that the student was interested in, but he seemed to love them because they got the audience involved and gave them an ""experience"".  Don't forget, we had to write a freaking rhetorical analysis for this too.

Last but not least, the sixth assignment was a journal document.  This meant we were to write an article that would be published in an undergraduate peer-reviewed journal.  This is the biggest assignment of the course, and he spent forever talking about it.  However when he talked about it, he never really said anything useful.  This project was such a pain.  Of course, lest you forget, we had to write a rhetorical analysis for this too.

Overall, DO NOT EVER TAKE A COURSE WITH WINETT.  He is a terrible professor.  The assignments are totally pointless.  This class sucked.",1242
winett,3,A+,ENGL393,"Yeah this guy will definitely make you want to kill yourself when you listen to him talk for long enough. 

The class itself was actually really straight forward, and I found it to be very easy overall especially for a summer class. I would have given him a higher rating but I am sitting here, it is the last week of the class, we have had 4/5 assignments, and I have no idea how I am doing. He only returned grades for the first assignment, and then he just flaked off. 

Overall a really nice guy though, I'd definitely recommend 110 percent for technical writing. Easy!",1242
winett,1,A,ENGL392,"Horrible professor, at an intellectual and professional level. It's true that it's easy to get a good grade but he is also inconsistent with his grading (It is obvious he doesn't put any effort into grading). He makes things unclear and unnecessarily boring, and is not ashamed to be blatantly ignorant about the subjects he teaches. By far worst professor I've had at UMD. Take someone else if you care to learn something. If you want an easy A, just know you'll be miserable for three hours a week .",1242
winett,3,A,ENGL398E,"He changed the content of the course.  Often, his expectations were unclear and students were frequently confused about what he wanted.  He was willing to help clear things up though.

He doesn't teach that much about writing itself, more about rhetoric.

He required that the major semester paper be published in a journal.  For a undergrade, this can be very difficult.

Overall, he's a nice guy and he grades pretty leniently.  Now that he has taught 398E, he may have a better feel for it in the future.",1242
winett,5,A,,"cakewalk professor.  he's a weird guy, but he lets you re-write papers for higher grades after going over it with you step by step.  if you take advantage of this, youre almost guaranteed an A or B.  I'm a decent writer at best and know next to nothing about law and i got an A- in legal writing.  the final project is the most important thing, make sure he likes what youre doing and do a good job at it and you'll end up with an A without a doubt.  

if possible, take your professional writing class with winett, you won't regret it, instant gpa booster",1242
winett,1,,ENGL393,"Although this professor gives the majority of his students good grades, as far as I am concerned he is a disgrace to the english staff.  He gave me a bad grade in his class for no reason.  According to his grading scale, I am in his bottom 3%  As far as I am concerned, he is a horrible person and a horrible grader and should be removed from teaching at the english department because he contributed to the lowering of my gpa!

dolbilov,3,B,HIST237,"Dolbilov is ok. He has a noticeable accent, but it's understandable. He stutters a lot. The class itself is your basic survey course of Russian History, so you namely hit the highlight leaders and revolts. There's a lot of reading to do.

dolbilov,1,A-,HIST419P,"i dont know what the other reviews are talking about but this might be one of the worst professors in umd. he doesn't seem to care much about the topic or just simply can't explain it in a understandable way. he stands in front of a powerpoint, which consists of a picture, and talks. lectures are useless and some people fall asleep. it is true, however, that he grades relatively easy. but this was one of the worst classes i've ever taken",1245
dolbilov,5,A,HIST419P,"He makes class pretty interesting, but if you don't do the readings, you'll have no idea what's going on in class.

That being said, he's a reasonably easy grader, especially on the term paper.

boutla,5,A+,ENGL393,"A STEM perspective on Boutla's 393 class:

Dr Boutla does not teach this class like other professors. The review on this page from 2019 is pretty on-the-mark by claiming that her class is basically just an entrepreneurship writing course. That's not a bad thing. Allow me to elucidate.

I took tech writing with Dr Boutla in Fall 2019. My peers in aerospace engineering are taking 393 now (Spring 2020) with other professors, so I have a decent data set to compare with.

With most instructors, English 393 is a horrible class. The papers are long, tedious, pointless, joyless trash that will leave you more confused and agitated than anything, and the biggest assignments always seem to line up with the parts of the semester when you should be studying for exams for your major courses. I've had multiple peers miss several days of exam study to write pointless dreck like ""annotated bibliographies"" and impossibly detailed peer reviews. All to have the teacher give them a middling grade with copy-pasted feedback.

Dr Boutla does none of that. She approaches the class from a goal-oriented perspective, challenging students to consider the professional path they most wish to pursue and tailoring their assignments to that end. She gives a handful of reasonable assignments throughout the semester and grades fairly. It is easy to get full credit on every assignment as long as you meet the posted requirements. My class had to do the following:

- Resume and cover letter (write, and rewrite based on instructor feedback)
- Industry paper (Write about the field and companies you intend to work for, focusing on a key industry issue)
- Slide deck/Presentation (Prepare a powerpoint based on your industry paper, present it, and answer questions from your peers)
- Some in-class participation exercises

These are all reasonable assignments that mostly teach useful skills. Dr Boutla's lectures are laced with premium professional advice whether you're interested in grad school or employment post-grad. She's a neuroscientist and professional career coach which makes her highly qualified to discuss the course content, and I believe she's genuinely invested in her students' success. Also, she's just a very nice person.

I strongly recommend Dr Boutla's section. I would even go as far as recommending shuffling your schedule around to get into it if necessary/possible. The horror stories from your peers in traditional 393 sections should be enough to prove you made the right choice.",1251
hijazi,5,A,ENGL101,"Great professor. Really enjoyed her class this semester.  I took the blended learning version of her class. 4 or 5 major papers throughout the semester and I knew exactly what was expected for the assignment. There are weekly assignments online, but they are very simple, just tedious. Not many people in my class participated, so it was easy to get points. 

Be sure to see Mrs. Hijazi during her office hours to receive extra help with assignments. Go to the writing center! She is an assistant director and it means a lot to her... 

I got an A+ in the class... Just be sure to act like you care in class, do what is asked of you, and improve in your writing throughout the semester! 

Take Hijazi!",1252
hijazi,5,B+,ENGL101,"She is a really great professor. If you try hard, she's going to see that and appreciate it. Extremely hard, but she expects you to take your writing seriously as you should. A is never a guarantee so if you're looking for an easy teacher, switch to another class. ",1252

The open source textbook is also really bad at explaining the material. If you get a good TA, you actually might do well enough, but if not, discussion is almost not worth it. Class time itself was a disaster, midterms had to get pushed three times, and material had to be cut from the final, which would not have helped, as the class average on tests uncurved was either a D or a C. He does curve tests like 10-15 percent, but I consider myself lucky from scraping something adequate.

cote,5,A+,ENGL280,"one of the nicest professors I've had. his expectations are very reasonable and his exams aren't made to trick you -- he says this himself. Though I took this class to fulfill a gen ed requirement, I'd definitely take more classes with him if I was more interested in English.

For 280, the structure with him worked like this:
4(!) exams
1 final
1 paper proposal
4 homework assignments
5 online discussions

the midterms come quick, but they aren't hard. They're basically half multiple choice (super common sense questions, too), and half short answer or fill in the blank.

The final he was nice enough to make online as he figured it would help people do better on it, and openly said to feel free to use your notes or any other resource.

The paper proposal was his way of bringing some form of writing into the class, as this is a class on the history/structure of English rather than a literature or film class. We basically had to choose a topic that we talked about in class and think of a thesis that we could argue. We only had to write an abstract, and then also have two sources which we wrote an annotated bibliography for. Again, not hard at all.

The homeworks were essentially mini exams, honestly. Super easy and he would sometimes hint at what some of the answers were. The problems were super similar to things that we did in class, so there were no surprises.

The online discussions were kind of annoying, but not difficult. We had to write discussion posts on ELMS that were sometimes way too long for what the topic was (250 words for something that you can talk about in 3 sentences) so a lot of it ended up being fluff. Not hard, but kind of stupid.

Overall this class was a 5/5 for me, especially with Cote.",1267

carruthers,4,A,PHIL209N,"He is a really nice and cool professor and the class is pretty easy for most of the semester. There is one midterm exam and one final exam which isnt too bad because the questions are posted before hand and you go over some practice ones in class too. Each week you have 2 readings to read that are usually about 10 pages each. They can get kind of long so i usually end up skimming, but everything is really interesting, definitely more of a psych class. Each week you have one quiz on lecture notes and on the readings for that week, just by going to class and skimming the readings i dont think i ever got lower than a B on the quizzes, and he curves them at the end. The only part about this class that sucks is the group project. It has to be 4000-5000 words and can be hard to write if you have a bad group. But overall the course was really interesting and relatively easy.",1271
carruthers,3,,PHIL209N,"The lectures are interesting but the quizzes are have a lot of trick questions, plus we don't get them back so it can be hard to know exactly what you missed in the readings. Which brings me to my next point, there are two papers you are expected to read a week which can be very long and very dense. Also this class is listed as a philosophy course, but it's more of a psych course. The test questions are released before hand, which is helpful. There is also a group project that is worth a large portion of your grade.",1271
carruthers,5,A,PHIL209N,I really really loved taking Phil209N with Carruthers.  He is truly a brilliant man and I'm astounded by the books and papers he has published.  I've even cited them in BSCI papers that I've done.  Some of the topics can seem obvious and dry but a lot of his lectures are truly amazing and can't help but capture your intrigue.  There's a quiz every week on usually VERY long empirical readings.  Even though I've read these types of papers for my science courses I still found it difficult.  The exams are not difficult as long as you don't slack off a lot.  There was also a group paper to write which was incredible annoying.  But as a professor he is very approachable and fair and does a brilliant job at presenting his material.  And he has an awesome accent,1271
carruthers,4,A,PHIL209N,"An excellent professor. Carruthers is one of the best in the field of philosophy of mind, and though he does not have a background in psychology, he does a great job of explaining findings in cognitive psychology and thinking about them critically. I'm a psyc major and I learned more psychology in this class than I did in many of my other psyc classes. The one downside for this class is the group project. I had a bad one and the papers are graded harshly. But I was still able to pull off an A by doing well on the quizzes and in-class exams. Overall I would recommend this course.",1271
carruthers,5,A,,"This guy is awesome. He's brilliant and lucid. It doesn't hurt that he's one of the leaders in field. He's calm and prepared in every class, fields questions like a pro, and is never condescending (even when he probably should be).

The class is amazing. It's the perfect progression of interesting, relevant papers to make you feel like you've truly understood the main contemporary issues.

That said, this class (Phil482) was HARD. It explores pretty nascent philosophy that you can't exactly look up on wikipedia yet, so it's super important to go to class and read the papers. Don't be afraid to ask him questions at all, because he'll go out of his way to explain things in a different way.

This was probably the best, most interesting philosophy class I've ever taken. If Carruthers offers another upper level class, I'm definitely going to take it.",1271
carruthers,5,A,PHIL140,"Professor Carruthers is seriously the best. He puts all of his slides online but they can be a little confusing if you don't go to class, plus he's just an awesome lecturer. He's British, which is awesome, and he explains things really clearly. There are 3 debates that you have to do in addition to a 7 page (2000 word) paper. The final is 40% of your grade, but  he gives you the questions beforehand. It's not that hard of a class but it is REALLY interesting and I always left with something to think about. Also, I got a lot better at arguing. 

I would definitely, DEFINITELY recommend this class",1271
carruthers,4,A,PHIL209N,"This is really a psych course about decision making. The content is pretty cool and interesting. Carruthers himself is a pretty good lecturer. The class is on the easier side. Each week there is a little reading and quiz in discussion. Besides for that there is a midterm that is basically a few essay questions. You are given different options of prompts beforehand and then you have to answer a subset of those prompts at the midterm. The final is the same format. They grade the exams pretty leniently. The averages when I took the class were in the high 80's. The big assignment in the class is the group paper, which has to be 4000-5000 words. They walk you through the assignment but your experience with it depends on your group. Overall, it was a good class and I'd recommend if the topic interests you.",1271
carruthers,4,A,PHIL202,"PHIL202 is the same as 209, pretty sure. Like everyone was saying, it's a lot more of a psyc class than Phil, but there was still a lot of interesting course material that was really cool to learn.
I had this class over zoom and it was done asynchronously. Each week, he posted a 10 minute video of him introducing the topic, and then two slide shows which taught the topics of the week. Fridays we had a discussion section with the TA.
Here are my thoughts on that: I really wish he would have posted video lectures instead of slide shows. The 10 minute weekly video was always very nice. It was entertaining and intelligent, and I felt myself engaged. The slide shows, though they were very interesting, were not engaging. I found myself always just doing a whole week's worth of material Thursday night before taking the weekly quiz. I think I would have gained so much more from the class if it were done through video lectures, even asynchronously.
Still, overall I found him to be a solid teacher.",1271
carruthers,5,A,PHIL202,"Prof. Carruthers was an enjoyable lecturer and made the class enjoyable, I also had a great TA so that helps. The course content is fascinating and the amount of work is very manageable and the expectations are very clear. Most of the course decisions are founded on some empirical finding, which is nice and kinda cool. The biggest downside was having to read the PowerPoint lectures, I wish they could have been presented verbally. Overall, this was one of the most interesting courses I've taken at UMD and Prof. Carruthers was a big part of that even with the limited interactions.",1271
wien,3,A,,"Wein is incredibly knowledge about the Middle East. However, he is not very effective at communicating his knowledge. His lectures are very long winded and often go over time. Expect to do a lot of reading in this course. A fair but tough grader. ",1273
witte,5,A,ENGL101,I took this class over summer session 2. He's a pretty easy grader and seemed like a cool guy.,1274
witte,5,A,ENGL398A,"I really enjoyed this class, probably because Peter was such a great professor. He's super understanding, outlines assignments in a really thorough and helpful way, and conducts peer review so that everyone gets both positive and constructive feedback. I definitely recommend taking this class, especially if you're an artist or enjoy interested in art.",1274
kosicki,5,A,HIST113,"first of all, kosicki is honestly one of the kindest people i've ever met in my entire life - and towards the end of the year when he told the class that he was canadian, everything made sense. but yeah easy course and i still learned a lot ",1275
kosicki,5,A,HIST419B,"I had Professor Kosicki for both HIST419B and HIST113. He is a really kind person and really cares about his students. He is also very passionate about the class, as well. For both of these classes, the assignments/quizzes/exams were always fair and covered things that were gone over in class. ",1275

scully,4,A+,ARTT110,"Took this course online and found her to be a great teacher! She is a nice, caring and very easy-going teacher. Most of the work she gives are just drawing projects and gives you so much time to complete, whether within class or outside. My only critique is she tends to spend a lot of time during class going over each project, explaining every little detail which made exhausted me having to listen for a long period of time. Other than that, I would definitely take this class again. ",1278
singpurwalla,5,,PHIL414,"Dr. Singpurwalla is probably the best Philosophy lecturer in the department. She really knows Aristotle (and other Ancient Greek Philosophy) well and her lectures prove this. Does a fantastic job teaching material objectively while keeping the class engaged. 

She may actually hold the most difficult teaching job on campus -- facilitating undergraduate students on their quest for 'eudaimonia.'

Dr. Singpurwalla genuinely wants to see students succeed. She is transparent with her grading system. If you want an A: attend all lectures, 
read the required text multiple times, review study guide questions, and start paper(s) early!",1282
singpurwalla,5,,PHIL414,"Phenomenal teacher. Professor Singpurwalla knows her stuff. She explains everything very well and encourages a lot of discussion. I like that we focused on reading one text in great detail.

I also visited her office hours and received helpful feedback on my paper topic and on the review sheet for the exam. 

Definitely recommend her and Aristotle.",1282
singpurwalla,5,A,PHIL414,"Professor Singpurwalla is the nicest professor in the philosophy department- very approachable and understanding. When someone says something stupid in class, she doesn't mock them or move on, she tries to understand and incorporate it into her point. 
Logistics- we studied Nicomachean Ethics- two exams, each covered half of the work. One paper that she makes you do an in class peer review on which is actually extremely helpful. Random reading quizzes (I think 7 during the semester) but you can drop your worst one and they are really easy to answer. She reviews all the time and her exams are directly from what she emphasizes in class. She really knows what she's talking about but lectures in an accessible and easy manner. Refreshing for an upper level PHIL course.",1282
singpurwalla,5,A,PHIL310,"Professor Singpurwalla was amazing. There are very few professors that not only know their stuff, but are actually good at teaching it. She is one of them. She explains the material in such a thorough way that there is no way NOT to understand. She also reviews at the beginning of the next class so if you're not there, you can know what you missed, but if you were there its a nice reminder. If any effort is put into the class, and you know how to write, you will get a good grade. ",1282
singpurwalla,5,A,PHIL209E,"The course is discussion-based and attendance to discussions is mandatory. They have quizzes at the beginning of each discussion so if you are late, you miss the quiz, which is 20% of your grade. There are two exams, a midterm and a final, which are easy as long as you memorize the answer to the study guide they give you. There is one essay for the class and its graded somewhat easy because its graded for content and not how well you can write an English paper. Mostly an easy A as long as you take notes in class or get them from someone who went to class. You can get away with not reading the book if you show up to class.",1282
waugh,5,A,ENGL101,"Professor Waugh is a great choice for ENGL101. Her class was half online/in-person, which was really nice schedule-wise; the class ran pretty similarly to other ENGL101 classes (pacing), and the grading was relatively fair. I think the main plus about the class was Professor Waugh. She's always very pleasant and is willing to meet and talk with students about any issues in class. She was very understanding during the coronavirus pandemic and adjusted the class schedule to lighten the course load for her students. You honestly cannot go wrong with taking her course!",1283
waugh,5,A,ENGL498,"I have had her for both ENGL352 half in person-half online, and ENGL498 all online. Out of the professors I've had for workshop so far, she is the best. We get ample time to discuss each other's work and the workload is reasonable. She is responsive to student concerns and grading is easy. 

On the subjective side, she seems to really understand your writing and doesn't shy away from telling you what you should be doing differently. Her humor is great as well.",1283
ontiveros,5,,ENGL301,"Great great teacher! I will admit at first I signed up for his class because he had the highest percentage of A's AND best reviews, but after the first essay, you find that he has made his engl301 class more difficult. It really is not an easy A. After my first submission, I was sorely tempted to drop the class, but he promised to teach us a lot, so I stuck with it. Best decision ever. He taught me so much in one semester and made it seem as though the grade really wasn't important. If a teacher can make students care more about learning than what they got in the class, then that's just amazing. I highly recommend this class! By the end, you will have improved your writing and come out still loving English. ",1288
ontiveros,5,,ENGL301,"Ontiveros is a fantastic teacher. Be warned, though, he has made his 301 class a bit more difficult, so don't expect an easy A (the grade breakdown is therefore inaccurate, as he will warn the students on the first day of this.) I still don't regret taking this class (even though I might not get an A) just because I have learned a great deal about writing from him. He's super knowledgeable and a great teacher. ",1288
ontiveros,5,,ENGL437,"I loved this class and LOVED Ontiveros.  He picked great texts, taught them incredibly well, and he is just an insanely intelligent, friendly, AWESOME guy.  One of my favorite classes I've taken at UMD.",1288
ontiveros,5,A,ENGL301,"Professor Ontiveros is by far one of the best professors i have had at UMD. He seriously cares about his students, and LOVES when people come to office hours. In the Literary subculture, I have found that many people take themselves too seriously and would rather hide behind a facade of intelligence than actually explain the things they think and believe -- Ontiveros is everything BUT that. He never tries to intimidate students, and seems to really love what he teaches. That said, 301 being a gateway course, he couldn't take that much liberty with the curriculum... but when he could, he did (making literary comparisons to Eminem and The Hills... unheard of, but AWESOME). Take any class with him you can, I absolutely plan on it.",1288
ontiveros,5,A,ENGL479F,"No one's reviewed Dr. Ontiveros yet!? Wow, he's a really good professor. He does everything he can to make the course inclusive by refraining from use of jargon, making grades a secondary concern, and encouraging discussion. ""Literature of the Chicano Movement"" is definitely one of my favorite courses at UMD. It was a real eye-opener and shifted my English concentration from Shakespeare Studies to Latino/a Studies. Ontiveros is the man. ",1288
ontiveros,5,A+,HHUM105,"Dr. Ontiveros is absolutely wonderful, and one of the nicest, most approachable, and most understanding professors you can get. This was his first semester as a part of Hohum, and I think he did a great job. Hhum105 can be a lot of work, but none of it is particularly difficult. Dr. Ontiveros actually restructured the course partway through the semester to make it easier on us, and occasionally would cancel/postpone readings or assignments to lessen our work load. The only downside to this class was the reading. The main textbook  is very dense and drags on a lot. There are also many supplemental readings throughout the semester, but as long as you just push through them you're good. Other than that, hhum105 was a lot of fun, and people were always willing to participate and discuss in class. There are a couple of smaller projects and then one big capstone at the end of the semester, which counts as the final, and they are only as hard as you make them. The grading was super easy, so as long as you turn things in on time, you'll probably get an A.",1288
ontiveros,4,A+,HHUM105,"The class was pretty easy. The material was pretty interesting, but there was very little order to it. He often just kinda had assignments that were pretty random and didn't have to do much with the course itself. It seemed a lot like just having an assignment so that we don't ever not have an assignment.",1288
ontiveros,5,A,HHUM105,"Awesome professor! He obviously cares about his students and about the course material. He offered to take students out to lunch and just talk about life, which is a really cool way to make a connection especially during online learning. 
The class itself is not too difficult, and as long as you do the work and keep up with the readings (so that you can speak up in class) you should be fine. Love Dr. Onitveros, and if you have a chance to take one of his classes before you graduate do it!",1288
ontiveros,5,A,ENGL142,Professor Ontiveros is amazing! He really cares about his students and is just so open and honest that it's refreshing compared to other professors who act like their the only ones with busy lives. I also just loved the ENGL142 course but I definitely believe that it is Ontiveros who made it so interesting and engaging. I 100% recommend taking any course he teaches!,1288
ontiveros,5,A+,ENGL142,"When I tell you that this guy is the goat I MEAN IT! Overall a wonderful Gen Ed to take if you are looking for an i-series. His class was really chill and I learned a lot more about maryland history and its iconic characters than I originally thought I would. He also includes a lot of discussion time in his class which makes it very easy to stay engaged. There is a pretty big capstone project at the end of the semester, however, he is very very lenient with what you do with it and he's very encouraging with that whole process. 10/10 Randy is the man.",1288
mazzone,5,A,COMM424,Nice guy. His lectures are pretty interesting. He's young and has some cool stories to tell. Pretty relaxed class just STUDY for the tests because they are pretty tricky and do all the participation work.,1289
mazzone,5,A+,COMM107,"I took this class online and it was super easy. We had some reading quizzes and a few speeches. The speeches were recorded and turned in via video. We had an introductory speech, an information speech, a revised informational speech, a persuasive speech, and a special occasion speech. The final was another speech about what we learned and improved on throughout the class. The professor was very understanding and during the winter semester when I went on vacation and one of my hotels had bad wifi he let me turn in my assignment a day late without any points taken off. 

Overall hes a very nice guy and I highly recommend anyone who is struggling with public speaking to take the online version if you are uncomfortable with the classroom version ",1289
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,"If you're taking this for gen ed you might feel like the topics have nothing to do with anything, but try paying attention and see if you don't learn something really interesting. Worst case scenario you'll learn something to say on a date that will make you seem halfway cultured. 

The lectures are dense with information, but once you get used to the flow, you will get a lot out of them. 

For art majors, you must take this class with Prof. Weil. 

",1290
weil_rex,1,C,ARTT150,"This class is undoubtedly the MOST BORING POINTLESS CLASS EVERRRR. 

First of all, he makes you purchase a special edition textbook that HE specifically created with his ""quotable quotes"" so that if you don't have the text, you either have to spend the $90 to get it, or just try to skim by without it. There's no alternative.

Secondly, in lecture he may be knowledgable but I wouldn't know it because he speaks so slow and in a boring tone, it's a real struggle not to just zone out. 

I ended up hardly ever attending class just because every time I went it just seemed like a true waste of my time. His quizzes in discussion are easy, but only if you've read the text. He gives out two 2 hour midterms which are very ""words-used-in-the-text"" based. He wants you to say exactly what is in the text. It's annoying. 

He also requires you to take 2 trips to DC and take selfies in front of 20 different paintings/sculpture that he specifically picked out. 


tl;dr
This is the worst class I've ever taken, just because it is SO FRIGGIN BORRRINGGGG. 
On a lighter note, if you are a person who enjoys debating about an art piece for weeks on end and never really coming to any conclusion, you'll like this class a lot.",1290
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,"Professor Weil was an extremely knowledgeable lecturer. He had a great, dry sense of humor that kept the subject matter interesting so that it felt more like a conversation rather than a lecture. His grading was fair, and as long as you take notes, you'll be golden for the quizzes and tests, for he rarely asks in depth questions regarding the texts; it's more overarching themes. Overall, I very much enjoyed this class and suggest it. ",1290
weil_rex,5,A+,ARTT150,"Let me start out with ""TAKE THIS GUY'S CLASS."" It's easy, it's interesting, it's enlightening, and it just may change your life. Do the reading, go to class, and go to discussion. There is so much extra credit you'd be a fool to not get AT LEAST a B (I got an A+, easily). Now, the deets.

Rex is absolutely delightful. His penchant for turtlenecks and oval eyeglasses, his shaved head and pursing of the lips, his snarky and pretentious yet non-intimidating way of explaining things is exactly what I would have wanted from an art professor. (I urge you to youtube ""Sprockets SNL"" but imagine an American if you want a preview of what I'm talking about.) I signed up for this class because it filled one of my CORE requirements. I was not expecting much, but I know the things I learned in this course will continue to benefit me throughout the rest of my life.

I came into this class having no formal training in art, philosophy, or art appreciation. I left feeling like I had a baseline understanding in all fields, and with a passion to learn more. I have always enjoyed going to museums (there are two museum assignments in this course; go and enjoy the free museums of DC! This is a luxury!), but when on outings with  more artsy friends I was without the vocabulary or historical context to contribute meaningfully to our conversations. Now, I feel like an art boss. And you can, too.

This class isn't about memorization, but without going to lecture it is (very hard to get full credit, attendance is mandatory) and hard to digest the readings unless you pore over them. Rex's explanations and summaries are crucial to understanding the material and enjoying the course. The exams focus on broadish facts, but there are essay questions that ask the test taker to elaborate on the themes of each writer. As long as you explain what you're doing with an informed modicum of intelligence you will do well.

So, in closing, do you like art? Do you need a CORE? Are you an art major? Have you always loved art but felt deficient in your conversations with ""art"" friends in the context of your own life or in historical context? If you ANY any of these things, take this class. It changed my life for the better, and it might change yours.",1290
weil_rex,4,,ARTT150,"Prof. Weil's Art Theory class was definitely interesting. This class is very lecture-based and you must do the readings on time in order to do well. Some of the readings are more difficult to understand, but he is very good at explaining meaning and letting the class know what we need to focus on and remember. If you come to class, discussion, and do the readings accordingly, you should have no problem earning a A or a B.",1290
weil_rex,5,,ARTT150,"Intelligent and funny, Prof. Weil is by far, the best! Rex’s teaching style builds on these attributes, as he gradually proceeds to make a dense subject thoroughly interesting, easily digestible, and thought provoking. The sensitivity displayed to his students is unparalleled, as he is always available to assist you, either after class, office hours, or via e-mail. Trust me on this one folks – don’t miss this class – it will have a lasting impact.",1290
weil_rex,3,B+,ENST411,"Dr. Weil is a merciless and pitiless grader who takes off points for anything and everything.  And with 100% of your grade coming from 3 exams and 1 paper, every single point counts.  Also, he lectures with the lights off and offers few chances for student participation, which makes this class a real snoozer.
Otherwise, the content is actually extremely interesting and Dr. Weil is a fascinating man with a lot to say and some great stories.",1290
weil_rex,5,B-,ARTT150,"The course packet can be intimidating at first, but if you do the assigned readings, go to class and actually listen to what he is saying, you will do fine with minimal studying. Take care not to fall behind though, because the packet is quite difficult to pore through on your own due to its volume as well as some of the unfamiliar language that is used.

As for Professor Weil, he is very chill and his manner of speaking is likewise. It may be too chill for some who can get lost in his droning rhetoric, but I appreciated it because it gave me time to jot down notes and often write down what he was saying word-for-word if it seemed super important. He's got a great sense of humor, doesn't take the material too seriously and is also very understanding. I had an unfortunate situation where I missed a LOT of class throughout the second week of the semester but he was nice enough to not completely annihilate my grade as per the course policy. He makes himself available despite his busy schedule to answer questions, administer make-ups and tend to other official business such as nailing you if you use the Internet on your art gallery assignments. Overall great class, great guy. Take art theory with him and you won't regret it.",1290
weil_rex,4,B,ARTT150,Weil is a great teacher and keeps the lecture interesting with his humor. I don't regret taking the class even with the monster size course packet. All the topics and people we went over in class constantly comes up in ALL of the classes I have now and I'm sure will appear in the future.,1290
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,A wonderful course. Professor Weil is a phenomenal teacher. He never condescends and is extremely understanding. I recommend this class for anyone looking  to expand their aesthetic consciousness or for anyone who just wants to understand art a little better. ,1290
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,Professor Rex is a wonderful professor. Class is quite boring but discussions help tie to together the concepts. Its good to at least try to read and then wait for him to review everything at some point to drill the information in. The 2 museum assignments arent too bad at all. ,1290
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,"Rex is the best professor I have had so far. He is funny and interesting. I love his sense of humor and his exams were easy. The class has a lot of required reading and the reading is dense, but he goes through it in lecture to really help you understand. I highly recommend taking this course.",1290
weil_rex,3,a,ARTT150,"This course is incredibly boring. You will be expected to go to 2 museums in DC and do extensive reports on them. the midterm was 2 parts & closed book. 

Prof. Weil is a very nice guy but he talks very slowly and it is very easy to space out and not listen at all. If you enjoy debating the definition of ""art"" for 15 weeks, then you will be a happy camper. ",1290
weil_rex,5,A+,ARTT150,"I got an A+ in this class. Before taking the class, I did not think it would be a very interesting class just by the name ""Art theory"", but it actually was very interesting. At times you may not understand the reading assignments for homework but, Prof. weil does a great job of going over the reading. DEF go to the lectures otherwise you will fail this class. I got a A+ in this class, I did well on the exams, not so well on the quizzes. And he gives up to 8% extra credit, hard class if you don't pay attention and do your work, easy class if you do. PS at times class may seem a little boring but it actually is more of a philosopy class than it is art",1290
weil_rex,5,A,ARTT150,"Definitely one of my favorite professors at UMD so far. I don't think everyone got his sense of humor, but his dry, subtle remarks were hilarious. He's really into old school rap. You should go to class because the reading is hard to understand without Rex going over it in lecture. ",1290
weil_rex,4,,ARTT150,"He is a really good professor, although sometimes his monotone voice put me to sleep.  He's a pretty cool guy, gives lots of extra credit, open book/note exams, etc.  It's a reallly easy A.  You'll like it if you're into philosophy.",1290
weil_rex,4,A,ARTT150,"Boring class, but he lets you use your notes on the tests so you cant complain about that. Real easy. Gives out extra credit alot so go to class. I think perfect attendance gives you an extra 5% at the end of the semester so it really helps your grade",1290

ianozi,3,A-,GERM204,"I saw all the positive reviews, and thought this is probably how most of my classmates see/saw her. But I didn't have the same experience. She hated me, like I felt like she decided to pick on one student at random to hate for the semester and I was the ""lucky"" one. None of my classmates understood why either. She was very reluctant to teach me and often would not. I also found that I learned more from the text book and going to tutoring hours than I ever learned or could learned from her. Sometimes it was cool and she would bring us treats and once we went outside. But sometimes her teaching was very unethical. Also beware she will try and change you to a German major if not a minor at all cost, I feel like she gets a bonus of something for it. Her grading wasn't that bad, it was harsh but fair. Don't expect any sympathy or much understanding from her though and she will never coddle you. Which isn't a bad thing, but she isn't a warm or friendly person. Overall you will probably get along with her well enough after some adjustment, unless you are the ""lucky"" one then good luck, you will need it. If you are just coming into 204 without any previous German classes at UMD don't expect her to be understanding and willing to teach you things because she will just say you should have learned it in a previous class, but the tutoring hours with the TAs help with it. ",1291
ianozi,5,A,,Excellent at her job.  Highly recommend.  Language classes can be such a hodgepodge of students.  She is great at keeping everyone engaged and focused.,1291
ianozi,5,,GERM302,"I took several classes with Regina and would highly recommend her as a teacher. She clearly has a passion for teaching, which makes all the difference when engaging people at varying ability levels simultaneously.   

Regina is extremely personable and is very good at keeping students interested in the material. This was accomplished by fostering a very open environment, in which all students were highly encouraged to participate. This classroom experience allowed for a constant exchange of ideas and different perspectives. 

If you are willing to put the effort in and genuinely want to learn, then you will definitely enjoy any class with Regina.      ",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM302,"I had German 302 and German 204 with Regina in 2011, and made extraordinary progress during this time thanks to her teaching. Today, two years later, I use the language professionally. We had fascinating reading material, got an excellent overview of German literary history, and had every opportunity to expand our knowledge of the language.

As several commenters below have mentioned, she is quite good at managing a class with students on varying German levels so that no one is bored or completely lost. You'll notice that the only negative commenters are people who haven't mastered English; perhaps language learning wasn't their calling. You should take her classes if you are truly interested in learning the language, not if you're just lazily checking boxes on the  way to graduation, because you will really be expected to apply yourself. The effort pays dividends, and is also be a genuine enjoyment.",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM204,"Regina is a good teacher! I took several German courses before. She is one of my favor, even what she taught me was actually something boring -- german grammar. So when I signed up GERM204, I thought it would be very boring at the beginning. But in fact, you will learn stuffs other than just grammar: german history, fairy tale, music, etc. You will also see she has well prepared for the topics she teach you in class.
Regina did have a high standard for students, but that’s because she want you to challenge yourself. She would patiently pick up your mistakes in your writing assignment. That’s because she wants you to learn from your mistakes. Frankly, her reviews on my writing assignments helped me become more confident in writing german.
Regina is fair in grading. She will talk with each student personally after the midterm exam. Tell you what to do to improve your grading. I think she is a good teacher!",1291
ianozi,5,A,,"Regina is a very knowledgeable and passionate person who very obviously loves her subject and is an expert at teaching it. She gets openly excited about certain topics in class and her excitement is contagious. She also goes great lengths to make sure she is always available to give extra help or a few words of advice. 

Know though that while she is absolutely fair, she does expect you to apply yourself in class. You'll have to earn your grade whether you're fluent or can barely pronounce Scheiße. On that note though, she does take into account your current level, not punishing those that arn't quite as far, but are doing their best and not letting those that are quite good just glide by. 

Also, as a side note, Regina's background just makes her more awesome. She speaks at least three languages fluently and is truly a global citizen who's seen quite a lot. A fascinating woman and a great teacher, take Regina for the course or at least get to know her. You won't regret it.",1291
ianozi,5,B,,"Regina is a great teacher- I'm very surprised to see negative reviews. First of all, although her ethnicity should be irrelevant, I thought her background really benefited the class because she provided some really interesting perspectives about what it was like to grow up in a Soviet state, which is definitely important to understand if you want to fully understand modern German history. 
She tries so hard to make sure everyone understands the material. There was definitely a wide range of language abilities in the class and she did her best to make sure everyone was accommodated. I wish every teacher were more like her. ",1291
ianozi,5,A,,"I took two courses with Regina, GERM322 and German 302. Regina does have high standards for her students, but I must say Regina is very concerned about her students understanding of the material and will always make time if a student requests it. If I had a question or didn't understand a concept, she would always help me. Her lectures are never boring and you can tell she enjoys teaching. They are well researched and she made them interesting. She also has a great sense of humor and is a very happy person (which makes going to class fun). I am shocked to read the negative reviews since they personally attack her. They could not be farther from the truth and I sense jealously behind them. In sum, I would highly recommend taking a course with Regina! ",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM302,"Regina was one of the best German teachers I ever had.  She spoke and taught German extremely well and was truly passionate about all of her subject material.  The German literature she chose was always interesting to read, and she was really good at being available for office hours or after class for extra help.  Class participation is very important to her because she wants to make sure people are really learning and comprehending the material.  Her classes are not easy, expect to earn your grade!  But there is no reason you shouldn't be able to succeed if you put in the effort.  Also it just needs to be said that the fact that she is Russian is irrelevant and the idea that she hates Germans is honestly crazy.",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM302,"Regina is a great teacher. She has a firm handle on the material and high expectations for her students. She is very nice and open to feedback, and she grades fairly. She also has a strong passion for the language, which shines through in her lessons. I took both 302 and 322 with Regina, so I got to see her teaching both a Conversation and Composition class and a Literature class. 

The best thing about Regina was that she pushed me to potential when I honestly wasn't working as hard as I could have been in the literature. She encouraged me to put more effort into class preparation and studying, and it really paid off for me. I feel like it was a lesson I needed at the time, and my German improved as a direct result. I wish other teachers had pushed me similarly!

You do need to come prepared to class (when don't you?), but what you need to have is spelled out in her syllabus. Overall I was glad to take Regina's classes and they helped prepare me for studying abroad.",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM204,"Regina is a great teacher for anyone to have, and it is shocking to me to find negative reviews for her on this site.  She was one of the nicest teachers I've had in any of my classes here: always understanding of circumstances, willing to help with any problems you have, and fair with regard to what she expects out of the class.

When I had her for 322, it was plain that there were a few people in the class on a higher proficiency level in German than others, but she worked around that very well .  Yes, she does expect the basics - attendance, attention, participation, and work/reading to be done before class - but she is not harsh about it and when you don't have the fully-correct answer to a question at first asking, she will help try to guide you to the answer if it looks like you have the idea.  Even at the times where our class was not-so-good and hadn't done our reading or work as asked, she remained remarkably patient with us.

The German department at UMD is stocked full of great TAs and professors, and Regina is definitely one of them.",1291
ianozi,1,,GERM302,"Well, Regina is a very incompetent teacher. I know her well (former classmate of mine). She sure doesn't know what she is talking about and I am shocked that she is really teaching. I remember several classes with her. Fact is, that she is very nervous because she doesn't know her teaching material well. I am sorry to say this, but I don't really think that you guys will learn intense enough. Yes, she is not German she is Russian and honestly I really don't understand why she is teaching German knowing that she shows hatred toward the German nation. She can be very nice, but I don't think that this characteristic will help you in your studies. Sorry, that I can't give any positive annotations. ",1291
ianozi,5,,GERM203,"Germ203 is by no means an easy class, but for those interested in the German language it will be a lot of fun. The grammar and vocabulary you learn is incredibly useful.  Asking for directions, checking in at a hotel and even current events are just some of the topics you will learn. 
I took the class during the summer, it was  2 hours a day for 4 days a week for 6 weeks. It was more of a German203 bootcamp rather than a class, but it was truly the most fun I have had in any class. I also learned so much in a very short amount of time. The amount of work was a lot, but once you get used to the workload it made learning the material much easier. 
Regina Ianozi was a great professor and made the 2+ hours everyday fun and interactive. The small class size made it an excellent learning environment.  I was honestly sad when the class was over, it was truly a great experience. 
I highly recommend taking this class, especially during the summer, if you are interested in German or need a language class. It is an interesting language that is quite similar to English. The class teaches useful things that anyone interested in visiting or living in a german-speaking country could most definitely use. ",1291
ianozi,4,B+,GERM204,"Regina is a sweet person. She just can't always convey the more difficult topics in a way we will understand them, like passive voice or challenging modal sentence constructions. My class was good at participating, so she liked us. She does expect you to know the chapter's material and vocab before class, so be prepared and do the relevant homework beforehand. She always told us when we would have quizzes, and we always knew what to expect on the tests. She took exercises straight from the book! I never could finish the essay part of the tests due to time, so know the chapters well to breeze through the exercises. I'm really shocked to get a B+, considering she never posts anything on elms, but she is a fair, even lenient grader. ",1291
ianozi,3,C,GERM204,"I found Ina to be unhelpful. We had quizzes almost every day, and she would expect us to come in knowing the material for the new chapters. Her tests were too long for us to finish on time, and while she gave us extra time, it was stressful to have to rush. I did poorly on both tests, despite understanding the topics, and doing well on the homework and in-class exercises. She is open to suggestions though, and wants us to do well, so it's like she just doesn't know how to properly teach us grammar, or prepare us for her exams. Hopefully, she will ease up on us by the end of the semester, because most of us are struggling in what should not be a horribly difficult class. ",1291
ianozi,5,A,GERM302,"A truly professional and nice teacher, but does have high expectations when it comes to being punctual and prepared for class. Tests are usually easy and she grades fairly. ",1291
ianozi,1,,GERM302,"HORRIBLE TEACHER! Firstly, shes not even a professor, she's just a TA that has too much power and little teaching skills to be giving grades. She is so insecure about her teaching skills. She stutters so much b/c she is nervous and then gets angry at the class if you dont participate. She doesnt know what she is talking about, and is very biased towards Germans. Its like she doesnt like them, but yet teaches a GERM class. (oh btw she is not german).Then she doesnt tell you what is due for homework until two days before it is due. NO organized syllabus! She would email the class on Sunday night what was due for homework on the folowing Tuesday. Also, she would extend class 10-15mins every day cause she never kept track of time. Totally selfish, like ppl dont have more classes than hers. Then the lecture consists of her reading from a powerpoint WORD FOR WORD!

Take Moyer for this class, she knows her stuff, she is very confident, she speaks Germ beautifully and she gives you a syllabus with the homework for throughout the semester. Iaonzi is just a nervous reck that needs to pick a different career!",1291
klank,5,,,"Richard Klank is the best art teacher I have ever had. He is knowledgeable, great artist and he is always there for his students.  He is one of the most interesting human beings I have ever met in my life. 10 years has past since my graduation and I still think he is the best. The ones who gave him a bad review do not know who he is and  must know little about art,for sure. ",1292
klank,2,A+,ARTT150,"I hace known him through a few classes, and both theoretical and studio work. Klank is a materialistic ego maniac with a dwarf complex that has left him baffled for the simple fact that he never made it to anything of artistic worth. It's simple: he made it to the art scene of abstract-expressionism when the movement was well out of the picture and very well saturated. In this sense, he could never possibily be an original artist and he certainly is not one now and will never be one in the future, if you'd assume that there is such thing imaginable for him.
Due to these matters, his classes are filled with a thirst for confirmation. He spends hours of lectures trying to convince his students, who mostly are taking the class as a CORE requirement and don't give a shit, that he indeed is a great artist.
His overt focus on mystic elements of art is also a result of his inferiority complex; an attempt to add a superficial layer of value to his otherwise dull and unbecoming character.
He does have a good eye for art though. If you are an art student and can handle a pompous-for-no-good-reason teacher who would rather talk about himself most of the time, I suggest you befriend him and get his personal opinion on your work. He does not care for technique much but his understanding of color and composition is decent. He also knows the art market somewhat well because he used to buy art for rich people.
BS and superficial mysticism as well as an attempt to talk to him about mental illness and the subconscious are the easiest tools to manipulate him with. He's certainly not a leader-type person therefore convincing him that you value his work and life is the key to get him to like you and speak highly of you.
He is a bit of a creep but a harmless one nevertheless.
Take his class, BS your way, agree with him, praise him, get his critique of your work,  but then move on. He's not the kind of a professor that you can benefit from for more than one or two classes.",1292
klank,1,,ARTT150,"Really wish I had gotten to take this course with a different professor. Klank is really unorganized and often changed due dates of assignments and would forget to tell all the sections. He has a terrible attitude and often would ask students for their opinions and then tell them they were wrong. When students expressed distress, he told them to stop trying and that he didn't care if anyone liked him because he had ten-year and couldn't be fired. I wish I had had a professor who cared about his students and his job instead of just being a crappy prof because he knew he could get away with it. This is really disappointing to me because the actual material and readings for this class are really interesting. ",1292
klank,3,,ARTT150,"I think this class could have been much more engaging thereby making the students more responsive to the material being taught. 

I was frustrated with the lack of structure in the class and the elusive requirements listed for assignments, that often times I didn't want to listen to Klank even though a lot of the things he said still rung something inside of me. 

The course material is very interesting and speaks to things that can be seen around you, but the way it is taught doesn't do the material justice. ",1292
klank,5,A,ARTT150,"I am a business student and was worried going into this class (I only took it as a CORE class).  Nearing the end of the semester, I have to say this is one of the greatest classes I have ever taken. If you are in college to actually learn about yourself and the world around you, I think this will be a great course to take. 
However, I think some students expect a simple outline of what they have to do to get an A in a class and they will do that minimum just to get that much closer to their degree.  Not saying there is a problem with that, but that mindset limits learning and the real purpose of higher education.  This is where I think most people get frustrated with Klank's teaching method. 
With that said, the work is not hard at all in the class, as far as work goes its probably one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. You can browse over the readings and say a few words in discussion classes and discussion exams and do fine. BUT this is the class where I have had to THINK the most... I have experienced news ways of thinking that relate to every aspect of my life, not just art. ",1292
klank,2,A,ARTT150,"Book is a waste of money. I BS'd the field trips and papers but apparently the TA's were all fools and didn't care much.

Lecture was as exciting as watching paint dry. Paint that would talk to you every second with ""I am now drying. ____% dried"".

None of the class cuties went to lecture, so it was just a nasty sausage fest that made me want to throw up.

Consider taking it with another professor...

Verdict: Klank - Jokester. ",1292
klank,1,A,ARTT150,"This class will involve a lot of BS on your part, just to get that out of the way. The professor will go on a tangent every class so attending or not is up to you. However, the professor will literally read the exam answers on the class before the exams so you should definitely attend the class on those days. Discussions are required because they are a big part of your grade. You will have to make some questions about the readings and you will occasionally have discussion exams but they are nothing too difficult. The class is really easy so you should not having too much trouble if you do all your assignments.
",1292
klank,5,A,ARTT150,"I thought this class was pretty cool. I didn't realize how much theory was in the class, but it wasn't bad at all. The TA grades very easily. There is a LOT of reading to do, which I didn't do, but still managed to do very well in the class. You are assigned to go to museums in DC to see artwork, but I found some of the work interesting so it wasn't so grueling. Buy the books online or used at bookholders. His class might not make sense at first, but I began to understand things he was saying towards the end; the material is so simple, yet abstract. He does talk a lot about his life, which I think he plays up, but he seems to tie his stories into the class material. Overall, pretty good class and a nice teacher.",1292
klank,3,A,ARTT150,"The guy was average as a professor and in general the class was really easy.

Attendance was 33% of or grade. There are assigned seats as if we were all kids in gradeschool again.

There are many exhibitions we need to go to over the course of the semester to write 2 midterm papers on. The exams are just his self-defined material on beauty, the spheres of mind, etc..

Everything was just so boring and idiotic in general. 

To be honest I only went to class because we had a rather beautiful and alluring TA. If she weren't TAing the course there would be no point in going anymore. That's how bad the class is in terms of excitement.",1292
klank,1,A,ARTT150,"What complete BS. Do not take it if you're willing to sit hours on end and listen to his life stories. Every lecture consists of him in front of the class force-feeding the students to accept his ideals. Naturally a theory class is subjective, but prepare to have your opinions deflated into nothing because he's extremely pompous and arrogant. 

The course itself is complete trash. Utter nonsense words are used to describe the simplest terms. 

The TA's have no faith or interest in the class. There's ALOT of miscommunication and it's very unclear when assignments are due. 

The thing about it is that you WILL get an A if you go to these ""discussion"" exams, and exhibitions. Your paper grade will be based on the mood of the TA. If he's having a bad week, watch out. Midterm and final is okay since they go through all the garbage material with you, so all you have to do is memorize. REALLY difficult to enjoy the class and it's a COMPLETE waste of time.

Consider taking Weil for this CORE. Klank is just ...ugh.",1292
klank,1,F,ARTT150,"Class is just pure nonsense. Everything is so naturally unnaturally idiotic.

There are all these garbage terms one has to  review, plenty of laughable exhibitions one has to go to, and jokester discussions and attendance that one must attend to avoid losing 1/3 of your grade over. 

TAs are not only uninterested in teaching the course, but they have the AUDACITY to give 64/90+ ppl a failing grade on the midterm paper.

Do not take this class for a core. If you are an art or sociology major.... good luck. May your devastating journey net you a passing grade.",1292
klank,2,,ARTT150,"He seems like a nice and cool guy, but I have problems with his class/teaching style. The TA had little interest in the class and there didn't seem to be much communication with him and Klank. REALLY difficult to get a concrete answer on what exactly the assignments were and when they were due; very unclear. Klank went on tangents ALL lecture then would try to cram in important actual information that was relevant to the class. Very, very difficult to take notes on his class, as most of the class is him telling stories (albeit usually interesting ones).",1292
klank,2,A,ARTT150,"The professor is very, very tangential. Essentially, his teaching style involves telling stories about his life, that often don't relate to course material. I also didn't care much for the course material, which was highly conceptual. For example, the class' definition of ""form"" was ""the thing that makes the thing the thing that it is"".

He's very nice and a lenient grader, but I struggled to pay attention in lecture.",1292
klank,5,,ARTT150,AMAZING teacher- can make the most boring stuff interesting.,1292
klank,3,B,ARTT150,"Such a nice guy and he has so many interesting things to say, except he only says interesting things, nothing relating to the class or the books we read. kinda wack and makes the class a lot harder than it should be ",1292
layton_richard,5,A,MUSC150,"For the lecture part on MWF, the majority of the work for the class comes from keeping up with the reading, with occasional homework in the workbook to supplement it. So if you don't do the reading there is really not much work at all, but it is also harder to grasp the material. Layton is great at explaining it, but the class is only an hour long and there is a lot of material. Layton's tests are pretty much exactly like all the worksheets you do for the unit, just all combined into one test so you have to watch your time. And there are a few definitions, too, which you don't cover in homework, so make sure you review those before tests.

As for Layton himself, he is probably one of the best teachers I've ever had. He not only holds everyone's attention, but he entertains us. I am not a morning person and this was my first class everyday at 9 AM, so I would skip this class a lot if he wasn't a good teacher. But I actually enjoy coming to theory, which is something none of my other music major friends at other schools can say.

As for the ear training on T/Th, I'm probably biased because I'm a singer but I found it really easy. I didn't have to do anything outside of class for aural skills, I just showed up and sight sang and did the dictations and I'm pretty sure my grade is fairly close to 100%. Even if it is a challenge for some people, if you prepare the melodies before hand like you're suppposed to the class should be an easy A and will help pad your grade if your grade in lecture is borderline. And John is awesome. I specifically tried to get him again next semester because he is really nice and good at explaining things. He's a little awkward, but that might just be because he's new at teaching or maybe it's just how he is.",1293
layton_richard,5,A,MUSC150,Very funny teacher! Loves the students and explains stuff very well. I think he's a little picky when grading and the test arent as easy as you think. Overall i think i have a B in the class but the Lab portion will boost me up to an A since its 40% of your whole grade. The Lab section by the way is extremely easy,1293
layton_richard,5,A,MUSC150,"Dr. Layton is an AMAZING professor. He's entertaining, engaging, and a wonderful teacher. He makes sure to get to know all of his students, and his corny theory jokes make class enjoyable. His homework is straightforward, and I'd say he usually assigns it about once a week. He often travels to other schools to teach, so he is known to randomly cancel class. Exams are very reasonable.  Definitely take Layton if you get the chance!",1293
reynnells,5,A+,ENGL390,take him. that's the short answer. just take him. take him. take him. it will be the funniest and most comfortable class of your life. just look at the grade data. he is a great guy and will treat you with nothing but respect-- he got to know us all and made class seem like a get-together. you get out early if things move smoothly. take him. join his class. ,1294

Two papers throughout the semester and optional third for extra credit. Would absolutely recommend Prof. Chiles' classes to anyone, history or not -- be prepared to participate in discussion and do work on par with other upper level history classes, and enjoy.",1298

chiles,4,C,HIST201,"I had Mr. Chiles fully online this semester and all his lecture were through YouTube video which wasn't to bad because you could re-watch them as many times as you want. But since I had ADHD it was kind of hard to pay attention but the class was very flexible because you could watch the videos at anytime. Also the weekly writing discussion weren't to bad as long as you watch the videos and the class discussion with the TA were really helpful. Also if you participated you'll get all the points, if it's verbally or even through the chats. My TA was so nice too she's Ms. Kocher and I would contact her instead of Mr. Chiles If I wanted a faster response with my emails. She was also very understanding with my disability and my commendations when it came to the essays and the only reason I got a C was because I never completed one of the major essay's which was my fault. If I had done so I would've probably gotten a B or A but other then that this class was pretty nice and I really love history so other then that I would recommend it. ",1298
chiles,1,A-,HIST201,"Prior to taking HIST201 I read a ton of reviews on Chiles and HIST201 saying it would be one of the more interesting and easy geneds. I am here to warn you that this is definitely not the case. Chiles does put alot of effort into his video lectures but he should have added additional materials likes slides so that we could separate the important points from the trivial points instead of having to digest all the info from the entire video.

I guess the grading depends on your TA but my TA was absolutely ruthless and nitpicky for even the smallest details on the exams and essays. I felt like she was doing this just to lower the average, even when my responses were detailed enough. You think your essay deserves a 100? Nah you're probably gonna get an 85, best case 90. There was busy-work every week in the form of discussion boards which did not help me learn or prepare for exams whatsoever.

So the bottom line is if you hate writing, avoid this course. 3 stars for Chiles, 1 star for the overall way this course was set up, and -10 stars for the TAs for their grading style. A course that was supposed to be interesting was unnecessarily transformed into a super boring and tedious course.",1298

Class has some writing and 2 books for reading but there used to be weekly reading which he got rid of. Exams were identifying major events and he gives you a study guide with ones that may appear. Overall very straightforward. However, TA has a lot to do with your grading.",1298
chiles,5,A+,HONR239G,"Dr. Chiles is genuinely among the best lecturers in the entire university. He is humble and open, an extraordinary lecturer, incredibly thoughtful, and worldly and clever to boot. His typical history classes are more demanding than this, and they involve drier reading with lots more factual retention, but I know they too are great at expressing narratives.

This class in particular is likely never being offered again, which is a shame, as it truly is remarkable. In essence, it is a book club wherein, through reading novels weekly and discussing them at length for two-and-one-half hours, you learn about the history of America through its stories and themes therein. It focuses a lot on humanism and the experience of the underprivileged in the nation, especially immigrants, beginning in our case from about 1850 until modern day. This is the only Zoom class I have been in where everyone always showed up, always had their camera on, and always participated, usually enthusiastically. Almost every student showed up to an optional, extra-credit class even, despite the average grade being an A-/A. If something like this is ever offered again and you enjoy or have enjoyed or think you might enjoy reading, then I would highly suggest it. It also helps you with communication skills and structuring arguments. (I would say writing, too, but the big term paper on the book/week you chose to lead the discussion was reduced in scope.)

Of course it will help you but if you work or take 5 classes like me it would be almost impossible to do all of the work she assigns.  Also, she is a very hard grader.  All of her exams are essays so be prepared to make PERFECT sense because she is no joke.  I did learn a lot from this course and it is very interesting its just a lot of work",1303
muncy,3,,HIST211,"Muncy is a great lecturer. She is SO passionate, and makes history interesting (well, as interesting as it can be). She was probably the best professor I've had this year. She's very likeable. 

However, do not take this class if you aren't serious about it, and it would help if you like history. I don't like history very much, and I thought this class sounded interesting enough so I signed up for the CORE requirement. Big mistake. I regret it. Although Muncy is great, there is a ridiculous amount of reading assigned for each lecture, and a good sized chapter of reading for discussion every week. Discussion is graded strictly, so if you're quiet it's a huge disadvantage. If you like to talk and you read the assigned reading, that will help you tons, discussion is a good chunk of your total grade.

Two exams, one is 10% of the final grade, the other is 20%. She gives you the possible essay questions and terms you have to define a week beforehand, she randomly chooses an essay on exam day and 2-5 pre-chosen terms. All that is nice and fair in theory. However. While 3 possible exam choices was do-able for the midterm (3 detailed outlines to create), 5 possible questions for the final was...crazy. For me, at least. The questions are very broad, so it's a lot of information. And I don't know who reads every single assigned reading, not me, so I had to skim through it all for relevant information. Just so much to remember; I  got so stressed. 

There is a 8-10 page magazine analysis. Like another reviewer said, not hard, but so time-consuming. And my TA said mine was well done but I still got a B. So I guess it depends on how hard your TA grades..

If you do not procrastinate, read everything, participate actively, overall just put A LOT of effort into this, I'm sure an A is possible. Just be forewarned, even if you put a good amount of work and really want an A, if you don't participate actively and really put time into exam preparation...good luck. I tried my best for an A, and I am a 4.0 Honors student (so far, there is a good chance I'll get a B in this class). ",1303
muncy,4,B,HIST211,she's a great professor...so enthusiastic! however her class is not a joke. not many assignments and they are graded strictly. you have to read a lot for the class especially the first semester (she covered most of the stuff from the readings in lecture second semester)...very long readings you had to do for discussion...and you basically have to participate the entire discussion to do well. 8-10 page paper that was not hard but SOOO time consuming. reconsider taking this class for a core. it was my hardest class,1303
muncy,5,A-,HIST211,"She is so passionate about the subject that lectures were so much fun to go to.  She knows what she's talking about and is so animated in teaching.
Discussions were kind of annoying because you were supposed to read a (long) passage and come being able to discuss it.  Your grade depended on how many times you contributed to the discussion, if you spoke once- D, if you spoke twice-C, and so on.
But overall, I would definitely advise taking this class.",1303
zambrana,1,,WMST200,"This class was one of the most horrible classes I have ever taken. I am counting the minutes until its over. 

The amount of reading is unbelievable, and I had to put all of my other classes on the back burner just to keep up with the work.

Not to mention the fact that the work consisted wholly of being unbelievably racist towards white people, demonizing any person who has money, and hating on the U.S.A. any chance they could get.

This class was horrible because of the amount of work, and that I had to read every single night about how I was the devil reincarnated. 

This class literally taught how AIDS was created by white people for the sole purpose of eradicating blacks and furthering the white societal goal of genocide of minorities. Oh, and granting abortion rights to women also furthered the white goal of genocide. Essentially, every achievement made by women, such as granting abortion rights, was spit upon as racist against minorities.

You had to study an unbelievable amount of reading for each exam. The class had two exams, and two large papers.

This is not a bad review solely based off of my grade. I got an A. But my grade is rare.

 Alot of people failed the midterm for writing their own views. After the exam was graded the professor literally spent 10-15 minutes of class discussing how it is not possible to be racist towards whites. And that some people mentioned racism towards whites on the exam, and that this view is wrong - which ultimately contributed to them not receiving points. (I had the sense not to do that)

I got an A because I wrote about how horrible white people are, how democracy is an illusion, and how I am actually unconsciously racist even if I don't realize it. Not to mention how America hates all minorities, and how all white people of european descent are actually satan and systematically oppress every type of person known to man through our ""unearned status"" based upon a highly flawed, and false system of meritocracy.

Essentially, if you are willing to lie through your teeth, and hate on every aspect of America and yourself then take this class.

I went into this class a democrat and a feminist. I came out a republican, and anti-feminist.",1305
islam,4,A-,ENGL101,Nice and lenient but a bit of a harsh grader in my opinion. Maybe writing just isn't for me though. ,1308
islam,4,A+,ENGL101H,I BSed most of my writing and it was a pretty easy class. She isn't very authoritative and you can literally just not participate in any discussions in Zoom and still get by. Don't think I would have learned much anyways (?) ,1308
islam,3,A,ENGL391,"Sabrina Islam is fine. It's an English class, so the professor doesn't really matter much. I skipped probably about half the lectures, and I'm still doing fine. If you can write decent papers, this class is easy. If you struggle with writing, then you might have some trouble.

My biggest complaint is that it takes forever for her to grade papers. Some of the assignment descriptions are kind of hard to get the hang of (maybe I should've gone to class more), so it was hard to tell sometimes if I was really writing about what the paper was supposed to be about. Since it took so long for the grades to come back, it kind of left me in suspense for a long time. Oh well, the grading itself is pretty lenient, or at least I think it was.",1308
islam,4,A,ENGL391,"Very kind and clearly passionate about English. Didn't do a great job making the class engaging in the online platform, but would take professional writing with her again if given the opportunity.

dammeyer,4,B+,ENGL101,"Ms. Dammeyer is definitely one of the better ENGL101 professors. The class - of course - was pretty difficult, and there was a lot of work and several papers to write, but Dammeyer was always there for extra help. A lot of her assignments made you think outside the box and be creative, which was awesome. You'll really feel yourself becoming a better writer throughout the class - though you may not really love the workload at the time. I would recommend her to anyone who has to take ENGL101. She's a very sweet lady whose so friendly and very helpful. Go to her office hours! You won't regret it.",1314

dowman,5,A,SPAN301,"I was really anxious to take this class because I hadn’t taken Spanish for a couple years, but it wasn’t as bad as I thought. Dr. Dowman was really enthusiastic about Spanish, and it showed through her interactions with my class. The coursework isn’t bad—you have usually 5-8ish online HW to complete by each class, which is manageable. But occasionally we’ll have 12+ assignments due in one day, so it’s important to schedule it out. 
Overall, Dr. Dowman is good at communicating her expectations to us, and it’s really easy to ask her questions about our essays (which compose most of the total grade). If you take SPAN301, you won’t regret it!",1315
dowman,2,,SPAN370,"Pretty unimpressed with Dowman, unfortunately. She is generally pretty nice and friendly but is a harsh grader, doesn't grade things fairly, and appears to have favorite students. 

She generally grades stuff hard - takes off lots of points for grammar issues, minor points, that type of thing. Homework is definitely overgraded - it's already long (13+ multipart questions) and she grades them pretty closely. 

Also doesn't grade stuff fairly sometimes. Takes off points randomly (she ""justifies"" it but they're not really legitimate) and won't accept requests for regrades. Contesting any grade is generally not worth your time at all. 

Likely has favorite students (mostly those that keep their cameras on). 

Unclear about directions sometimes - a lot of people messed up on a certain project and she gave everyone 60s instead of letting them redo it or accepting it, since so many people messed up. ",1315
humud,5,A+,HHUM106,So so nice! I think she is such a nice and good professor. She genuinely wants you to learn about the humanities and makes it interesting while doing so. You can always tell how passionate she is about what she teaches. She also leaves almost all of your projects open-ended and even lets you write your own section of the rubric to include your own expectations so that you can be creative with the assignment. I absolutely loved her and would take any of her classes again.,1317

She's also really understanding, so make sure to communicate any concerns or questions you may have and it'll be easy to work out with her.",1317
humud,5,A,HHUM206,Dr. Humud is very nice and is always willing to chat about class projects or a student's plan for their future. She is great at bouncing ideas around and suggesting helpful things for students who are indecisive. The class load is never too much. ,1317
sosnowski,5,,SPAN363,"I love this class (I don't even really like Spanish lit, but Saul makes it so tolerable). Saul is a wonderful and engaging lecturer who adds a lot more context to the readings. He's very intelligent and knows everything there is to know about every story we read and all the historical context behind it. He interacts really well with students, making the class fun. 
I wish grades were uploaded to the grade book - while I think I'll do well in the class, I would like to have a little more certainty. 
A paper rubric for the final paper and the group project would be appreciated, despite the clarity of instructions during class. 
There are 4 grades, I think? 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 final paper (5-10 pages), and 1 group project. ",1318
giovacchini,3,,,"Very intelligent and engaging professor. An eccentric and energetic teacher. Only reason giving 3 stars is because his course was sometimes hard to follow and could have used better structure. Otherwise the classes were well taught and mostly interesting. 

Course was very reading heavy but the books were thoughtfully selected.",1319
giovacchini,5,A,HIST142,"So you know a professor is good when the worst thing you can say about him is his name is too hard to spell. Professor Giovacchini was always incredibly knowledgeable and very good at getting students involved. He would often call on students at random which, to me at least, helped make sure everyone was up to date on readings and awake. Also, for our final project, he insisted on meeting with every group. While we met with him, he gave amazing guidance about sources and possible ideas.
He also did a great job of using his expertise to make the class more interesting. He primarily studies film history so he was great at demonstrating the role Hollywood has spread American culture. Also, we got to watch a lot of movies which I personally enjoyed more than the readings. Also our final was to write a movie script (for the scheduled final we just watched the movies). 
One of my favorite things about this class is just how well he kept bringing up earlier material. How many other teachers could relate Alexis de Tocqueville to Hollywood successfully?The only problem I had with Professor Giovacchini was that he sometimes seemed  to jump around a bit time-wise. Like it seems we barely focused on the mid to late 19th century (I really wanted to learn how Europeans felt about slavery) and then spent 2/3's of the class on the early and mid 20th century and we barely got to anything past the 1970's and 80's. 
So if you are primarily interested in the early industrial era, Giovacchini may not be for you. However, if you want an interesting class with a really smart, involved professor, take Giovacchini. I don't think I've ever seen a professor who tried so hard to have every student succeed.",1319
giovacchini,5,A,HIST457,"I would recommend him to anyone. There are a lot of readings, but outside of the first book, which is brutal, they are fairly enjoyable. If you take good notes in class and have some idea about the readings, tests and exams are a breeze. Tests are ID based usually with a mini-essay or two, nothing too difficult, very straighforward. But beware, he does like to call on people in class, so try and at least be familiar with the readings to avoid embarassment. But he is an extremely nice man who is very approachable outside of class. When I talked with him outside of class, it seemed like he actually cared about me as a person, rather than as simply a student. I would recommend turning in a rough draft of the final paper. It lightens the workload come exam time, and he also gives good feedback. Overall an enjoyable class if you are willing to put in the work, because you will get a lot out of it, and will be rewarded for your work.",1319
giovacchini,5,A,HIST457,"Really interesting class and professor. Not too many readings and a good mix of powerpoint, lecture and media clips. Two papers and a few exams that he graded generously. Great class made even better because it wasn't hard to do well!",1319
giovacchini,5,A-,HIST429D,"Giovacchini is one of the most interesting professors I have ever had. His classes were enjoyable, so it was easy to stay interested. The amount of reading is fairly heavy, so it is imperative that one stays on top of it. However, the readings assigned contained a wealth of knowledge, so they were worth doing. I would definitely consider taking another course with him. ",1319
giovacchini,4,,HIST457,"A good professor; he knows his stuff and is a very interesting person.  If you slack off and/or don't read, you will get burned.  Take the class if you are willing to put in the work, it is worth it.",1319

On multiple occasions she has been unable to answer even basic questions by email, and often deducts large amounts of points from your writing without explaining why. She also provides rubrics but refuses to use them. When you peer review other students, she makes you research their topics and give them sources to include in their paper - literally doing their work for them. It's really hard to do well in her class but grades are inflated for the low end, so everyone is pushed toward a mediocre grade. This course was more time consuming than the overwhelming majority of my engineering classes, even though the material is much easier, because she assigns so much unnecessary work.",1328

I really only spent 3 hours max a week on work aside from when we had big writing assignments due like the research paper and a 2 other major assignments. Aside from that, if you submit a decent enough paper you will do fine in this class. She even offers some extra credit at the end of the semester for doing course evaluations and going to the writing center. She really cares about her students and even though this was an online class, I really connected with her more than I do with other professors and she gives good feedback on your drafts to help you improve and get a good grade on the final draft.

If you ask for specific instances of the issues she mentions, she'll dodge the question and in one instance got super passive aggressive with me because she ""already told"" me that I had the issue.....

amodeo,3,,ITAL211,"If Amodeo wasn't my teacher, I would love her. She is goofy and funny and exactly what the other review said, a ""crazy Italian grandmother.""

But as a teacher, she is frustrating. She never says what she wants out of us, she just wants us to talk constantly about cities in Italy. I feel like I learned a lot about the historical monuments in Italy this semester but my speaking in Italian, the whole point of 211, didn't really improve at all. And when we have to talk in front of the rest of the class, she makes everyone critique you and points out everything you did wrong, which is nerve-wracking. The final is a half-hour conversation with just her, which I am actually looking forward to because I will do better speaking with just her than standing in front of the whole class and it will help my grade. Honestly, considering how little I speak out in class, she probably thinks I'm an idiot.",1330
amodeo,3,,ITAL203,"I give Amodeo a conditional 3 stars, because my situation is different from most others. I went on her study abroad in Genoa (where she's originally from) in January 2008, and then took this class Spring 2008, so she got to know me personally. I also live in the Italian cluster of the Language House, for which she is the Faculty Mentor, so you could say I'm one of her favorites. She is your typical crazy Italian grandmother: a funny and great person to know and be around, but could be better at teaching.

For example, 203 is the second semester grammar course. Her lesson structure is nearly non-existant, and often flies by the wind. She expects students to do too much work, and does not realize the students' comprehension of Italian is much much lower than what she thinks it is. At times she seems to forget we all take other classes.

That being said, if you are passionate about learning Italian, she'll like you, and you'll do fine. If you're only taking this class because of a requirement, I would find someone else.",1330

He uses Powerpoint heavily, but most of them are borderline-not-English paragraphs that he reads straight off the screen and doesn't elaborate on. He has a heavy accent and is sometimes difficult to follow. Everything discussed in class was straight out of the readings, so attendance in the class was pretty low. The first half of the course spent on Elizabeth I was much more interesting than the second half spent on Mary Queen of Scots, and I wish the class studied more about ""the propaganda and myth"" of their regimes like the description of the class promised.  There are two papers, a term paper, a midterm and a final. He is a bit of a finicky grader, but not unreasonable. Take the class if you are already interested in the topic, but reconsider if you are looking for an engaging elective.",1331

The class itself is very enjoyable. We read several novels about utopias and had a few presentations with a final term paper. The atmosphere is very fun and relaxed. Really glad I took the class! ",1333
mansbach,5,B,ARTH201,"Great professor. Tremendous speaking voice that can hold your attention for the entire class period. He does have a tendency to use vocabulary which might be unfamiliar to some, as well as get a bit poetic with his descriptions of works, to the extent that it becomes confusing what one ought to write down / commit to memory and what one ought to simply let soak in. However, he balances that out by making it crystal clear which artists / works are peripheral and which ones you should probably remember. Nine times out of ten, those are the works you will see on the exams, especially on the final. That's not to say you shouldn't remember the others, because being able to recall lesser-known but no less relevant works in your essays is always a plus.

As another reviewer mentioned, the professor / TA's place emphasis on knowing the socio-political context in which the various Western art movements formed and flourished, and not at all on rote memorization of slides, dates and whatnot. There were all too many exam essays where I couldn't recall the name of the work, nor the artist, nor the date - heck there were even paintings that I had never seen before because I had missed that particular class - but I never received anything less than a ""B"" on an in-class essay (they grade to the ""C"" as being average) simply because I talked about the work in the context of its time period / art movement and the stylistic trappings of that era.

So, if you're not good with names, dates, etc, don't sweat it and take Steven Mansbach's class! I guarantee it will be an interesting and enriching experience.",1333
mansbach,5,A,ARTH350,"Simply put, he is the best. As a professor, yes--he is exceptional in every regard as an educator, not only incredibly knowledgeable but also a dynamic, engaging, captivating speaker and lecturer.

As a human being--he recognizes talent and is generous in his appreciation. He is as good a listener as he is a speaker. He is approachable and friendly, and never before have I met a professor with whom I genuinely enjoyed talking to, and with whom it was so easy and natural. 

He combines philosophy, politics, and theory with art in a way that is astounding. For the love of god, do yourself a favor and take a course with him, I promise you won't be disappointed.  ",1333
mansbach,5,A-,ARTH201,"Dr. Mansbach is hands down the best professor I have had so far. He is a great lecturer and the class material is really interesting. He and the TA's do a lot to help you out and get a good grade.
 The hardest part of any art history class is slide id's, especially for a course that covers so much material like this one. Dr. Mansbach, however, puts almost no emphasis on actually knowing the name and date of a painting (I got A's on all of the exams and correctly identified maybe half of the art works). The only slide id's we had to do were in discussion, and they were broken into a few weeks worth of lecture material at a time, so they weren't that bad.",1333

The course is difficult. There are A LOT of paintings to memorize and it is difficult to remember all of the information about each stylistic time period. Assignments consisted of two exams, three quizzes, one paper, and the final. Lyndsay Bratton was a great TA. She was helpful in clarifying the concepts and wanted her students to do well. This was a very interesting course for a HA core, but it involves work so be prepared to study. ",1333
mansbach,4,B,ARTH350,"How has no one written about this professor yet? He is, first of all, the highest paid professor in the art history department, considering well.. he's written scholarly texts and is a renowned professor. 

He is not easy. And it can be a good or a bad thing. Good thing - he knows his stuff. Too well. Just like most of the art history professors. At times, I thought he'd make up words but no.. intense vocabulary. And he'll throw in some German and French just to spice the lecture up. 

Bad if you are going to slack off on the paper. He's the toughest grader I've had, because he can really see right through the bull and the slacking. 

I highly recommend him because its really rare to get such a great professor, even if he is a tough grader.  I felt he really challenged students intellectually.",1333
mansbach,5,A,ARTH201,"Professor Mansbach was an awesome professor whose passion and knowledge are evident in his lectures. Like others mentioned, he's quite eloquent and poetic in his descriptions of paintings, but they only help the student in remembering specific phrases and vocabulary for those specific paintings. 
This class is only graded on 5 factors: participation in discussion, two midterms, a paper (you have to go to the national gallery of art to view a painting), and a final exam. He gives around 40 paintings to memorize per midterm, but most of the content consists of understanding the context/history of what was going on at that time and how that affected art, so the textbook is key for that. 
I don't know if it was like this for other semesters, but he was pretty lenient on grading, especially if he saw improvement in the student's work. I usually studied by just memorizing the paintings dates/names and reading the textbook a few days before. 
His TA Tony was also super cool. He was always available to help students and constantly encouraged us to do our best. 
Take this class if u wanna broaden ur mind ahahha",1333
mansbach,4,A,ARTH201,"Professor Mansbach is great, but the class organization (at least online) has led to quite a difficult time. Mansbach is a lovely professor with a fantastic voice, and he has a beautiful passion for art history. I really enjoyed listening to his lectures. On the other hand, at least online the class was not organized well. It was entirely run by the TA's, and I often felt that grading could be arbitrary (and often took over a month). I ended up with an A, but I know a lot of people did not but probably deserved one. In general, quality of writing is a huge deal on the midterm and final exam, so keep this in mind if you're considering taking the class as a gen-ed. If you cannot write well you almost certainly will not get an A in this class. Getting an A requires a strong understanding and memory of important compositional elements and to be able to apply them to various time periods and styles well. This class is not easy but it is very rewarding. I know so much more about art now, and I am very thankful to Professor Mansbach for that gift. ",1333
mansbach,4,,,"heard great things about this course, but it seemed to be a lot different in the pandemic setting. You learn a lott of cool things, but try to take it in person because it is overwhelming online and it is asynchronous (so not as fun as it could be). Lectures were supposed to be 50 minutes, but they were on average 90+ minutes (and this is 2 lectures + discussion/week). Heavily run by TAs during fall 2020, and seemed to be a little disorganized. Wish I took it in person, but I still learned a lot and liked the class. ",1333
woo,5,A,PHIL318X,"Great guy. Extremely knowledgeable and funny. Makes class as interesting as he can. 

He's very understanding of student needs and would rather make students learn than work unnecessarily for a grade. This leads to his class being both low-stress and thought-provoking. I would definitely recommend his class. ",1334
woo,4,B,,Lectures are dull but he get the point across.  Test are very difficult and based on total knowledge of the subject matter—many questions are essay format.,1334

pramschufer,4,A,ENGL101,"Though she was a pretty good teacher. I didn't agree with all of her opinions, but the class was good. She'll let you come to her office hours/send her your paper as many times as you want and she'll practically grade it before you turn it in. She was energized and cares about her students. At least for ENG101 she was a really good teacher.",1335
pramschufer,2,,AMST204,"Pramschufer was an alright teacher. She came to class energized and ready to teach, which was nice. But she was unethical and biased with her grades. This was a film class and we had to write analysis of the films, which no one knew how to do. She did not teach us about this, yet expected us to know how to write a perfect paper. It was very unethical and therefore I would not recommend you take her class. ",1335
pramschufer,5,A,,"Professor Pramschufer is a fantastic teacher. It wasn't until the middle of the semester that we started to appreciate her super dry sarcasm. I really enjoyed taking her class, and she does a great job of making sure that her students are prepared for assignments. I learned a lot about writing, and I always felt comfortable asking questions and seeking help. ",1335
pramschufer,5,,,"Professor Pramschufer is probably one of the best I've had at UMD. She is always cheerful in class and willing to meet with students if office hours do not work out. She is always excited about the texts she teaches and even offers extra credit. She does grade a little hard, but is always there to help with  every step of each essay if you ask her. I took this class because I'm not an English major and wanted to improve my writing, and I can definitely say that she has helped to improve my writing. Take a class with her!",1335
pramschufer,4,,,"Pramshufer is really nice. I think she got a little overwhelmed at times, but overall ran the classroom well. She is a difficult grader, but so are most English teachers at Maryland. That being said, if you work hard, you will probably get an A. You just have to be willing to put in the effort. A writing intensive course, not a lot of reading though. ",1335
pramschufer,4,,,"This professor is very enthusiastic about her class and what she is teaching. Shes really patient and always there to help her students if asked. The only criticism I have is that she grades a little hard, but it is a 300 level class and Im not an english major so its to be expected",1335
pramschufer,5,A-,ENGL101,"Prof. Pramschufer is very sweet. She’s very forgiving and her TA, Roya is very nice and understanding. The class has a pretty heavy/ moderate work load depending on what other classes you’re taking because you can get a little over whelmed with all of the essays and assignments in addition to your other courses. the class is pretty straight forward, especially if you took AP english in high school. Professor Pramschufer, as well as her TA are always willing to help and answer questions which is good. I would definitely recommend visiting their office hours a lot because Professor is very strict about what she wants to see on your essays, especially with exigence, cohesion, and works cited pages.

lowderbaugh,5,A,ENGL394,"Dr. Lowderbaugh is a great professor. He is very willing and open to help you out with whatever questions you may have, and he is very responsive and accomodating with his e-mails. 

The class requires a good deal of effort and is different from the writing that most students are used to. Professor Lowderbaugh will teach you how to write appropriately for the business world, which most students don't already know how to do.

If you are willing to put in the effort and listen to Professor Lowderbaugh's suggestions and comments and incorporate them into your writing, you should have no problem with getting an A. However, if you choose to think that your writing is already good enough for the business world and that Professor Lowderbaugh's comments aren't representative of how the real world is like, your grades will suffer.",1345
lowderbaugh,1,,ENGL394,"You should not take this class with this teacher.  You do not understand just how awful he really is.  Every class is him talking about nothing and then repeating himself and then you work in groups to edit your papers.  Your group members are no better at writing than you and offer little help.  Additionally, you have to write all the papers on your own. Most of the other junior English classes have you working in groups.  Instead you spend an entire semester making up information for a proposal that is really stupid.  This class is way too much work to get the grade. This teacher just set you up to fail.",1345
lowderbaugh,5,A,ENGL381,"Prof Lowderbaugh really cares about his students.  He was readily available to talk to me after class (and office hours).  Taking a 3 hour class can become boring, but he tried to keep us awake.  In my opinion, he shouldn't have done the exact same thing every class - it became old fast.  ",1345
lowderbaugh,5,A,ENGL394,"This was the most challenging course I have EVER taken in my life. Professor Lowderbaugh offers all his help so that his students receive the highest grades. He lets you rewrite papers and offers student conferences when asked. Taking his class, I feel, has extremely improved my professional writing skills. My final proposal from the class received good feedback with my supervisor (the proposal written in class is sent to the supervisor).

Unlike other engl394 courses, you work on a proposal individually and the workload is immense. It requires research beyond mckeldin, and its unconventiality made it the most difficult class EVER.

I worked really hard for my A, but at the end of day, I liked the class even though I had mini panic attacks every tues and thurs when I had the class.",1345

lowderbaugh,1,,ENGL394,"Mr. Lowderbaugh has to be one of the worst professors at the University of Maryland. I hated having to attend his classes, he has no idea what he is talking about and everyone would have to sit while he fumbled through his 'lecture'. I have no idea why he is allowed to teach, none at all. He should have been fired a long time ago. ",1345
moser,4,B,ENGL302,"This class is easy. You only have to do 3 short papers, 1 long paper, a midterm and a final. I have taken many ENGL classes that assign much more writing.

moser,4,,ENGL302,"He's definitely a good professor and pushes you to think very deeply about medieval literature. The class isn't flat out easy though, maybe because I took it online and I didn't know much about medieval lit until I took the class. It's definitely challenging (heavy reading): weekly quizzes, weekly discussion boards, two response papers that are due before you actually talk about the text in class meaning you have to read the book or text and write a paper on it in advance (which was a bit of a shocker but it was fine once you get used to it), two other essays (midterm and final), and then two short discussion leader ""papers"" (only like 300 words).

Just was the TA that semester and really helped bring the class full circle.",1349
zeller,3,A,GEMS104,"Dr. Zeller isn't that bad. Yes, the class is fairly boring and a ton of seemingly pointless work, but its really not terrible. If you put in your share of the work on the team paper and delegate work within your team, the paper is not hard. Lecture is usually pretty boring, but if you go to lecture, its really easy to participate in discussion without doing the readings. Dr. Zeller is a nice guy, just not a particularly interesting lecturer. 
Overall, a lot of work, but most of it isn't extremely difficult. ",1349
zeller,3,B,HIST205,"Dr. Zeller is a very nice man. He does have a German accent, but he is not difficult to understand. The class is challenging. Assignments included weekly page-long writings due in discussion, two papers, one midterm, and the final. Discussion is mandatory if you want to receive a decent participation grade. Attendance is taken every week. I was disappointed in the grading of the second paper. The TA said it was a challenging assignment, and would therefore not be graded harshly. This was not the case. I received a C and have never received below a B on a paper in college. Other students were not pleased with the assignment either. Be prepared to study for the exams, also. They involve a large amount of writing. I preferred taking this course for my SH core because it was not a history class on a specific country. The material covered involved countries around the globe.",1349
zeller,3,A,GEMS104,"I honestly did not get the whole purpose of this class beyond the fact that there was tons and tons of busy work. I seriously had more work for this course than for any of my serious courses. Regardless, if you put the time in, it really isn't that hard...but you have to put A LOT of time in...no joke...more than should be required of any 100 level course...even for Gemstone...

Still, the lecture topics were interesting and I would say I learned some pretty fun and thought invoking things from them. I just will there was less emphasis on the busy work thinly veiled as a ""research paper"" ",1349
zeller,2,A,GEMS104,"Zeller teaches a class that honestly I think any middle school history teacher could teach. GEMS104 is ultimately a class about using common sense when learning about topics. Speaks in a monotone though and many people really space or doze off during class. Unreasonable enforcement of ""no distractions"" by TAs. Tries to make things more important and interesting than they really are which in turn makes him irritating. Final is easy; can be passed if you get the main points of the lecture from someone. Discussion is mandatory; topic discussion is often redundant while research discussion is a waste of time. Must do a 30 page paper which really isn't that bad since it's a group project. Unlike other professors that teach large lectures, he has input in your grades which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on which side of the fence you're on.",1349
zeller,4,B,,"  Professor Zeller is a very interesting guy.  Although there are things you might not particularly appreciate about his class, I think that you will enjoy it overall, and realize that it could be a lot worse!
  Most of the class required readings-ranging from the textbooks to online podcasts to articles on the website-and most were about very interesting topics!  Most of the class was based around discussions about the different topics, although there were some times where he did lecture.  We also went to a guest lecture, which was pretty cool!
  The biggest assignment due throughout the semester is the research project and the poster for it!  You don't have any exams, except for the final, which consisted of some IDs, a short essay, and a longer essay.  He does have shorter assignments throughout the year, but nothing too unbearable.  For the research project, he breaks it down into smaller sections (with due dates) so that you don't wait until the last minute to complete it!  He's a little strict on the research paper, especially regarding sources and formatting and such, but overall, it can help motivate you to do well when all is said and done.  Also, sometimes his workload and syllabus is a little unclear and unbalanced, but at the end of the semester, you'll have time to work on the research paper, so you should be able to pull a good grade on it.
  A couple of words of advice to students would be to make sure that you stay on top of the assignments and don't be afraid to take initiative! Professor Zeller can be a bit disorganized sometimes, but make sure to contact him if you're unsure about anything!  Also, make sure you come prepared to class and get involved, because participation makes a big impact on your grade, and he does take attendance via a sign-in sheet.  
   You should be able to pull an A in the class, but the only reason I put a B in the ""Grade Expected"" box was because I didn't want the reader to assume that it would be a ""gimme"" A.  A ""B"" is almost a definite grade if you do things as required, but getting the A will take a little extra desire and effort -although by no means is it unmanageable, because I pulled it off!",1349
zeller,3,B,HIST205,"I like Zueller as a person, and at times had lower energy humor that put a grin on my face. But I felt my time was wasted in his lectures. Zueller's format is 45 terms he covers in lecture throughout the semester, so you need to go to lecture right? Well..the terms for the most part lacked elaboration/historical context which is necessary for the final. You need to go to discussion though, Justin the TA does a better job setting the historical context. Word of warning though the readings at times were extremely dense, and made the class extremely boring. I learning a decent amount given the class' subject, but I would only recommend taking it if the topic of environmentalism/the environment is a passion you have.",1349
zeller,1,W,HIST205,"The grading expectations for a 200 level course are too high. There are weekly readings with a corresponding writing assignment - 200 words. There's no rubric yet he expects essay-level writing without contractions, first-person, generic identifiers (people, individuals), etc. I ended up spending 3-4 hours a week on this minimal assignment. Every single returned assignment was littered with criticisms, and never once did I get positive feedback. I was not the only student who did not understand their expectations; the average was between 50-80% each week.

There are two papers - both of which are 80% graded on writing style and 20% content. We were told numerous times to go to the writing center more than once. I went twice, and even had my former composition professor read through it. I edit textbooks as my job, yet I somehow only got an 85% on the paper, lowering my grade to a B+. I read through their critiques and disagreed with nearly all of them. I met with the prof and the TA multiple times before the paper and received zero guidance other than being told, ""If you cannot write at a collegiate level, you must go to the writing center.""

The material for the class is interesting, but there's a reason why a 200-level course has so few A's and so many W's. I am a senior and this is the first class I've ever dropped.",1349
zeller,5,A-,HIST205,"Dr. Zeller is the man!  He is like a encyclopedia when it comes to the information of the class, and he is always happy to elaborate or go over info that you don't understand.  The readings are a little lengthy, but they are usually pretty riveting (Especially the Cronan piece).  Justin (The TA) is also super knowledgeable and dedicated, and discussion sessions with him were always worth going to.  Overall a really great course, and not overly difficult either.",1349
hatcher,5,A+,ENGL101H,He was an extremely nice and fairly laid-back professor. He was always extremely understanding with everything that was going on because of the pandemic.

bleam,5,AB,LING200,"Professor Bleam is awesome asf! Her teaching methods were so fun and helpful! She gave us alot of practice homework BUT it helped us review for the exams and such. We also had alot of quizzes, but don't freak out because it was pretty easy IF you studied. And PLEASE study for her class. Honestly, her exams and quizzes are set up just like the study guides and practice homeworks etc. ALSO if you are confused just go to her office hours! She is so easy to approach and not scary at all! Also the TA's are great. Anton (and Bleam) helped me out with alot of questions I had about the homework and helped me understand better alot of concepts I did not fully understand. Overall, Bleam is a fun, energetic,and well prepared Professor. She is the best professor I've had so far in my career as university student!  :) I highly recommend her!",1352
bleam,5,A,LING240,"LOVED this class! so interesting, fun and easy. def take this class if you can!",1352
bleam,4,C,LING240,"I like her. She is very nice as a professor. The only downfall I see to this course is that even though you may understand something fully, you can still fail a quiz if you don't understand her format. The test are well put together, just watch out for the multiple choice. I also think there are too many exercises, there were times when I felt like I needed a break. It's like you relive the high school experience of homework, but they do help you learn. Other than those few things, you will learn a lot from this course. If you're not a linguistics major, you will come in thinking the subject is pointless and another version of hooked on phonics, but she does give you an insight to how it fits into our real world.",1352
bleam,5,B+,LING200,"Awesome class! Dr. Bleam is a great lecturer-to the point, simple, easy to understand, and very aware of student concerns. If you go to the lectures, at least skim the readings, you should not need to spend much time studying. I got A's on both midterms. Didn't do 1/5 homeworks, which lost me my A. The material is so interesting, nothing I have paid attention to before. Overall, a good CORE.",1352
bleam,5,A,LING200,"Dr. Bleam is such a sweet professor! She's really funny and down to earth, I go to class just to listen to her talk.

The class is really quite easy; Dr. Bleam makes all the notes available on ELMS, the homework and ""prep exercises"" keep you thinking about the material, and the required reading is minimal. Midterms don't really require studying as long as you can compartmentalize information well.

Besides that, the material is genuinely interesting and opens up topics most people never give a thought to. If you're looking for a class to fill up your schedule without eating your time, consider this one.",1352
bleam,5,A,LING200,"Dr. Bleam is a great professor who tries to engage her students and is a very nice person.

bleam,5,A,LING200,"I really liked the professor, she did a great job of explaining things thoroughly and not rushing through things. Very approachable, engaging. The tests aren't too hard as long as you know the concepts, but you do need to at least study. ",1352
bleam,4,A,LING200,"She is what inspired me to become a linguistics major! The class is simple: if you go to class, do the assignments and attend discussion, and A is nearly guaranteed. She is always willing to help, she will accommodate your schedule if you cannot make it to office hours, and she is really enthusiastic about what she teaches.",1352
bleam,4,A,LING200,"I took this class as a personal interest and as a CORE.

This class is pretty well organized. There are a multitude of TAs available to help with the class and clarify material. The lectures are available in full to download from ELMS (if I remember correctly) and are very helpful to study from.

There are several exams, quizzes, and some regular homework, but this isn't a hard class to study for. As long as you pay attention to the info and logically understand the concepts, then you will have no issue getting an A.

The material is interesting and pretty logical if you take the time to apply it to the real-world. Makes doing all the work kind of fun.

Overall, this is a great CORE to take. No steep learning curve and decently useful info to know (IMHO).",1352

Not the easiest elective because of all the exercises/homeworks, but super fascinating subject material. Midterm was actually kinda tough for me, but I'd say medium difficulty overall (you have to memorize linguistics concepts and phonology as well as do syntactical analyses of fake languages).

Pretty good choice for an elective! DEFINITELY take the class with Tonia, and you've a good chance of getting an A/B.",1352
bleam,5,A,LING311,Dr. Bleam is an amazing and very down-to-earth person. She keeps class interesting and is accepting to a lot of different ways of doing things.,1352
bleam,5,A,LING240,"(I took this class completely online.) Dr. Bleam is an amazing professor and LING240 is such an interesting class! She's an excellent teacher and her lectures are engaging and helpful. You will need to read articles/studies/experiments for this class but they are always interesting and understandable. The exams match material discussed in lectures and on exercises and homeworks, both in content and difficulty. They definitely supplemented my learning and did not feel like busywork or a waste of time. 
I honestly found the class to be easy and scored very well on the assignments and exams with minimal effort. HOWEVER, my classmates said they found the exams to be somewhat difficult and that the TAs were picky graders, so maybe it depends on whether or not you have a knack for this kind of thing. Either way, getting an A or B is totally doable if you are willing to put in at least a moderate amount of effort. My best piece of advice is to take notes during class AND on the readings. Nothing exhaustive but make sure you have all the key points and some examples. 
I highly recommend this class, especially if you're genuinely interested in linguistics. ",1352

mends-cole_tori,5,A+,COMM107,amazing person. but sometimes forgetful/too busy with her other work. But if you talk to her during class she can always help,1353
mends-cole_tori,1,A-,COMM107,"If you sign up for COMM107 and end up with her, I highly suggest dropping this course within the add/drop period and re-enrolling with a different professor. She projects herself as someone who wants to help her students and teach them how to be great communicators, but within two weeks into the course she reveals her true colors. She is an arrogant, unhelpful, and sometimes even offensive instructor. First of all, she gives very unclear instructions on her assignments and if you email her asking for a clarification, she won't even respond half of the time, giving the vague answer  of ""you should read the syllabus"" (even when the syllabus does not mention anything relevant). And on top of these unclear instructions, she still grades very harshly and hardly even mentions what you did wrong. If you ask her why something was graded the way it was, you will be lucky to get a proper response. She acts as if she is above everyone in the room, as if she has this aura where everyone will look up to her. And if she is running short on time, it doesn't matter if you worked your ass off on an assignment, or if you spent 3 seconds on it, you'll get the same grade. And despite the fact that we are in 2020, she has still makes so many racially insensitive comments in class which she probably thinks are okay just because she herself is a minority too.  Some of you who are reading this will probably think that this review is biased, but I am not the only one who has felt this way about her. I don't know why there aren't more reviews for her on PlanetTerp, but if you type in ""Victoria Mends-Cole"" into RateMyProfessor you will see a much more accurate depiction of who this teacher really is. To summarize this, if you want to avoid trouble your freshman year, just don't take this class",1353
mends-cole_tori,2,A-,COMM107,"I advise not taking COMM107 with her. For one, she would never give written feedback (you had to attend her office hours to find out why you got a certain grade, even though this course was taught online), even after making us wait for several weeks to a month to get a grade on any given assignment. She would also make insensitive comments in class that would make students feel uncomfortable, and often did not respond to questions sent through email. I'll give her some credit for being flexible on deadlines, and I think that some criticism of her is overblown, but I still would not recommend taking this course with her. ",1353
hacquard,3,A,HONR218L,"Hacquard gave a capable and comprehensive survey of the field, with thorough notes. However, her lectures were often slow and a bit monotonous, and the TA was somewhat incomprehensible. Don't be fooled: HONR218L is an introduction to linguistics. If that's what you're looking for, it should be a fine class; otherwise, you're probably signing up for the wrong one.",1354
hacquard,4,A,HONR218L,"I wasn't going to review this until I saw the other two biased reviews, and wanted to make sure the alternate viewpoint could be heard. Coming from someone who knew nothing about linguistics prior to taking this class, after taking it I've now actually declared linguistics as a double major. Sometimes you don't know you like something until you try it, and for me, that's how it was with linguistics.

How do you know if you'd like linguistics, though? As the other reviewers said, if you think this class is going to be a psycholinguistics/cognitive linguistics course, you'll probably be disappointed in 3/4 of the class material. The problem is that as interesting as psycholinguistics is, without a background in general linguistics study you'll be completely lost and unable to really learn much. We do spend a good amount of time learning the things others have mentioned (and Dr. Hacquard herself does research here into those kinds of things), but if you're hard-set on only learning those things and not any intro linguistics, you'd probably be better off looking for something else. 
So if you are interested in those sorts of things, and come in with an open mind, you can really get a lot out of this class. You'll learn more than you will in the general intro linguistics class, in an honors-type classroom setting, and once you have some background, you'll get into those more advanced linguistics topics too.
I found the grading very fair, the exams not easy but again, fairly curved, and lectures compelling - she gives out lecture slides that will ensure you don't have to worry the whole time about taking notes, but you definitely still need to listen because the slides are really just overviews of the lectures themselves.

Plus, an added bonus- if you do find yourself interested in linguistics enough to pursue a major or minor, this class counts as the first class necessary for either.",1354
hacquard,2,A,HONR218L,"This class was not enjoyable at all.  I was interested in how children acquire language and what I basically got was an intro linguistics class, which was not what I bargained for.  The lectures were her reading aloud from a packet given to us; as if we couldn't read it ourselves.  The information was confusing and very difficult to piece together.  The exams were VERY hard, but they are curved, along with the other class grades.  Overall, an extremely boring class, unless you're actually into linguistics.",1354
hacquard,2,,HONR218L,"I did not enjoy this class.  I expected it to be much more about relating language to the mind...the psychology behind acquiring it, differences between species, etc.  However, it mostly focused on the linguistic aspect, which did not interest me.  The lectures were pretty boring and I did not like her teaching style at all.  ",1354
ramsay_gregory,5,A,PLCY101,Super sweet professor!!! he's so nice and genuinely cares about his students! he posts all of the lectures online and the exams are only based on the lectures so you don't really need to go to lecture but you should because he gets sad when people don't. you do need to go to discussion because they take attendance but i had julian and he's super cool and laid back. there are 2 essays 1 exam and the final. the essays are grades easily and fair. don't need to read the textbook really.  ,1367
grimm_robert,3,,HONR349I,"First of all, let me start by saying that Professor Grimm himself is awesome - he is a great lecturer, he is hilarious and very nice.  However, I gave him a 3 because of his philanthropy honors seminar class I took this past semester.

I have taken three years of classes at UMD, and this single honors seminar has been the MOST WORK I HAVE EVER HAD IN ONE CLASS.  

There are about 7 papers to write (and the papers are graded HARSHLY because the TA's are terrible), and you have to schedule many meetings outside of class and go off campus to visit places on the weekends.  

The TA's count how many times you speak in class, and then the top several people who spoke the most gets an A, etc. 

So if you are rather shy or untalkative, you are at a disadvantage.  If you want an A in participation, you need to literally talk over everyone else.

If you are looking for an easy A (or B even), do NOT take this philanthropy class.  End of.

Very few lectures, many outside guests and a focus on what you want to learn and get out of the course. He is great one-on-one and is super helpful. We got to see what other classes taught by other professors did with their projects and ours were by far the best across the board. Some of my friends are taking these projects forward into creating impactful entrepreneurial programs and organizations. Recommended!",1376
egan_toby,5,,HONR348D,"This class is awesome because you get to work on your own portfolio and create social impact with your team. It's a lot of work, but worth it. The instructor is super helpful, but you will have to do a lot on your own--because the ideas are yours. Many helpful out-of-class guests! Worth taking!",1376
egan_toby,5,A,PLCY388D,"He not only helped me and my team figure out a great idea with major social impact, but my team has now won the Do Good Cours e Challenge (his class has won it every year for four or five years) and The Do Good Challenge. Just from being in his class and continuing working on the idea we developed, I have won eight other innovation awards and over $20,000. Great Class, Unbelievable professor. Thank you so much, Dr. Egan!",1376
egan_toby,5,A,HONR348D,"Dr. Egan is great. We were not only Do Good Challenge Finalists right out his class, but my team ended up winning the Do Good Challenge and over $10,000. He helped all of the innovative teams in the class and was really responsive to students--gave lots of feedback and was demanding, but fair. Now with his help, I have a great job and am working in an area that I discovered in his class. Don't miss the chance to take this one!",1376
egan_toby,5,A-,HONR348D,"After this class, I had a team project that made a difference for children in the community and a portfolio that helped me see my impact, plan for my future and share on job interviews. Dr. Egan makes you work for an ""A"", but I can't say I have ever had a class that was more meaningful for me. ",1376
egan_toby,5,A-,BUSO703,"This is a breakthrough class that allows you to connect all of what you want to use from the program into a real project. The professor set us up for success, gave great feedback and coaching when needed. It's entirely team based and depends most on the learners, but the set-up is what makes it work for everyone. He did a great job!",1376
egan_toby,5,A-,PLCY388D,"He did a great job managing a fun and interactive class, even though we were on Zoom for the whole semester! I learned a lot about myself, developed a portfolio about my interests and research on a social problem I care about and am doing new things to make a difference because of this course. Dr. Egan Rocks!",1376
egan_toby,5,,PLCY388D,This was my best class during Covid. Discussion was good. I got to focus on a social issue I care about and the team project was fun. Dr. Egan was very accessible and super supportive. ,1376
egan_toby,5,B+,PLCY388D,Dr. Egan Rocks!,1376

luedtke,5,A+,PLCY201,Amazing professor,1378
luedtke,5,A,PLCY201,"Great guy. Class is very discussion based. Grades based on attendance, 5 quizzes (1 question, short answer response to question), 2 written papers (both very manageable), midterm, and final. Exams are written responses and fair.",1378
luedtke,5,A+,PLCY302,Best professor,1378
tremblay-boire,2,,PLCY388D,"Dr. Tremblay-Boire has good intentions, but can get on your nerves very quickly. She gives very vague responses and her feedback is always lackluster. She constantly finds flaws in whatever work you submit and never gives perfect grades, even on an assignment where all you have to do is introduce yourself. Honestly, she makes you work for the grade, but even if you put in the work, don't expect a good grade because she doesn't like to give those. I would avoid taking her courses for the sake of your own sanity.",1384
sprinkle_robert,1,,,The sustainability department has already found a new professor for this class next semester. It's awful. He's awful. So boring. It's obvious he is a graduate professor. The readings he assigns are ridiculous. Plus the whole class is 3 assignments and a final. God only knows what grade I'll get. ,1385
regan,5,A-,GVPT273,great professor and person. lectures are kind of useless but i still enjoyed going to them. would recommended ,1386
schwab_susan,5,A,,"I took Issues, Challenges and Opportunities in a Globalized World as an honors seminar. I loved the class, but it was probably my hardest course of the semester. Schwab assigns tons of reading and expects students to come to class prepared. There are 4-5 six-page policy memos assigned, which can be kind of hard to get the hang of. I thought this class was fascinating. Professor Schwab really encouraged discussion and debate and respected the students' opinions. She was open to suggestions about how to better conduct the class. I would strongly recommend her as a professor.",1388
fardanesh,4,,BMGT454,He is very nice. His accent can be difficult to understand at times. The class is not that hard if you read the book which is what his tests are based on. He also gives you the pages to read so you don't end up having to read entire chapters. The group project was easy. ,1390
feehan,5,A+,PLCY101,"My favorite professor at UMD. You will never be bored in any of his classes. He will make you think, and question what you think you know. You'll also laugh a lot.",1393
feehan,5,A+,CPPL200,"Lt. Col. Feehan is a great instructor who genuinely cares about the class’s retention of knowledge regarding leadership theory. Also, he tries his best to make sure that the class enjoys learning about that week’s topic. If you have him for CPPL 200, you will have a great time.",1393
hultman,3,B,,"He doesn't expect that much, but he doesn't expect nothing either. Lots of papers that are 2 pages long, but he doesn't normally get upset about them being shorter (closer to a page). One paragraph paper. One long paper (8-10 pages) and a 5 page. He says he is going to change up the class if he teaches it again though. Grading is generally ""harsh"" in the beginning but he says the number grades don't matter. Mostly interested and enthusiastic in class. Good class overall.",1397
hultman,1,,PLCY301,"Professor Hultman is a nice man but this class is poorly structured. For the first 30 minutes of class, it is just him going over changes in the syllabus (yes even after a month of class, he took 30 mins to go over it b/c he included bios of our guest speakers that no one gives af about) and asking us what is going on in the world. I think he has gone over a total of 5 slides and it is halfway through the semester. Furthermore, his slides are vague so its hard to tell what he wants you to know. I have a midterm in two days and no one knows what we are supposed to be studying since the questions are supposedly short essay responses like the homework. Speaking of which, we have had only one homework assignment which he has not even graded yet even though he was supposed to get it to us soon so we know what we are doing wrong! He also assigns a lot of readings that he thinks are ""interesting"" but it really is not; just really tedious and annoying that it's really easy to just ignore.",1397
hultman,3,A+,PLCY301,"This class was a very broad introduction to sustainability, so it covered a lot of different topics within it. Professor Hultman is very passionate about sustainability and this was definitely reflected in his teaching; he was always very enthusiastic and excited to have conversations with the students. The professor would go off on tangents, which were fun and entertaining, but also led to us being behind on a lot of the material. The class is a light workload; other than a research paper at the end, there was only a midterm and a final, and very few assignments in between. The readings were mostly interesting, although they were often long government documents that were hard to sit through. He brought in guest speakers which was interesting. Overall, I learned some things in the class, but I don't feel like it enhanced my knowledge of sustainability much. The class honestly felt like an afterthought to me most of the time. ",1397
hultman,2,,PLCY301,Honestly pretty boring. The first half of the class is spent talking about news stories that aren't relevant to the course material. The midterm is just essay questions that the TAs graded very generously. ,1397
washburn,5,A+,CPPL101,"I have had Professor Washburn for PLCY201 and CPPL101. She is one of the most down-to-earth and enthusiastic people you will meet. The coursework is fair and doable; you can easily get an A in the class as long as you put in the work. She makes the Public Leadership Scholars Program as fun as possible and is always eager to connect with her students during her office hours. If you are a Public Leadership Scholar, you are in good hands.",1406
washburn,5,A+,PLCY201,"Washburn is the absolute best, which you probably know if you're in PL. Classwork is fair and doable, the TAs are helpful, and usually it's interesting. She's also always happy to talk to students and personable is an understatement.",1406
olson_lars,4,B+,AREC241,"Lars was great and very passionate about the course material, but the lectures were very dry and hard to watch. I enjoyed learning from him but he also grades very strictly on papers.",1479
linn_joshua,3,P,AREC456,Very confusing grading policy. ,1482
linn_joshua,5,A,AREC456,"Joshua is a very nice professor, he cares about his students and explains things well. This class is really useful and enjoyable if you find the subject interesting. The materials are not hard, but you need to go to his classes and focus to fully understand the implications of the materials he provided in his slides. Exams are fair, you'll get a good grade if you are familiar with the materials and finish all the assignments.",1482
alberini,1,A,AREC382,"I made my first ourumd account to write this review especially for her! 
You will not find out that she is racist until the middle of semester! My friend told me before that she is sexist and racist, and I regretted that I did not believe my friend.
She gives extra care to American students during class, and she is also extremely approachable after class for American students.        
BUT! IF YOU ARE A FOREIGN STUDENT, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!   You will not get the same amount of help compared to others, and you will NEVER get the chance to ask her questions after class. 
She does not have official office hours and she will ask you to send her email requesting for office hour and SHE RARELY REPLIES!!!! 
She is also capable of intentionally ignoring you during class. 
The worst thing is that even you do the homework correctly, she can curve you down!!!!!",1485
alberini,1,A,AREC382,"Her class is easy, but she continues to use outdated data for many years. She does not have office hours, and it is extremely hard to make an appointment with her. She is too busy to help her students. ",1485
alberini,1,,AREC382,"TERRIBLE professor! She uses outdated data for nearly ten years and some of the command even cannot find on the excel 2007. The world is changing however she keeps her assignment sheets as they were ten years ago. She does not have office hours and she is extremely unaccessible. When you make an appointment with her to discuss the homework, she can let you wait outside her office for nearly one hour, and then she rushed out of her office and leave a work to you--I have to go, I have class! This makes you really disappointed. She values her time, but she never value your time. She also doesn't respect her students. She is too busy to help her students. ",1485
alberini,5,A,AREC382,Great professor! Very easy class if you keep up and ask her for help. Highly recommend the class especially if you're an AREC major.,1485
alberini,1,A,AREC382,"She is TERRIBLE!!!!!Her class is super easy. While making you confidence on getting an A in this class, she is capable of CURVING DOWN your grade. Unbelievable!",1485
alberini,1,A,AREC382,She is still using outdated things like overhead projector and the content is disorganized mess. ,1485
alberini,5,A,AREC382,"This is an interesting class, even if you're not an AREC major.  You'll learn about the functions of Excel to answer different questions about economics and agriculture.

Dr. Alberini is very nice and very helpful.  Don't be afraid to ask for help because she is approachable and wants her students to succeed.",1485
spivy,5,A,ENSP101,"Very passionate about what she teaches. Really kind and cares for her students. Offers a few extra credit assignments which helped me clutch an A.

Show up and participate in class to get all the discussion points. There are few homework assignments but those are to help you with your final paper. She gives really good feedback. There is also a final group presentation but that is slight work since it is based on your paper.",1490
spivy,5,,ENSP101,"I think anyone interested in the environment will really enjoy this class, but also people who don't really care that much for environmental issues. She has a down to earth personality and makes her lectures interesting. It's easy to follow her explanations and she thoroughly explains the concepts. You can tell she has a strong background in this field, but she's able to breaks things down to make sense. Even if you're majoring in something else I think you'd enjoy a class with her. The work load is also pretty chill.",1490
spivy,5,A,ENSP101,She is so sweet and her tests are fairly straightforward. I am taking her online due to covid and her lectures are not too bad. i enjoy the class and the conversations about the environment are golden def recommend. The class is also fairly easy. ,1490
spivy,5,A,ENSP101,"During COVID, all her classes were her going through her Powerpoints and explaining the concepts. Even though I highly recommend you take notes as she's talking (so that you don't miss any explanations), she still provides the powerpoints online after going through them. The only homework is working on the final paper and a few readings for discussion section. The textbook is helpful if you want additional notes, but I never used it and it was fine. All of the exam questions are straight-forward and have been taught in class, there's no big surprises. Overall, she's very understanding and really friendly, and a good professor as well. I definitely recommend taking her class!",1490
spivy,5,A+,ENSP101,Excellent teacher! Cares about her students and offers lots of extra credit ,1490
spivy,5,A+,ENSP101,"Took her class during COVID here, she is a very down to earth person and if you want a easy GenEd course to take, this is it! Homeworks are straight forward and the final is a paper. Tests are also very straight forward and you can use open note slides to easy do them. She also offers extra credit which gave me an A+ in the class",1490
spivy,5,A+,ENSP101,Fantastic teacher that rewards interest.,1490
spivy,5,A+,ENSP101,Great professor! Easy to understand the material. Tests are logical and fit the material. She also provides many opportunities for extra credit. ,1490
pavao-zuckerman_mitchell,5,A-,ENST360,Dr. P-Z is super nice and apporachable. The class content and grading structure is straight forward and he tries to make it as easy as possible. Currently taught asynchronous lectures with synchronous discussion sections. The concepts overlap with BSCI207 if you are an ecosystem health concentration. ,1491
boules,5,B+,PLCY301,"She is a really amazing professor! She is so sweet and has a very positive energy in class. Her assignments are not too challenging and teach you a lot about climate change. She is very accommodating and understanding about things like extensions and whatnot. I did not get the best grade in her class, but if you put in the work you'll probably end up at a high B or an A. She also loves to show her cats to the class!",1498
mays-williams,5,,INAG110,"Professor Mays-Williams is great. For one, she don't want you to fail the class. She tells you the first day of class what you need to do to get an A. She's very fair while grading the speeches and if you ask her she'll explain how you can improve.
She loves, loves, loves participation in class. I think it makes a bit sad when we don't participate. She keeps the class interesting with little games sometimes. I really don't like public speaking but prof mays makes the class bearable.
All in all, i'll advice everyone to take her class.",1503
mays-williams,2,A,INAG110,"The class is easy, but she is not really a good teacher. She is extremely vague on assignment details/due dates and often contradicts herself. It also seems like she constantly just pulls assignments out of her ass, as a lot of them are assigned last minute and don't make much sense. That being said, it is still easy to get an A, especially if you know how to b.s. for those stupid assignments or when she calls on you in class discussion.",1503
mays-williams,1,A,INAG110,"To her credit, Prof. Mays-Williams is very kind and seems very knowledgeable about the content of the textbook she teaches. However, to put it simply, she is not good at teaching. She often gives incredibly vague instructions for assignments, and when asked to clarify, either gives a more confusing answer or contradicts herself. Also, she very clearly pulls assignment ideas out of thin air, which results in a lot of our assignments being not well thought out and therefore tough to complete properly. That being said, if you're willing to just keep your head down and power through the confusion, it's not very difficult to get a good grade.",1503
mays-williams,5,,INAG110,Mays-Williams is such a caring and nice professor and really fun to talk to! Her assignments can be a little confusing but she's an easy grader. ,1503
mays-williams,4,,INAG110,The other reviews are right in saying that Mays-Williams has pretty confusing assignments/instructions sometimes but our discussions in class are always interesting and she's an easy grader. I'd advise you to take this class if you're willing to power through the confusion of the assignments and she's a really understanding and nice person! ,1503
mays-williams,3,A,INAG110,"She is not a very effective teacher in that, because of COVID, we didn't have any lectures and she didn't do a great job explaining assignments before they were due. I got most of my answers from the class groupme instead of from the Professor, which is not great, but it is also not a very hands on class.
I took this class with her because the grading distribution was good and I thought I could just get an easy A for my GenEd. That's exactly what happened. The discussions are definitely interesting, but she was not too involved in them except asking a few questions. There are only a few assignments, she is an easy grader, and generally it is not hard to get a good grade in the class with a medium amount of effort. I'd recommend for anyone looking to knock out their oral comm credit ",1503
mays-williams,4,,INAG110,"Very relatable and nice professor that gives an expected workload. She sometimes has miscommunications about assignment due dates and grading, but aside from that, I would recommend her for INAG110.",1503
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,"Dr. Hakenkamp was an awesome professor. I took her class over winter break because I had to drop BStat with a W or I was going to fail. I suck at math, but she's a great teacher. Biom301 over winter break is the easiest thing i've ever done at UMD. Her homework assignments are fast, mostly true and false questions. Our final exam was optional if you wanted to boost your grade. If you need a super easy math or stat class take this with her",1504
hakenkamp,3,A,BIOM301,"She's pretty goofy, but you can tell she is obviously into the material. Her tests were reasonable, but often she'd throw on questions that were really backwards to confuse us. I hated that. I wish she would  test us on the material and not try to confuse us. You have to read every word of her test questions and expect her to be tricking you. Overall, class is meh.",1504
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,"she knows exactly how to teach the course, so just do what she says and you can't go wrong",1504
hakenkamp,3,A,BIOM301,"Not a hard class, but you do have to put in some work if you want to get an A, and not an A-.
There are 4 exams and a final, along with online quizzes, discussion assignments, and a group project (which was fairly easy). The final is optional, so try and do well on the exams, which aren't too hard.
Hakenkamp is a pretty boring lecturer, but she does give you quite a few resources to draw from--all lecture powerpoints are posted online, and most of her lecture audio was recorded and posted online as well in case you missed a class. She also posts practice exam questions and practice exams as well, so if you do all of those you should be in good shape for the exams.
All in all, not a bad class, if you like statistics in general then you'll probably like this class.",1504
hakenkamp,4,A-,BIOM301,"like the previous reviewer said, it's not a super easy class; it's just not as hard as other 300 level science classes, for example. You need to put in the work for the grade. In case you wanted to know, the final was about the same difficulty as the 4 midterms, but you should try your best not to have to take it and just score well on the midterms.",1504
hakenkamp,2,,BIOM301,"Discussion brings up your grade so you have to go. Definately do all the quizzes and discussion assignments. 
Hakenkamp got really old to me during the first month. First she was okay but then I started to hate her. She spoke too fast and no one paid attention in class. You can't really take notes during class, you have to take time to review the powerpoints in your own time. Her exams are easy - if you study reasonable amount you could get at least a B easily. Their is a group project - seriously she doesn't want a lot of effort into it - my group put a lot of effort and our result was a B because one of our sections was too long.
Take BIOM301 only because its an easy A, not because of reviews about Hakenkamp",1504
hakenkamp,4,A,BIOM301,"This really isnt that hard of a course and its not that much work. Theres a discussion weekly where you have to do an assignment, and a quiz every week.  They're pretty easy. Theres a research assignment at the end that you do as a group which is pretty easy.

4 exams, 150 each, final is optional. pretty easy if you study. 

teacher isnt bad, but she just reads from the ppt. I stopped going to class after the first couple weeks and still did fine on the tests. just read the slides before you take the test. ",1504
hakenkamp,3,A,BIOM301,"This class isn't difficult, and its not a ton of work. Attendance is required for discussion. Weekly discussion homework and online quizzes, but she drops the lowest. 4 in class exams--true/false is usually the hardest part of the exams. She likes true/false questions. 

There's a group project worth the same as an exam. The groups are large, so its not a ton of work individually.

She runs through lecture very quickly each time, so you are usually done early, but its almost impossible to keep up with her for notes. Almost all the info you need is on the slides, which she uploads. She also tries to record and upload lectures.",1504
hakenkamp,4,B+,BIOM301,"pretty easy class. first exam is the easiest so make sure you do really good on it. it gets a bit tricker for the next exams. final is optional and i don't recommend taking it. 
she speeds through lectures so you always get out early.
she always seems to be in a rush but she is helpful in office hours",1504
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,"This course is a breeze. I took it over winter break which I highly recommend if you have the opportunity. Dr. Hakenkamp is great, she is very bubbly and nice and I enjoyed having her as a professor. There were three exams for the class, but since I took it over winter break there was no final, just three noncumulative exams. There are also discussion assignments, which you can usually get 100% on. I had Melissa as my TA, and she was awesome. And there are online homework assignments/quizzes. The material is not too difficult. There are a lot of equations and statistical tests, but you are given a cheat sheet for each exam that includes all the formulas you will need. Spend a decent amount of time studying and you will get an A. ",1504
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,"This class is easy as heck.
Just study the powerpoints, and you can essentially skip all the classes.
If you took AP Statistics in high school, then you will realize that this is essentially all of the same material.
I pretty much had to study a night or two before each mid-term, and I did well.
You get lots of easy points by doing discussion worksheets and ELMS quizzes. You have the option of not taking the final if you did well enough on the mid-terms and are satisfied with your scores.",1504
hakenkamp,3,AB,BIOM301,"It was impossible to take notes in this class. The powerpoints were too long and she went too quickly for it to be possible. The material is not particularly difficult, but you'll probably learn the best by doing practice problems out of the book, and by going to discussion.  There are good examples provided in the slides though, so they are a good reference for when you're doing any of the assignments.  ",1504
hakenkamp,3,A,BIOM301,Dr. Hakenkamp teaches at a lightning fast speed which can be frustrating for those who are not great with math.  However she does provide a lot of resources to help students succeed and she is available outside of lecture. Going to discussion is crucial to passing this course.  Almost all assignments are completed during discussion. The class is easier to take during the winter session because there is no research project and tests are given closer together when the information is fresh in your mind.,1504
hakenkamp,3,C,BIOM301,"Do go to discussion...and also study very very well for her exams, they can be tricky..and do well in the online quizzes..there is a group project that can also help your grade do well in everything and good luck with the final..it was def tricky..overall she was an okay teacher the final exam messed me up :(",1504
hakenkamp,1,B,BIOM301,Professor was not up to par.  Too many slides to articulate basic information.  Wording was tricky on the weekly quiz and true false questions.  Its not hard.. she just makes it really annoying!,1504
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,Very nice professor. exams are straightforward: problems are easy but multiple choice can be tricky. discussion is easy but mandatory. project is easy but a pain.  ,1504
hakenkamp,5,A,BIOM301,"I had two courses about statistics before this one and she was the best stat professor. She keeps it simple but fun and relevant, which is hard to do with statistics. The exams are challenging, the labs are good practice, and the project is a lot of fun. Go to class, go to labs, and practice for exams should get you an A.   ",1504
hakenkamp,3,A,BIOM301,"This is a basic stats class applied to biology.  The first test is literally about mean, median and mode which makes it pretty easy.  It gets a little harder from then on but as long as you go to most of the classes and do the work in discussion it shouldnt be too bad.  There is one group project and as with all group projects you may get stuck with people that dont quite carry their weight, but even so the project isnt too bad and she grades them fairly easily.  As long as you look over the notes and look at her examples and practice exams it should be an easy class.  ",1504
hakenkamp,5,A+,BIOM301,"Dr. Hakenkamp was probably the MOST accommodating professor I've had at UMD. She had all of her lectures recorded online in case you couldn't attend them, she had a grade buffer on the quizzes and discussion, making it really easy to get a good grade. If you complete the quizzes, discussion, and watch the lectures, this class is an easy A. And the final is optional, which is an added bonus since I would guess most students in the class had an A- at the very least by the end of the semester.",1504
hakenkamp,4,A,BIOM301,She is a really good teacher. I took this class winter semester and it went fast but it was very manageable. She is extremely organized and her expectations were clear. She did a 200 max out of 240 points for the quizzes and discussion assignments so you could lose 40 points and still get a 100% on those sections. The exams were very reasonable and open note (but this was COVID and winter semester so might be different for other semesters). She had a lot of review sessions and office hours. She is very helpful and teaches well. ,1504
dunning,5,A,INAG110,Entertaining and very reasonable workload,1505
dunning,5,A+,INAG110,"Eric Dunning is absolutely the best professor to take for INAG110. His lectures are fun, and if you have him on Tuesday/Thursday for the hour and fifteen minute time, you will always get out early. He likes to come in, get things done, and get out. 

There are a lot of in-class exercising that are simple, goofy and fun to help with public speaking and speech structure skills. His grading of speeches is straightforward and he will always give you feedback if you want it. The lowest grade on any speech in my class during the semester was a 92, so you will do well.

He does have a midterm and a final, which are basically extra points, They are based on the chapters from the book which are super simple and it is basically a glorified vocab test. Most people studied the day or or the night before and did great.

He does have pop quizzes for the readings, so going to class is important, but you can also predict when they are going to be, but class is fun so you might as well go. For the pop quizzes, if you look over the vocab at the end of the chapter right before class, you will be set.",1505
dunning,5,A,INAG110,"Very easy grader when it comes to speeches. He gives pop quizzes, often at very inconvenient times (for our semester, he gave a pop quiz before the midterm, and after the midterm), so make sure that you're ready for those. The quizzes are just vocab, so if you read through the chapters, and learn the vocab, you should be fine (he pulls from headers and bolded words FYI). I ended up getting caught off-guard by a couple quizzes, so if you find yourself in this situation, Dunning will give extra-credit if you wright an essay for him, so it's still not so bad. Otherwise, he's very engaging and fun to take, so I highly recommend",1505
dunning,5,A,INAG110,"Dr. Dunning is a really chill professor. He's laid back, a little funny, and seemed to adapt well to online learning. There isn't much work in the class, but you do have to read the textbook, or at least skim it, as there are pop quizzes based on the reading. If you have to take an FSOC class(which you do), I wouldn't tell anyone not to take him.",1505
tilley,5,,ENST281,"Great guy! Very straightforward with the information and his expectations, and the final exam was super easy. I wish more of the class was devoted to his portion.",1513
tilley,3,A,ENST405,"He's super chill and nice, but I feel wholly unprepared for the content. He does calculations on the board, but it's very messy and hard to follow. A lot of the students and I are very lost on the actual math most of the time. The textbook he assigned was super hard to read and a lot of the main content at the start of the course was dependent on that. ",1513
larson_shala,5,A,INAG110,"She's a great professor and she doesn't grade harshly. She's very straightforward with her assignments and there are a couple of chapter quizzes and weekly discussions. However the exams and quizzes are open note so it's easy. 
She gives very detailed feedback for oral speeches and all the speeches are extemporaneous style with just an outline. I definitely recommend her for this course. ",1520
larson_shala,4,A-,INAG110,"Overall she's a very nice and good professor. If you take her class you can definitely get an A. She gives good feedback on speeches and is a fair grader. However, for the first few weeks it was hard to find the zoom links and sometimes the discussion posts wouldn't be posted until a day or two before the due date. Again, overall she's a good professor, but a bit unorganized at times.",1520
baballari,1,A-,ENST200,"This professor is nice to her students, but it doesn't really help with her class structure / teaching style. When asked a question, she usually doesn't give a great answer. Her lectures go really fast and they're also pretty boring. The worst part is her exams -- no one ever knows how to prepare because she says to skim the textbook, but then there will be really crazy questions on the exam that you wouldn't know just from lecture. Then there's even questions you wouldn't know at all from this class' content. She will also put questions from other units into the exam you're taking even though it is not cumulative, or relevant to the current unit. She has a test bank that she takes from so some students can get really hard questions that involve a lot of math and so take more time, but others will get simpler ones. The fact that everything is multiple choice makes it really hard because her opinion on the ""best"" answer choice can be a bit confusing. Overall, it's a very unbalanced class and has been unnecessarily difficult.",1521
lichtenberg,4,A,AREC453,"Extremely boring lectures with little class interaction and overly wordy power point slides that don't necessarily convey much useful knowledge.  Seems standoffish, but really he's a very nice professor who will help you understand the formulas or other material if you ask.

He provides midterm and final exam study guides on what you're expected to know; make sure you understand everything on these study guides and you'll do well.  For the quizzes, search key phrases in the PDF notes and you can finish them quickly.",1523
lichtenberg,4,A,AREC453,"Prof. Lichtenberg is a very knowledgable professor despite his lectures sometimes diverging into dryness.  He may seem stand-offish to most but if you ask for help he is very accommodating.  The term paper for the class is pretty hard, but he gives you a lot of help along the way.  Overall, good class and good professor.",1523
chambers_robert,5,B,AREC405,"Super professor and class! Highly recommend it. Very engaging and Prof. Chambers is extremely helpful. Don't feel stupid asking questions because he genuinely wants to help. One of the best classes and teachers.
Course work isn't impossible but don't slack off on studying. Lecture is mandatory, but engaging. He will call you out in class if you break any sort of rules and it's honestly a rite of passage. Enjoy it and don't let it get to you. You'll learn everyone's last names and it's a wonderful class. Learn a lot and understand economics a lot better.",1524
chambers_robert,4,B,AREC405,"Class was great, the exams were easy and he went through everything so that it was hard not to understand what he was asking on the exam. Awesome teacher! just dont yawn or come late to his class or he will YELL at you and put you on the spot infront of the entire class.",1524

zaki_mary,1,,AREC250,"quite possibly the worst teacher for an economics class, especially if it’s your first time taking one. online was very difficult and stressful. Lectures were also not recorded. While a very nice lady who would take her time to try and listen to what was confusing students and help, her explanations were just not good. Nice person, not a great teacher. Also barely any assignments were put in which is unfortunate to try and get better grades. ",1528
mchale,5,A-,ENGL101,Great teacher. She is a fair grader and actually tries to improve your writing. I wish she would diversify her in class readings though since every article we read was about women/feminism. ,1530
mchale,5,A,,"Great professor! I had her for British Literature. The class was A LOT of reading (5 novels and some short stories), but the pieces we read weren't that bad. Only 2 papers the whole semester, and she is very helpful if you have trouble writing the papers.
Going to lectures is a must! There are quizzes on most of the pieces we read, but if you actually read the piece then the quizzes are pretty easy. Lecture can be a bit boring, but it really helps with understanding the text and preparing for the final.
Overall, not a bad HL class.",1530
mchale,4,A,ENGL101,"The course itself is not particularly enjoyable, as it involves several papers and a pretty good amount of busy work, but Professor McHale is a pretty good professor!

She's SUPER liberal, which I loved, but she openly admits it and she's never offensive about it. I felt that sometimes she beat a dead horse with a stick, and class drug on, but in general the class isn't too bad. The class is really interactive, and she's got a nerdy, fun sense of humor. But prepare to wait a longgg time to get your paper graded and returned to you.

Engl101 is a hard course to get an A in because the university wants students to take Junior English, so she was a tough grader, but it's definitely possible to get an A. ",1530
mchale,5,B+,ENGL101,"Her class was my most enjoyable class this semester. She has a sense of humor which makes the class fun, but she expects students to work hard. The work load is not quite as fun as the class; however, all of the English101 classes are tough. 
She is not an easy grader though she is a fair grader.  ",1530
hamza,2,,ANSC327,"The course is not as difficult as it seems, and that is precisely my problem with Dr. Hamza. Most professors in Animal science try to make things seem more attainable to understand, meanwhile Dr. Hamza seems to get some weird enjoyment out of thinking basic techniques need to be trumped up into something we'd all have trouble understanding. He is smug and pretentious and his attitude is insulting to everyone's intelligence. He will push you to think, but there is not one class where I didn't find him to be condescending. He is incredibly smart, but at what cost? He's rude and often intimidating to approach. ",1532
hamza,5,A+,ANSC327,"As stated below, Hamza's class is definitely difficult, but he is not a bad professor, he is not mean, he does not want his students to fail. These are all things I had previously heard before taking his class, and it scared the crap out of me.

However, Dr. Hamza is really eager to help his students learn and fall in love with genetics, while discovering their critical thinking abilities, as long as the students are able to put in the effort.

This class really allowed me to become involved with the lecture. It is one of those classes where,  if you miss a lecture or doze off, you've missed something really valuable. Dr. Hamza often engages students with questions (even though he calls people out and the questions are sometimes difficult), but he really just wants to get his students to think critically and to learn, not just memorize information to regurgitate on exams and then forget about it a few months later.

I definitely recommend this course, but be prepared to put in the work.",1532
hamza,5,A,ANSC327,"Yes, Dr. Hamza is a difficult teacher. Yes, the material is hard. And yes, at first, the class can seem intimidating. However, Dr. Hamza is eager and more than willing to help students learn and discover their learning capability if YOU are willing to put in the work and make an effort! 

Dr. Hamza's class is one of the few classes that required me to engage in the class instead of just passively taking notes- and because of this, I still remember many of the principles he taught in class. It might not have been the ""easy"" thing at the time, but this has helped me tremendously as I continued my education. It also made me a more active and curious learner. 

Do not be afraid to speak up during class! Dr. Hamza might ask you challenging questions back, but he is doing it for your own good, not to embarrass you. And quite honestly, most of the people in the class, if not all, probably have the same questions as you do. I constantly asked questions, and I sincerely believe that is one of the reasons that I enjoyed the course as much as I did. 

The class is presented via easy to follow power points. I found exams to be extremely fair. If you listen in class, take detailed notes (don't just rely on the power point slides), and ask insightful questions to clarify points, the exams will be straight forward.

This is a great course- easily my favorite in the animal science curriculum- as long as you come engaged and willing to learn! Dr. Hamza truly wants to see his students succeed and is a great mentor- you just have to show that you WANT to learn. ",1532
hamza,5,B+,ANSC327,"Hamza will probably scare you at first because he is extremely intelligent and intimidating. BUT he is an awesome, passionate teacher. He hates teachers who make students memorize stuff and just regurgitate it on tests. His teaching style forces you to gain a deep understanding of the material. 

Advice: REVIEW MATERIAL FROM THE PREVIOUS LECTURE. Every day, he asked us questions about the last lecture, and I felt stupid when i didnt get the answer right. Just make daily genetics review a part of your routine. 

For tests: textbook is a helpful supplement, but focus on his powerpoint slides. GO to his office hours as often as possible. He is great at explaining stuff and drawing pictures until you get it, and he is more than willing to help. 

All in all, this class was awesome and taught me how to apply the concepts to real life. Id rather get a B+ in this class knowing I worked my butt off and actually understood the material than get an A+ in a class that only involved memorizing words and spitting them out on tests. 

Dont take anything Hamza says personally. He's hard on his students because he likes to push us and knows we can succeed. He's passionate about genetics and teaching as a whole.  ",1532
hamza,4,B,ANSC327,"Dr. Hamza scared the bejeezus out of me in the beginning of the semester. He stressed me out and I really 'hated his guts' (as he would say). The way he randomly calls out students can be very stressful and demeaning. I felt like a total idiot more than once in this class for my inability to answer a simple question because I was so freaked out from being called on (my heart rate would seriously spike). He makes it very difficult to get away with saying ""I don't know."" 

- On the plus side, if he asks you a question and you can't answer it, he will make you feel so bad about it that you will never forget the answer...and I suppose that's one effective method of teaching.
...When students don't know the answer to something, he likes to tell us that we're breaking his heart. This is about the nicest thing he will say to you if you can't answer one of his questions.

Anyway, he has grown on me throughout the semester. He says his exams are very challenging, but I was pleasantly surprised by his first exam - I expected it to be completely ridiculous, but it was actually very fair. (He gives an exam - 25%, Siewerdt gives an exam - 25%, there are pop quizzes - 25%, and a final - 25%). 

I found his material VERY interesting, but I was not so intrigued by Siewerdt's material. However, Siewerdt is incredibly nice and was a huge relief to have in the classroom - you could feel the stress levels in the room drop when he was teaching. ",1532
archsmith,5,A-,AREC380,"He gives detailed power point and talks really fast but clearly each lecture. Sometimes we have problemset which is not really difficult as long as I listen to him carefully in class. His exams are more about concept and explanation. Once you review all his power points and problemset answer sheet, you could get a fine grade. 
He's really nice and patient when I asked questions even though some of them were really really basic and easy.",1533
archsmith,5,A,AREC380,"Very chill professor. The class focuses more on principles than coding skills so it is great for people who have no experience in coding. Though the class is not easy, I am glad that I took it because it is very useful and it introduces you to the world of data science. Slides are really detailed and Professor Archsmith provides R code for every lecture, which is extremely helpful for the homework and projects. ",1533

goger,4,A-,ENSP400,"Easy, sort of a pushover. Very interested in policy, obviously. Her tests are a breeze. Values participation and attendance, but it won't make or break your grade. Take advantage of extra credit if you want an A+, I guess. ",1542

yonkos,5,A,ENST233,"Professor Yonkos is awesome.  The class is extremely straightforward and moderately interesting.  Theres a ton of content each unit (the book isn't necessary, just go to lecture and discussion), but the tests are easy if you know the big picture concepts and pretty much follow his study guides word for word.  The group research project (7-10 page paper and group presentation) is annoying but they grade it very leniently.  Definitely take this class if you're an environmental studies student looking for an elective",1556
yonkos,5,B,ENST233,"Professor Yonkos is amazing. You can tell he really cares about his students. He was always positive and energetic. Although the information for this class could be tedious to get through, he always tried to make it interesting.
His office hours were by appointment so I was hesitant to make an appointment if I only had one question, therefore I never did. However I wish I did because he seems like a great professor to have a connection with for references and whatnot.

Onto the class itself. I'll admit I didn't try hard at all in this class, yet I still managed to get a B (83.3%). I attended lectures for the first third of the semester then stopped because he put his lectures online (however I rarely looked at them). For the exams, the only studying I did was look at the google doc based on the review sheets he provided. I never even purchased the book and everything on the exam, he had on his slides so if you want to save money, don't bother buying it.
The class had three exams--2 midterms and a cumulative final (which was mainly content from the last third of the semester, then ~5 repeat questions from the first two exams). I got a 78%, 84%, and 74% respectively.

Onto discussion. Discussion is mandatory; you receive participation points for attending/reading assigned texts prior to it. There are small (2-3 questions) pop quizzes based on discussion readings assigned. However, these weren't posted on ELMS so I think they're just factored into your TA's opinion on whether you were doing your job or not. The discussion readings were interesting and discussion was fun when people were actively engaged. I got a 4/5, though I only ever said one thing in that class.
There was also a 7-10 paged research paper and a group presentation based on it to do. Never been fond of writing--I complain when I have to write more than 2 pages. I got a 90% on it with most points taken off for formatting, so don't worry about it; especially if your topic is interesting (your group gets to select). Got a 91.5% on the group presentation as a group and a 92.5% as an individual with little preparation so don't sweat that either.

Overall, this class is great, especially with Yonkos. If you actually attend class and go over notes, you'll likely get an A.",1556
yonkos,4,A,ENST233,"Yonkos is an overall solid professor. ENST 233 was far from challenging but he did what he could to make it interesting. If you need a GPA booster, this class is a good choice.",1556
yonkos,5,A+,ENST233,"I love Dr. Yonkos! He's approachable, friendly, and can be funny. His lectures are a bit boring but he does try hard to make the material interesting - most of it is.

Unfortunately most of this class is straight-up memorization. I got an A+ by going to lectures (though he does post slides online) and just memorizing the concepts on the study guides he gives out for every test, including the final.

Discussion is a bore but oh well. Don't worry about the 7-10 page term paper - usually your topic is mildly interesting so it's not too hard to write. Anyone who honestly tried hard got an A in my class.

DO NOT buy the book for this class. It is USELESS. You will never, ever use it and he will never, ever test you on what's in it, though he encourages you to read it. It's incredibly dry and uninformative.",1556
yonkos,5,A+,ENST233,"Most of the reviews are pretty accurate. He cares about whether students are learning or not and he is very energetic and appears to be enthusiastic about the subject. His slides have a lot of information and yes he does post all of it online, however taking notes on what he says in class or paying attention makes the difference between an A and a B. 

The class is a decent amount of work, but it is graded fairly leniently. 15minute group presentation, 7page research paper, 3 easy tests, random attendance quizzes and discussion is a waste of time. I recommend doing the discussion readings so that you can enjoy that class since participation is mandatory.

",1556
yonkos,5,B,ENST233,"I agree with everything that has been said by the others. Yonkos is a really good guy, and ENST233 was very interesting. 

He packs a lot into his powerpoints, so that can be a bit of an issue when it comes to studying for the test. Still, I really enjoyed the class and recommend it to those who don't care much for the sciences. I really learned a lot. ",1556
yonkos,5,B,ENST233,"The professor is a decent guy--get to know him and he'll teach you lots! He's one of the most approachable instructors on campus. He actually cares about whether or not kids learn a thing or two from his lectures. Very understanding. 

He's a great speaker, enjoyed listening to his presentations, but his teaching style overall is a bit bland. Taught straight from the slides (and graciously posted them up after every class)--which was both good and bad. Good because it's a straightforward study tool. Bad because it didn't excite me as much as I would have liked. 

In general, test averages ranged from B+ - A-. Half of the final grade is based on a group presentation graded by fellow discussion members and TA. 

Not a bad experience, just didn't like the course content itself--focused too much on problems/theory and not enough on solutions. Also, the main evidence for most of the claims were based on ""biased statistics"" (the professor's exact words); pretty disappointing. 

But, if you need a class to boost your GPA, take one with Professor Yonkos. ",1556
yonkos,5,A,ENST233,"This class is pretty straightforward, and Dr. Yonkos is a nice professor.  He puts his Powerpoint slides online, which is nice, but I still recommend you attend lecture because then the slides make more sense and it helps reinforce the material.

The material itself isn't too challenging.  There are three exams-two midterms and a final, with the final being cumulative-though Dr. Yonkos does provide review sheets for the exams.  The exams consist of a combination of multiple choice and short answer/definitions.  Some of the questions can be somewhat tricky, but Dr. Yonkos is pretty generous with the grading, so no need to worry too much.  If you pay attention in class and study, you should be fine.

In addition to the exams, there is a group project (later in the semester) involving a presentation and a paper-as well as the fact that you have to attend the other presentations (for participation grade).  The group projects aren't terribly difficult, and even though Prof. Yonkos decides the groups, you still have a choice of topic.  My advice would be not to procrastinate and to just try to be as fair as possible when dividing up the work.

All in all, this should be a good, straightforward class.  I took it purely as an elective, although many students in the class take it as an ENST requirement.  The class covers a lot of different topics on a general, basic level, but nontheless, it's interesting, relevant, and important material especially in regards to current environmental issues.

Good luck!",1556
yonkos,5,A,ENST233,"Dr. Yonkos is great. He's a very effective lecturer (keeps it interesting and tells you just a little bit more than you need to know). Also, his exams are pretty easy as long as you pay attention to the class-- the book won't help you much if at all because he tests based off of his lectures. The discussion was a little boring, but my TA did her best. The paper isn't that bad; as long as you don't obviously add fluff, you should get an easy A on it.I spent a solid 3 hours on a 9 page paper and got a 98.",1556
yonkos,5,A+,ENST233,Dr. Yonkos is an amazing professor. He clearly explains the concepts and uses his time wisely. He takes up the entire class time but he doesn't require a textbook. So he uses up all his time to cover everything so we don't need to take time outside of class to read a textbook. He adapted well to the online environment. He cares about his students and is willing to work with them. I liked the class a lot because I learned a lot and it wasn't stressful. I would take another one of his classes if I could. I recommend taking his class over another professor if there is one.,1556
preonas,5,,AREC422,"Louis is knowledgeable (He loves what he teaches), understanding, humorous, and engaging. The course is harder than the other AREC classes I've taken, but it is definitely useful and interesting to learn, especially for AREC majors. The assignments are meaningful, giving us a chance to look at real-world analyses done by economists. I must say Louis is a really good professor, and it's a pity that we have to take this class online.",1558
rabenhorst,5,A,ENST430,"Dr. Rabenhorst is an excellent professor.  He makes sure we all stay awake in lecture by asking a lot of questions.  He also emails us print-outs for every lecture that are basically fill-in-the-blanks with all of the stuff you need to know for quizzes and exams.
If you don't like getting dirty, don't take this class, because the lab can get pretty messy when you go out in the field.",1561
mclean,5,A,ANSC447,"The lab she taught was tough but in my opinion very fair. It was informative, interesting and i learned a lot. It is not easy but it was high quality. She was a fair grader and helped students out and did a good job at explaining. The class couldve been handled more efficiently but it works",1563
mclean,5,A-,ANSC103,Overall a good professor and wants students to succeed. I do wish she had some more reference resources available especially for breeds of animals. If I ever needed anything though she or her TAs would put something together to help with studying. ,1563
mclean,3,B+,ANSC103,Not a fan of hers. When it came to hard math stuff she was very disorganized and notes were all over the place..not the best at explaining stuff...not terrible though. ,1563
vanklompenberg,1,C-,ANSC214,"She is literally the worst professor ever with no empathy or willingness to take constructive criticisms. Her manners & words towards students are extremely passive, condescending, and petty. She always confuses herself with the discussions in class and conflicts herself with info from the book. She makes you do drawings with her in class despite everyone's complaint about it not really helping them learn. ",1564
whent,4,A,NFSC220,"Dr. Whent is definitely knowledgeable in this field. Her PowerPoints were very helpful and clearly displayed what was needed for the exams. Also, her class activities are pretty fun and easy. The one knock I would have on her is that some lectures were boring, as she sometimes just read from them without adding much. Other than that, she was great and the class was an easy A.  ",1565
sahyoun,4,B,NFSC100,"She was a very nice professor. Not the best professor, but out of the 4 professors I had, she was the ""best"". Presented her slides well and answered questions well.",1567
sahyoun,3,A,NFSC100,"It really doesn't matter what professor you have in this class because you will be taught by all 4 of them. They all do the same thing where they just read off the lecture slides, which are posted online before class. However, it is important to go to class because there are a total of 5 pop quizzes that are extra credit that will boost your grade a lot. This is a pure memorization class, so the exams can be tricky. It almost all multiple choice that's 2 point each, so it's easy to loose points quickly if you don't pay attention to every little detail on the powerpoints. They do posts study guides for the exams, but those only cover a portion of what will be on the exam. To study for exams, its best to do the study guides and memorize the slides by making quizlets. Sometimes nobody gets a 100% on the exams, but the class is not curved, so whatever you get is the real score. There are a good amount of discussion worksheets that will help with your grades and there is a term project at the end of the semester that isn't hard. Overall, I would just make sure you get all the points you can get and find ways to memorize the powerpoints.",1567
uler_neslihan,5,C,AREC326,"Class is very difficult (Especially if you are placed into it without taking calc 1 like me) but Prof Uler is extremely helpful ad understanding.  She is able to break down some complicated concepts and is really humorous.  Even though i bombed the course, I still learned some interesting economic concepts from her, and I would recommend anyone who has to take this class to take it with her.",1569
uler_neslihan,5,A+,AREC326,Really easy to follow and really easy to learn. This course requires students to know some basic math methods to solve problems. ,1569
uler_neslihan,5,A,AREC326,"She is a very respectful lecturer. The class is organized, and you can learn a lot from her class. And for Chinese students, this course is not difficult at all. So most of the people who got A or A+  are Chinese. And if you get 85+, you will get an A. So if you work hard, I think, at least, you can get a B+.",1569
kangas,5,A,BSCI373,"Favorite professor I've had in College. He really likes what he does. I learned a ton in this class. I only took the final, which did involve a lot of studying but it paid off. However, I would recommend taking the two optional mid-terms. It gives more cushion on your grade. ",1573
kangas,3,A,BSCI373,"Please do not take this course unless you really have to or you are interested in the material. I am a bio major (not interested in ecology) and this was a tough class for me. What you think this class will be about...is probably not what you think. It is not simply learning about the different species of the chesapeake/evolution/ecology. You should also be interested in environmental engineering and good at math calculations. You must be able to understand and produce what are known as energy circuit diagrams...I had no clue how to do this even after the course and kind of lucked out by memorizing every one he put in lecture...without really understanding how to produce one. It is not easy...but the differential equations that come along with them are not too bad to understand.

There are 3 possible grades in the class. 2 midterms and a final. You don't have to take either midterm...it's a little game he likes to play. The final you must take. If I were you, I'd take one of the midterms, whichever material you feel most comfortable with and the final. 

Tests: MC, T/F, reproducing graphs, calculations, matching. The matching is probably the worst part, because he allows for multiple answers. This is quite difficult when you have a list of 70 species and have to categorize them by various subjects...points are easily taken off if you do not know everything about each species. So basically his tests are not easy...but you can succeed if you study very hard!

I got an A in this class...but I'm probably one of not many who did. He doesn't curve this class...it doesn't matter how many As are in the distribution...there is no curve. So do well on all exams.

Hint: GO TO LECTURE. Record him and write down EVERYTHING he says. Lectures consist of all pictures, not much text...so if you miss lecture, it will be hard for you to understand the lectures. DO the homeworks. I repeat: GO TO LECTURE. He takes in consideration people who put a lot of effort and this may or may not help your grade as far as I know!",1573
kangas,5,,ENST373,"Really cool professor, his teaching style: only three grades, 2 optional midterm exams (you can show up take the test and decide if you want to turn it in or not) and one final exam.  The final was based largely on the first two tests.  The hardest part of the class is trying to figure out what he's going to test you on.",1573
leisnham,5,A,ENST436,"The professor is very nice and well-organized. The format of the class consists of daily powerpoint presentations on different environmental issues (ranging from climate change, to biodiversity) with occasional lectures by guest speakers. The class is very interactive, and the content is simple enough to be easily understood.

The exams are very straightforward, and are straight from lecture.  There are 3 group projects that are worth the bulk of the grade, and pop quizes throughout the semester. If you spend a little bit of time everyday reviewing the material, the class is a breeze. The group projects themselves were pretty enjoyable.",1574
apter,5,A+,ANSC453,"Amazing and easy to talk to! Caring, kind, interesting. Really engages with students. I've taken 3 of his classes and did well in all!",1576
apter,5,,ANSC227,"i really enjoyed this class even though it was asynchronous, highly recommend for a gen ed! i learned so much but at the same time it was manageable. Took it as asynchronous, so it would've been more fun with synchronous labs (making food..) The most tedious part was the multiple short JE responses (3 page papers throughout the course), but not bad. ",1576
ballenger,5,A,INAG110,Easy class. Good teacher. Fair grader,1580
ballenger,5,A,INAG110,"Great guy and professor. I felt like I learned a lot from his class, and he made the class engaging and interactive. He's a bit tougher grader than some other OC professors (a.k.a. you're going to have to work a bit for your grade) but the payoff is a great speech learning experience. Would def recommend his course",1580
ballenger,5,A,INAG110,Prof. Ballenger handled online classes and teaching very well. He is very approachable during and outside of class. The speeches make up the majority of the grade with a few participation assignments. He grades pretty fairly and gives constructive comments for improvement. This class is one of the few ones I enjoyed during Zoom University. ,1580
balcom,4,A,ANSC225,"Dr. Balcom is...interesting. She can seem really intimidating and condescending but when it comes down to it, she really cares about her students. She is really flexible in extending deadlines if you talk to her about it and you realize just how nice she is. She's very open to working on projects with you and talking you through the process. If you turn something in late or do really badly on an assignment she'll take off only a couple of points. This being said, she has to see that you're a hard worker and you're really trying. Not just trying to turn in everything late. You have to be sincere about needing an extension or wanting a good grade. She's one of the most understanding professors I've ever had. 
The only problem I have with her is I'm not really sure if I like how she lectures. It just seems condescending. I think that's just a personal opinion though. I'm sure other people are okay with it. ",1583
balcom,2,A,HONR218C,"This class was far more work than it ever should have been. With weekly (~3 page) reflections, graded in-class participation, regular reading assignments (consisting of dozens of pages of technical papers), two large essays (~10 pages each at 10 pt font, writing about Internet views on Harambe, believe it or not), a partner research-project / student-lecture, and a final group video project, this class consumed countless hours of my time. Despite all this, it still feels like I learned almost nothing from the class as a whole. Dr. Balcom is fairly nice, but the class itself was positively dreadful. Overall, I recommend looking for your general-education credits somewhere else, unless you are sincerely interested in the public perception of animals.",1583
balcom,5,A,ANSC101,"If you do the pre-class quizzes (which are not timed and open note), attend lectures, and participate in class you will at the very least get a B in this class. It isn't a difficult class. Reading can be heavy but refer to the units objectives, which she makes very clear, and use that as a guideline for writing your pre class notes. ",1583
balcom,4,A,ANSC101,"This class was the heaviest workload out of all my classes in the beginning. The due dates are what was the most annoying. She also seems to be a lot but once the middle/end of the semester comes around most of it all makes sense. She really cares about her students and wants to prepare us for our future (harder) classes. Be prepared to have to interpret science papers, infographics, and other note-taking assignments. This class is not an easy A but is definitely possible if you work for it. Now that I understand why she seems to want so much from us, I would take her again.",1583
rahaman,1,B,NFSC100,"One of the worst lecturers I've ever witnessed. He's probably a very smart dude, but terrible at giving a decent lecture. He was one of 4 lecturers for my class.",1584
micallef,1,A-,PLSC115,"Let me say this class is an easy A in terms of work. She grades super weirdly though so other people may disagree with me. This isn't a hard class at all, but everything that went on in this class was obnoxious to say the least. There is clearly no communication between her and the TA. The TA we had when I took the course was terrible, she wouldn't follow the professors instructions and graded as she pleased even though it wasn't fair. An example of this is she took a point off of a classmates discussion for being on her phone, she said this was the first day of class after weeks of asking her what date she was on her phone and if she made a note of it. (The discussion is a huge part of our grade and there are always people on their phones and laptops who she never deducted points from.) The assignment on the first day of class was to use your phone and to text in your answers of questions and they would appear on the screen. She wouldn't let students sign in to attendance being 2 minutes late to a lab that was a 15 min walk away from our normal classroom. She told us we needed to talk once a day during the semester then that changed to not being enough and we had to talk more than once and sending in articles to not? It was so confusing and obnoxious, especially if you have other demanding classes and work going on. The professor is extremely hard to get in touch with, takes weeks for her to email you back because she's always out of the country. When I emailed her about the TA she had absolutely no idea what was happening. In all honestly it's not a hard class at all, and the material is interesting, but this was honestly the worst class I have ever taken here at UMD and I can't say I recommend it at all. This class is a huge waste of time, but if you're looking for an easy A and don't mind dealing with all this non-sense maybe take this class.",1587
micallef,4,A,PLSC115,"The class was an easy A (if you study for the tests). Dr. Micallef was interesting to listen to online (I put the lectures at 1.25 speed or it would have been a bit slow to focus) and did a great job of explaining things. The tests were very difficult. Also, the group project was terrible (just because she did not provide lots of details on what she wanted and then graded it super strictly.)",1587
lansing,4,,,"Pros:
-Nice teacher
-Fair
-Helpful


Cons:
-The class is stupid. You can learn all the material she teaches on Wikipedia. I shouldn't have wasted money for this course but I needed an Advanced CORE class. ",1589
jaffee,3,A,AREC345,"I had him during his first year teaching at UMD. Professor Jaffe is a very nice person. He is genuinely engaged with the material and has first-hand experience from his work at the World Bank that he brings up and is really interesting. Sometimes his lectures will seem a little dry, but the content is really interesting. There was a lot of reading in the class and it was overwhelming, but he recognized that and plans to make changes for the curriculum. For his first time as a professor, I think he did a great job and you will learn a lot if you take his class. The essays he had us write were very cool and engaging I had a lot of fun with them.",1591
jaffee,2,C,AREC345,This class is very difficult for a gen-ed requirement. There is a lot of reading and requires you to analyze data that is probably unfamiliar with a lot of students. Professor Jaffee is not a terrible teacher but this class is going to be hard for anyone who has not studied economics before or is not aware of world economics. The exams are not terrible as they are just short answers and a couple essays. The three papers are very hard to conceptualize and the curve on them is minimal. I would advise taking another class if you are trying to get a distributive study course out of the way. ,1591
jaffee,2,,AREC345,"Overall the class wasn't too challenging in terms of the content and how the course is set up. Three papers, a midterm and a final. Overall not a very engaging professor for such a bland and boring subject, which made the class worse than it had to be. If you do the readings and attend lecture you should get no less than a B. Wouldnt recommend though for any gen ed requirement that this class fills out though",1591

Josh only cares about 360 degree and is not there of his students. He attempted to force one of his students to accept their first job after college in a rural, high- poverty US state. He also knows more about this business than what he is really letting on in both JOUR 361 and JOUR 368K. He is associated with a demo reel company, Reel Media Group and hurt one of his students resulted in their professional career being destroyed.",1605
vasudevan,5,A,JOUR200,"Professor V is definitely one of the best professors I've had. He explains everything and answers all questions to the best of his ability. Unlike most professors, he is genuinely interested in how his students are doing and makes sure every once in a while that his students are feeling good about everything that's going on. He is extremely helpful in terms of providing feedback on any assignment he gives and honestly wants to see his students succeed and improve. His exams are fairly doable and not at all confusing or challenging -- if you go over all his slides and pay attention in class, you will get through this class in a breeze. ",1608

yaros,1,B,JOUR289I,"This could have been a very interesting class. While Yaros does attempt to accommodate students, his lectures tend to be very biased when it pertains to his area of research (a very my-way-or-the-highway type). I agree with the person below, he sounds very condescending during class. His rubrics are often unclear and he is very nitpicky with grades, while offering very little feedback. I put in a good amount of effort, even visiting his office multiple times, but I'm walking away with a B. I wish they would offer this class with a different professor, it would be much more interesting and fun (what an I-series is meant to be).",1612
yaros,2,B,JOUR289I,"Pro: The class is well-structured with weekly, consistent assignments. Yaros is very understanding of student workloads and tries to work with them.
Con: Yaros is inconsistent with his grading criteria and is extremely picky about assignment submissions. When he shows examples of good journalism in class, the articles shown clearly contradict the principles he talks about earlier in the class. He's understanding of students but can come across as condescending at times when it comes to the course material. I expect most people to get a 'B' in this class.",1612
yaros,5,A-,JOUR150,"AWESOME CLASS. I know nothing about Journalism and am horrible with technology so it was a very challenging class in my opinion.

yaros,5,A-,JOUR150,"I loved class with Yaros, the whole class is general is very much based on technology so be prepared for that! I loved using twitter, blogspot, my phone and laptop specifically for the class. Final project seems like it will be a pain but he grades fairly as long as you do whatever it asks. He lets students borrow macbooks and itouchs to do assignments. Fun time!",1612
yaros,4,A,JOUR289I,"Yaros is a nice guy, and wants to see his students succeed.  Taking this class as a senior was enlightening; the freshmen and sophomores who did not take the class seriously set the bar for an ""A"" quite low.  I did the homework (and put in the effort) and paid attention during the class time.  He (pretty much) requires you to have your laptop in class to participate.  His assignments are quite fun; you blog and tweet things.  Interesting class, easy grading (if you actually care) and you get to use an iPad for half the semester.  Glad I took the class.",1612
yaros,4,A-,JOUR289I,"Professor Yaros is a great guy and knows how to keep class rolling.  He is into technology which is great because he uses twitter and blackboard IM very efficiently.

moeller_susan,4,A,JOUR175,"JOUR175 was fine, it was a lot of really petty assignments though. We had a weekly 300-500 word ""blog post"" due, which was basically summarizing a bunch of links that she gave us about media and big data and topics like that, and you also had to comment on others' ""blog posts"". No one ever finished the in-class assignments that we had, so our TA would always push back the due date. Lectures were horribly boring though, and barely had information pertaining to the midterm and final. The midterm and final were just a bunch of short answer questions based on vocabulary that we learned in class or from the discussions, but they're so easy to BS. 

Though this class required a fair amount of time, it was easy enough, and it covers a couple of geneds, but be prepared to do a lot of writing for it. ",1619
moeller_susan,3,A-,JOUR175,"This class is not too bad, but a decent amount of work week to week.
My TA graded way too harshly, and was not so good. The class only meets once a week in lecture and once in discussion, so that is nice.
Most of the assignments (blog posts excluded) are interesting. Lecture is pretty boring most of the time and it is impossible to take notes. On the other hand, the exams are a joke. 3/4 essays which are graded leniently.
Bottom line: Not a bad class to take, but hope to get a good TA.",1619
moeller_susan,3,,JOUR175,Pretty easy class because we don't actually do much. Lectures were super boring most of the time. Most lectures are her talking with loads of youtube videos that don't upload properly or pictures. Weekly news quiz in lecture and a blog post due every week based on what was covered in lecture. Mostly busy work but an easy A,1619
moeller_susan,2,A,JOUR175,"First of all, this is a fantastic class to take. It fulfills several Gen-Ed requirements, and is an easy A, with minimal work every week. If your TA is good like mine was, the discussion each week will be engaging and enjoyable. The exams were also quite simple, just 3 essays each.

That being said, the lecture is unbearably boring. I pay attention literally none of the time, and would not attend at all if it were not for the weekly news quizzes. The lectures are uninteresting, barely relate to what we do in discussion, and Moeller is usually a boring lecturer. 95% of the class just plays with their laptops and ignores her.",1619
moeller_susan,4,A,JOUR175,"Pretty easy class. Every week there was a blog post that only had to be about 300 words, and each week, there was a different topic covered. A few special projects were sprinkled in, but these were nothing more than field trips to the Holocaust museum or the Newseum or making a public service announcement.

Prof. Moeller's lectures were all very interesting. Every week she had a PowerPoint and would just talk, but they contained interesting videos from the Internet and I didn't take notes on a single lecture all year. Discussions were boring, but luckily, they're only once a week.

Both the final and midterm were in class: four possible prompts, of which you choose three and write. Both were out of 30 points, and I did not study for either one, and still wound up with A's. 

Overall, easy class. Got an A with minimal effort, and actually had fun with a few of the topics covered. I would definitely recommend. ",1619
moeller_susan,5,A,JOUR175,"I thought Professor Moeller was pretty awesome. A couple of posters mentioned that ""you either love or hate"" her, but I don't really agree with that at all. There is nothing about her personality that you could hate. Sometimes lecture can get a little boring, but she supplements them with really fun Youtube videos and interesting pictures. Plus, everyone has their laptop open during lecture (and she sometimes encourages this) so if it gets boring, you can have that.

There is a blog post due every week and a few other projects that involve a bit of work, but the world is not difficult, just tedious, if anything. This class was pretty fun overall and it was interesting learning about the effects of the media in terms of advertisement, portrayal of women and minorities, and global exposure. 

The class is structured with two classes a week, one 75 minute discussion and one 75 minute lecture. You can't really skip discussion because they take attendance and you will probably miss an in-class assignment. For lecture, there are news quizzes every week which affect your grade. There is an extra credit question on every news quiz, however, so you can afford to skip two or three pretty easily.

My favorite class about this BY FAR is the exams. There is a midterm and a final and you don't need to learn any terms for either of these. If you have been paying attention even a little bit to her lectures, throughout the semester, you don't need to spend any time studying at all. The midterm and final are comprised of essay questions that are very easy to answer/bull shit. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this class. While it's super easy to get a B in this class, some of the TAs make you work a little harder for an A, but to the best of my knowledge, not that hard.",1619
moeller_susan,4,B+,JOUR175,"This class was very easy. There is weekly readings and you have to blog about on a class website and random news quizes that are all very simple. There is a significant amount of reading for the blogs, but as long as you are not the first to post it is pretty easy to B.S. based upon others posts. Discussion in mandatory but you do simple group projects that are sometimes fun. The final exam took me about 20mins to finish and it was during regular lecture not on final exam day. I recommend this class highly for a solid B w/ little work and a definite A with normal effort in class. ",1619
moeller_susan,4,B,JOUR175,"As a previous poster mentioned, Moeller is the type that you will either love or hate. Personally, I loved her. She likes to keep things young and vibrant (even down to the way she dresses lol) so she shows a lot of Youtube videos and takes lots of class time up asking the class their opinions on current events. I honestly didn't learn anything in this course, but I did find her lectures to be very intriguing and I looked forward to the class.
I must admit, outside of lecture the assignments were highly annoying. Every week you have to write a 300 word blog post on some 10+ pg reading about nothing. You have to write papers after visiting the holocaust and newseum, several group projects, and there is a short news quiz in every lecture and discussion. None of it is hard, but the assignments never relate to anything (like I said, I didn't learn anything) so completing them always feels like a waste of time.
Everyone has said the most important thing is picking a good TA, but most of the time you won't know who to pick since they change often. To be safe I would say don't choose this as an easy A course, but if you want to balance out a difficult schedule with a good time, lazy elective, then this is right for you.",1619
moeller_susan,5,A,JOUR175,"Very fun and interesting class! Moeller is quite the character. You either love or hate her personality. She's very active in her field and a good lecturer. She fills lecture with intersting and often hilarious videos to keep things interesting. She's a big fan of YouTube. Discussion is fun too, that depends on your TA though. There is definitely some work involved - very heavy on homework, a couple projects, papers, exams. The assignments are time consuming but also unique and fun. (e.g. there's one where you write a paper about going 24 hours without any technology). I definitely recommend taking this class!",1619
moeller_susan,1,B,,"She is awful! First of all, we only met once a week, and she wasted our class time by asking us to go around the room and share random anecdotes that had nothing to do with research. Then, in the last 5 minutes of class, she would suddenly ask us to do a bunch of work, but wouldn't explain how to do it. No one had a clue what was going on. After giving little to no feedback all semester, she all of a sudden told us how much she hated our blog posts. I do not recommend this course.",1619
moeller_susan,4,B,JOUR175,"I took this class as an elective and it was one of the reasons I decided to change my major to journalism.  The class itself is very interesting. Lectures with Moeller are typically interesting, she shows a lot of YouTube videos/ads/photographs to analyze.  It's not about memorizing everything it's about learning general ideas (properties of propaganda) and applying them to everyday media.  As everyone else has said, your TA is the most important part.  I have Elia Powers and he's great and is a pretty easy grader.  He never gives C's (he told us this) and usually grades between high B's to low A's.  

Every week in lecture is a news quiz to basically take attendance (just Google questions). Every week in discussion is a 2 question quiz on basic concepts from class (like what artist did we watch a YouTube video of in class) to again get attendance.  Every week there is a blog post due on a certain topic where you have readings to look at and you must respond to them in 300 words, it's a lot to do it every week but not that hard.

There's also a few projects.  You have to go to the Holocaust Museum and write a 5 page paper.  You also have to visit the Newseum in D.C. (actually an awesome museum) and write a blog post on it as well as a question on the final being about it.  You also have to make a PSA, but it's not that hard.

There's a midterm and a final with 3 essays.  The midterm gave a picture and you had to analyze it, we watched 2 news clips covering the same event and had to cover that, and then write an essay on how social media plays a role in natural disasters.  It's pretty easy to BS cause it's a lot of opinion.

I know this is a lot but I like to find reviews that tell me what assignments there are and everything like that.  Overall, enjoyable class.",1619
moeller_susan,3,B+,,I really enjoyed the class but my TA refused to give anything above an 8 on the homeworks and nothing above a 90 on the midterm and final. I ended up with an 89 and he wouldn't bump it to an A. Make sure you get a cool TA if you take this class. ,1619
moeller_susan,1,B+,JOUR175,"I for one thought Professor Moeller's lectures were almost useless. The only new things I learned were the terms I had to memorize for the midterm and final, and I forgot them as soon as the tests were over. She's very unresponsive to students and does not do a good job weighting grades. For example, a five page paper for which I was required to visit the Holocaust Museum in DC was worth as much as finding a video on Youtube which talked about cell phone usage. She didn't offer a good excuse.

Like a previous poster said, what makes this an easy course depends largely on your TA. For the first half of the semester, my TA wasn't very specific about what he expected on the homework assignments. It reached a point where I pestered him for two weeks until he gave me an answer. Only then did I start breezing through the course, but by that point it was too late to raise my overall grade to an A. Bottom line: Make sure you know what your TA wants from you.",1619
moeller_susan,3,B,JOUR175,"I think that Prof. Moeller is great at lecture, there were some really interesting days, but pick your TA carefully! The grades vary between the TAs greatly - mine doesn't give out As at all - so if you're taking this as an ""easy A"" beware to pick a good TA! Overall not a class I would take again.",1619
moeller_susan,1,A,JOUR175,"I am not responding to Professor Moeller as a lecturer. She is actual quite interesting in lecture and uses lots of good videos as part of her slides.
However, the discussion aspect of the class is extremely confusing. It is impossible to figure out what you need to do for the assignments and there area a lot of group projects.
I would not recommend that you take this class at all (I signed up for OurUMD just to make this comment), but if for some reason you still want to, make sure you check out the COURSEEVAL link on Testudo... although the average GPA for the class is high, it actually varies significantly between TA's. So if you're taking this class as an ""easy A"" it will  most likely make your life easier to pick and choose what section you are in carefully.
Again, I'm really not trying to bash on Professor Moeller as a lecturer. She hasn't been very responsive to student concerns, but she doesn't really know what goes on in the discussions.",1619
moeller_susan,4,B,JOUR175,"She is a good teacher. Many videos are shown in class so its very rare that one gets bored. There are two tests and they are easy (basically argue your opinion very well and its at least a high B). The only catch is that there are about 12-13 pages during the semester, and they are moderate. The first few papers are graded very harshly but it eases out in the end",1619
moeller_susan,3,A,JOUR175,"Professor Moeller is very knowledgeable, she is just terrible at transmitting that knowledge to students. Lectures were sometimes interesting, but unnecessary to attend to achieve a high grade. There is a 2 page paper due every week, but they're a piece of cake. Final was a breeze. Get Jessica Roberts as your TA and the course is a cakewalk, she rocks.",1619
moeller_susan,5,A,JOUR175,"Professor Moeller's class was very easy.  Lectures were pretty much optional, although there was one day in discussion when they quizzed us to see if we were at the previous lecture.  There are weekly assignments that are short and easy.  There is no midterm and a final that from what I have heard is easy.  The class is very interesting and it does not take much effort or knowledge to get a good grade.",1619

moeller_susan,1,A,JOUR175,"Horrible teacher. Her assignments made no sense. On ELMS, she'll say one thing. Then, in class she'll describe the assignment a different way. Her TA's describe another way, and if you email Susan about the discrepancies, she tells you to drop the class. The entire class was just busy work and she refuses to negotiate on anything.",1619
jacobsen_timothy,5,A-,JOUR203,"if you're taking 203, TAKE JACOBSEN! really awesome guy who really wants to see his students do well. there are weekly assignments (like every 203 class) where you go out and collect photos/audio/video and then a final project that is a huge portion of your grade where you combine all 3 (or not, really up to you/your project). he gives you the final 3 or so weeks of class time to work on your final project, so you really should be able to finish before finals start. he's super helpful and understanding and overall just a really cool guy. ",1621
jacobsen_timothy,4,,JOUR370,Prof. Jacobsen is a hard grader. It seems like he expects us to know how to shoot photos perfectly before we enter the class and grades us based off it. His grading method is not very transparent but you do learn a lot through his comments on ELMS. He's a very nice guy but drones on and on in class about irrelevant things.,1621
bennett,3,A+,,He is a very nice guy. His class is hard to follow because guest lecturers come each week and have presentations. Make sure you ask him what is on the exam so you are clear. ,1623

hu_ming,5,A+,ARCH462,"This was, at least for me, the hardest architecture class I've taken so far, but it was also very interesting. The class was mainly asynchronous with one optional weekly check in. Professor Hu was very accommodating and took the time to check in with, listen to and help students. The information presented in the class is definitely very helpful and applicable to the real industry. The tests weren't too bad and the assignments were ok as well- if you study and take good notes, you will do well. Professor Hu does a good job of explaining generally complicated things in a context that students can understand. Would recommend!",1637
eisenbach,3,B+,ARCH170,"Eisenbach is an average professor. ARCH170 is an average class. You have 5 major projects, but you have to submit drafts, etc. You basically have something due every week. Discussion is mandatory. There are useless readings and online quizzes to ensure you read them. As I mentioned earlier, this is an average class. If you put in average work, you will get an average grade. I got a B because my TA had some sort of Vendetta against me. 

Bottom Line: Only take this class if you don't mind learning about nonsensical architectural principles, and doing a bit of analyzing.",1674
eisenbach,4,B,ARCH170,"I really liked Eisenbach, she was tough, but good. She was easy to contact and she kept the class interesting. She gave a few quizzes throughout the semester, but they were really only for attendance and counted as extra credit. There were four big projects throughout the semester, but she gave plenty of time to do them. Her exams were fair; if you study you'll do well, if you don't study you will not. I only ended up with a B because I didn't study enough for the final exam and did poorly on it. It is a fun class and I highly recommend it.",1674
eisenbach,3,B,ARCH170,"Class was alright, thought it would be okay to take her for an easy A for a CORE (didn't think it would be that bad). I could have sworn I would have had it too but he projects were sometimes annoying. It can be interesting at times though and I do remember a lot of the stuff, but if you just need an easy CORE class, look elsewhere at THET110 or something - ARCH seemed needlessly complicated for this kinda stuff.",1674
eisenbach,4,A-,ARCH170,"The course was overall pretty easy, but very time-consuming. Only take it if you have an interest in architecture or drawing. Otherwise, the projects can be painful. The easy exams and extra credit points make up for it though. Relatively all course notes were online. I only studied those notes and aced the exams. Class was only necessary for the random extra credit opportunities. Getting an A is very manageable with adequate time and some patience. ",1674
eisenbach,3,B+,ARCH170,The class is pointless and the assignments really have nothing to do with the class. A lot of time goes into the assignments and should be worth more points. The tests are basically just trivia.,1674
eisenbach,3,A,ARCH170,"Projects are 50% of the grade, but they take way longer than you think. The 4th which is the final project, took me 30+ hours to complete.  
I found the notes she posted online extremely helpful when study for exams, although they are essentially the same stuff she has gone over in class, it is hard to stay awake through her lectures, so it is wise to read over the online notes to refresh memories.
There are extra credit opportunities given in the beginning of randomly selected lectures, so it would be your loss if it's given the day you skipped lecture or were late to class. ",1674
eisenbach,4,A-,ARCH170,"Eisenbach is what I call a spoon-feeding professor, as she spoon-feeds you information piece by piece and likes to linger on easy concepts. So this is good news for many.

Skipping one class isn't the end of the world since she has a class website that has all the information on it. But she does give out extra credits, each worth 5pts, so I do suggest going to class. You want to earn all the extra credit you can because you WILL lose points for the exams!

The exams are graded harshly. You have to KNOW exactly what you're talking about! Studying the exact wording off of her website helps.

There are four assignment, besides the first one being an essay, the other three are all drawing related. Be ready to spend a significant amount of time on those since no ruler's allowed. The process also includes visiting and analyzing the sites..etc. On the last project, I spent nearly 20hrs. But the work did pay off.

Bottom line: Good professor. Be ready to be spoon-fed the material. Easy material, but it's about implementing the concepts in your projects. Recommended for those who have taken drawing classes and with some degree of creativity. ",1674
eisenbach,4,A,ARCH170,"While the projects take a lot of time, the exams are easy. Make sure you go to class for the first 2/3 of the semester because she gives out extra credit in class and it adds up to 5 points on your exam grade (which is out of 100) which is really nice. Find someone in your discussion that you can go to the sites with for the projects and take advantage of T.A. office hours because those also really help. I recommend this class if you are looking for an easy A and/or an HA requirement. Also don't buy the two books for this class they are a waste of money and you don't need them. Just use the notes online to study for the exam.",1674
eisenbach,3,B,ARCH170,The lectures are very boring.. she dims the light so half the class is asleep. projects are very time consuming. I got an  a high A on all the projects and I averaged B's on the exam and I got a B+. Projects were way more time consuming and should have counted for more. This class is a waste of time if you want an Easy A for HA core. I recommend taking something easier.,1674
eisenbach,4,A-,ARCH170,"This review is coming from an ARCH major, so the opinion may vary....

I found this class, and the teacher, to be very nice. The lectures can be a bit boring, and she does post the notes online, so students are tempted to skip. But in all honesty, the lectures are great for clarifying subjects (Especially near the beginning with the topics on Theories) and you can only partake in the extra credit options if you're on the specific day for lecture. 

The majority of your grade, however, is dependent upon the TAs. I find that they tend to be a little leniant on grading, probably because this is a CORE class as well as an ARCH requirement. Also, be very careful with time management! The assignments can take longer than they first appear, and I (personally) had my discussion on fridays so I found that most of my ""late-niters"" occured on Thursday nights. 

The tests aren't so bad if you study and attend lecture. The extra credits are FIVE points on a test, which always means the difference between a B+ and an A-. ",1674
eisenbach,4,A-,ARCH170,"THIS REVIEW IS COMING FROM AN ARCHITECTURE MAJOR, MINORING IN HISTORY SO OPINION MAY DIFFER FROM OTHERS. 

I found the class very interesting. The material is a cross between architectural basics and history. Material is straight forward, presented clearly, and posted online.  The tests are not difficult however I do recommend studying. Assignments are not too difficult but the time commitment may catch up with you. 

Eisenbach seems to really enjoy the material and that appears through her teaching. She also seems to care about the students and trys to involve them in the lecture. 

Most students who complain about the class are non architecture majors taking it for an easy HA (which is true on a case to case basis). 

Complaints by others say the professor is boring presenting dry lectures. ",1674
eisenbach,2,,ARCH170,"She is a very boring teacher.  Lectures are very dry and are typically unhelpful.  The online notes are much more helpful than lecture.  Tests are very easy despite not listening at all during lecture.  Projects are time consuming, but pretty fun.  TAs are in general good",1674
eisenbach,2,A,ARCH170,"The material is simple. It is easy to get good tests grades without putting much effort into reading the online notes or learning from the lectures. 

Though, the assignments are time consuming ""busy-work"" tasks. Much of the work involves freehand sketching to scale and teaches you nothing. 
If you do not like drawing, this class will piss you off. Take musc205 for HA instead.",1674
eisenbach,4,,ARCH170,"  ARCH 170 was a very interesting, but different class! I took it mainly for the purpose of getting my HA out of the way, and I felt like I made the right choice in that regard.  Although I never had taken an architecture class before, and although I'm not really that artistic or too creative/design oriented, I got quite a bit out of the class, and I didn't feel like I was at a disadvantage by not having any background experience-the TAs were really cool about it, and the projects didn't require perfection, just effort and following directions.
  Speaking of projects, they are probably the biggest part of the class! There are four of them, worth a total of 50% of your grade-two midterms and a final are worth the other 50% (each exam=10%, final=30%).  The thing about the projects though is that each one is worth progressively more percentage, so you need to make sure you don't slack off as the semester goes on!  In general, the projects are pretty neat! Just be careful though, because they take more time than they originally might seem to require-so don't procrastinate!  And don't be hesitant about talking to your TA, because they can be very helpful!
 Attending discussion and coming prepared is a must! If you don't attend, your grade will suffer!  Most of the discussions revolve around the projects, except for the week before exams where we do reviews.  Make sure you come prepared to discussion though, because often times there are intermediate steps to the projects and you will lose points if you don't come to discussion prepared!
 The lectures are not the most exciting and sometimes Professor Eisenbach can seem to talk about unnecessary information.  However, even though most of the notes are available online, make sure you go to lecture as often as you can-there will occasionally be extra credit tasks, so you don't want to miss them.
 Besides the projects, the homework was just reading from the textbooks.  Although it wasn't ""checked"" in any sense, I recommend you do read because it can be beneficial-and make sure you thoroughly check out the Supplemental Reading booklet because it will probably be used on your exam in some sense.
 The exams are a combination of multiple choice, short answers and a essay.  The nice part is that she  gives out the 3 possible essays ahead of time and only puts 1 on the exam.  Therefore, if you prepare well, you should be able to get full credit for that part of the exam!  The multiple choice aren't too bad, just make sure to read the question carefully! The short answer is where I lost the most points, because the questions can be tricky and you often have to need to have really paid close attention to details to get full credit!
 All in all though, I got a lot out of this class, and it gave me some new experiences that you don't have in other classes.  Be aware, it can be a bit time consuming (you'll need to make a trip into DC!), but otherwise, you shouldn't have any problems if you do everything you are supposed to do, and if you take initiative on your assignments and plan ahead to make sure everything is done well!
 Good luck, and enjoy the class!",1674

Though we disagreed with pretty much everything, she respects you  if you bring intelligent points up and that goes a long way in determining how you do in the course. 

The subject matter is really mundane. I walked out of the course still wondering what I really learned and gained other than an easy A. 

She's really nice though and is always enthusiastic about the class each day and does say some thought provoking things. 2 5-7 page papers, and a 12-15 page final paper. Some quizzes scattered throughout on the readings, but I feel like they weren't even worth much of the grade.",1688

grant-wisdom,5,A,HONR269E,"Grant-Wisdom is such a good professor. If you're in the class for just the grade, don't take her class, you won't learn anything. Her teaching style is different from your average professor at the University of Maryland. She tries to engage you to think beyond what's given to you or implied. She tries to open your eyes to subjects that we are generally unaware of. She tries to give you an education that is beyond memorizing terms and taking exams. She truly wants people to learn. Her papers are about 5-7 pages and there are pop quizzes (30% of the grade) and a debate as well as a 10-12 page paper at the end. If you actually try and DO THE READINGS, you will get a good grade. She has a tendency to not believe students when they say they have read. However, if you show her that you have by participating and even bringing in your own experiences and thinking on a ""different level,"" she will enjoy your company and this helps with grading. The paper topics are usually very general but she provides a series of questions that can guide you through writing them. If you answer all the questions and REFER TO THE IN CLASS READINGS, you should do very well. Reading is very important for her, so definitely do it. Also, there are in-class presentations that the students do every class period. If you take this class, don't make it boring for your classmates. Include questions, images and video. Bring in your own stuff. She is very intelligent with a liberal perspective and she loves to rack people's brains with difficult questions. She doesn't answer them for you which is why some may think she doesn't understand questions, but she wants you to think, not to rely on her for your education. Don't be mad at her for making you think. 

Lastly, keep up with the news and current events. It helps you as a person understand the world better and also helps you understand the concepts. ",1688
grant-wisdom,5,A-,HONR268L,"She is an excellent professor, who spurs a lot of discussion in my Honors Seminar on US Immigration.  We do disagree on political ideaology, I'm a staunch conservative, and she's a liberal, but when you express all of your views constructively, I don't see much of an issue.  I am very passionate on such topics, and a plus for taking this class is that you naturally know a lot about current events, and that you keep up with international news.  This class surprised me in terms of how many factors affect US Immigration.",1688
grant-wisdom,1,B+,HONR269E,"Piss-poor professor. She's angry, unintelligent and uninspired. Her lectures are mind-numbingly dull and her interaction with the class in mandatory (and wholly unfruitful) discussion periods are just as bad. She often fails to understand questions and comments and regularly responds (and often interrupts) with emphatic non-sequiturs. Lectures vacillate between student presentations (boring), her own crude powerpoint-driven lectures (yawn) and lengthy discussion that she expects to shake us from our collective dogmatic slumber (which might actually work if we didn't have the natural curiosity of students with more intelligence than a sack of bricks).

The class requires two 5-7 page papers, a 10-12 page final paper, a presentation of one of the readings and an in-class debate. In short, it's a lot of grunt work for a class from which you aren't going to learn much anyway. The readings (and there are many!) are rather dry, but you'd better read them well them because she enjoys giving pop quizzes.

Grading is based on how much she thinks you care. If it's obvious you don't pay attention in class (she watches like a hawk) then your paper grades will suffer. If you decide to shape up and somehow get her to notice, you can crap on a stick and she'll give you a decent grade.

Don't take this class, and don't take her.",1688
grant-wisdom,2,A,HONR269E,Teaches as if you know both philosophy and all fundamentals of all governments around the world. The readings are long and tedious but you really don't have to do them if you know the subject well enough to discuss it in class. Really easy grader and you basically are guaranteed an A if you talk in class and put effort into the essays and presentations. No exams. Basically the class is easy to get an A in but you will feel like you really have accomplished nothing in the class because every class you just talk in circles. ,1688

Thank god she is a liberal like me! She's one of the view professors who let's her political ideology really color her lectures. Being professional is over-rated.

I also loved her because unlike some professors that try to get to know their students, she really leaves that to the TAs. I find it refreshing. I would rather get to know someone my own age anyway. ",1688
grant-wisdom,1,A,GVPT100,Outstanding speaker! Truly talented. Never before have I had a professor with such an extraordinary ability to put me to sleep. Her uncanny skill at dodging questions is astounding!and the novel-worths of notes that she rambles about in class are such profound nonsense that she's managed to used to same lectures for the past thirty years because no one can understand them.  Brilliant! I never thought I'd meet a professor capable of such monotonous drivel that prompts students to audibly groan with delight (or is it pain?) every time she pulls another page of non-information from out her ass.,1688

Her tests are very straightfoward and if you apply yourself and have the slightest aptitude for writing, you should have no problem earning an A (the TAs tend to grade pretty easily). Bring a lap top to this class! One 10-page paper, 2 exams, and a final. Discussion is mandatory and counts toward your participation grade (20%). There are also a few assignments where we need to write a 2-page (double spaced) summary/review of a movie which we watch in or out of class (about 4 of these assignments throughout the semester).",1688

First half of the semester is easy enough to skate by if you do the readings, as nothing is actually due - however, second half of the semester consists of three papers, two projects, and three pop quizzes. Much of the class is not really anything of substance and I was pretty bored (turned out to be much closer to resembling an economics class than one about sustainability), and she claims to not take sides but ""provokes"" people by playing devil's advocate. She blew up at our class over a misunderstanding about the definition of a word and its connotations about her material. That being said, she is a very nice lady outside of class and genuinely wants to push people into becoming better students. However, she did not post ANY of our few grades on Testudo over the entire semester, and it wasn't until the final grade was posted that I had an inkling of how well I did. ",1688

satelmajer,5,A,HONR239B,"I loved this class. As other have mentioned, it is not an easy A, but it is not extremely difficult either, if you find the subject interesting. We do read a lot, but it is a lot of novels spread across many days as well as short stores and poems. The class is very discussion based, which I found great especially for the more challenging and confusing texts. In addition to that, we had 3 papers, one of which is the final, and a journal. The key to the journal is to do more than what is expecting in order to get a good grade. The papers weren't too bad and she gives you good feedback and returns them in a timely manner. She is a very liberal teacher so I think your growth also contributes to your final grade. I definitely thought I would get a B+, and was surprised with an A. 

Overall, I love the books we read and I loved the class. It exposed to a lot of new ideas and knowledge. It was my favorite class this semester especially being a STEM major and getting away from that.",1692
satelmajer,5,A,,"This class was great!  It's about contemporary art and ideas (modern art) with a focus on the arts in DC.

Professor Satelmajer is a great teacher, and she breaks down the class into well organized and manageable sections.  This makes the material easy to learn and retain.  She is very good at communicating and is understanding to student concerns.

There are homework readings and maybe a video or two to watch each week, but the workload is not bad at all.  A lot of it is actually very interesting.  Most of the readings are pre-assembled in a course packet that you buy at the beginning of the year, and I found it very convenient  to annotate along in the packet as I read.

This class requires you to go to 5 or more arts events of your choosing and to write brief critical responses on them relating to the course/packet material.  I found the events to be awesome because they enlightened me to an art world that I didn't know about beforehand.  There are class field trips that can count towards your events.  The responses aren't long (~ 2 pages), but you have to write them well and relate directly to course concepts.  At the end of the year, your final report must be ~ 4-10 pages instead of the usual ~ 2.

I highly recommend this class and teacher.  I had a great experience and am surprised by how much I retained about DC/contemporary art.",1692

She does have random reading quizzes a lot though so make sure you're on top of the reading she does assign. She's also a pretty strict in grading papers- a lot of the class complained about it. She puts a great emphasis on detail from the reading and on originality of the argument. 

Her exams straightforward if you pay attention to what she emphasizes in class so make sure you take notes during her class. She also has some optional assignments that help at the end. She's really big on participation too and it really helps your grade! She's really passionate and always around to give help",1692

Lets you redo one of them though. The workload is doable but noticeable.

Every week you are required to read exhaustingly long and difficult to understand articles and answer questions about them. Then, you discuss the articles during class. There is one group presentation and a final paper. These are graded extremely subjectively and openly criticized during class.

Although Dr.Kruglanski is very smart, he is also demeaning, arrogant, and dismissive of any concerns.

The exams are a bit tricky, as they're a random mash up of his lectures and stuff in the book. If you go to class and take notes on your laptop and then skim the chapters though before the exam you'll be fine.

The material is easy and he is a pretty cool professor. Lectures arent boring, and the homework (worth 25% of final grade) is super EASY. You could literally do it an hour before class.

Would def recommend him if you want to get a good grade without trying too hard ;-)",1739
lehman,3,A,CCJS300,Okay professor. The 100 question quizzes were a bit much. He always told us about stuff like a day before it was due which was annoying but I did take this online bc COVID. He’s not terrible but I probably wouldn’t take again. ,1739
neustadtl,4,B+,SOCY201,"Like previously mentioned, easiest statistics class on campus. Open note, book, slides, previous exams/quizzes, homework, whatever, as long as you don't talk to the person sitting next to you. There is a long lab but it would behoove you to go since the TA's help A LOT with the homework questions. Not a painful class although I didn't understand all of the underlying principles of the meanings of the stats I'm still walking away with a good grade. ",1740
neustadtl,4,A,SOCY201,"This is probably the easiest statistics course you will find in CP. All the tests and quizzes are open note and open book, and he posts his lecture notes online. His lectures are pretty boring - by the second half of the semester i stopped going. I actually started doing better in the class by just attending the labs and teaching the rest to myself. The homeworks are really helpful come quiz/test time - the problems are very similar to the ones on the exams.",1740
glass,5,A,,"I've taken two classes with Professor Glass and couldn't have enjoyed them more. Each was a film class (one on terror and one on the Holocaust) and was really as involved as you wanted to make it. 
I found that actually doing the readings was helpful to my participation and understanding in the class. But really they were basically optional. 
His standards aren't high enough as far as participation and reading but he really knows his subject. He's just a really cool and interesting older dude and worth taking a class with.",1742
glass,4,A-,,"Professor Glass is like a nice, old, hippie grandfather (he sometimes will wear sunglasses due to some health condition, but it's a nice touch). I will admit I fell asleep in his lectures and didn't come to alot of the classes in the first couple weeks, but once you hear Professor Glass out, he and his muses are quite enjoyable to listen to. In the end, I found myself  reading the books, and going to all his lectures. It makes me a little sad that the class is done now.

The down sides to this class though is the grading method and exam style. There are only 3 exams + final. All of them are in-class essays. I suck at timed writing so it was difficult for me to whip a good paper in 50 mins. Also importantly, the TA grades them, not Professor Glass. 

Overall, if you like to think and write well under time constraint, you should be fine. If you don't, you may need to try harder to get an A. ",1742
glass,4,A,,"This course is easy if you read the books (or sparknote them, or skim). You must always attend discussion though. It's really helpful.

Lectures were often tangents that seemed unrelated to the books. That being said, professor Glass is extremely insightful and intelligent! He seems to be an endless pit of knowledge and facts. His lectures are always relatable and interesting. 

His voice is a bit monotone, though. Try to take a quick nap before classes; it will keep you from falling asleep. Lectures are unnecessary to attend, but I ALWAYS did just because I really enjoyed them. 

Can't wait to take more classes with Professor Glass!",1742

glass,5,B,GVPT241,"Truly brilliant. He kind of reminds me of a real-life Dumbledore. His lectures weren't incredibly easy to follow because he tended to go off on tangents, but I really enjoyed just going to class and listening to him. I did none of the readings and managed an A-, but I am also incredibly gifted in the art of BS. If you go to lecture and do the readings, an A is expected, if you don't do the readings a high B or low A are possible.",1742
glass,5,A,GVPT241,"Professor Glass is a trip. He is a very liberal guy who went to Berkeley in the 1960s and sometimes offers up funny little anecdotes about his time there. His lectures can sometimes be hard to follow but this could be due to many factors. 1)He is prone to going off topic and rambling. Even though he tangents are sometimes funny/insightful they are often random. So watch out for that. 2)Even though I am a government major, philosophy is not my forte so I often found the reading boring. But really I don't blame Glass for that. It's a requirement to learn about the past so we can study the future. And Glass tries his best to make it interesting.

More than anything, this class was entertaining. I learned a lot and even though some people think he is a crazy old coot, you have to appreciate him for who he is: a brilliant (if kooky) man who knows a lot about government, history, and philosophy.

Grades consisted of three written exams (two midterms and a final). Even if you don't read, attending lectures and discussions should get you at least a B. Make sure you attend discussion (TAs are extremely helpful at clarifying confusing topics) and you will do well.",1742
glass,2,A-,GVPT241,"Professor Glass will take you on a journey with his lectures and please be assured that you will probably get lost somewhere in the midst of it all. Hopefully your TA will be good so be sure to attend ALL discussion sections so they cn explain things to you better and tell you what to include in your exams. The exams are 2 in-class timed essays. They are a bit stressful to write in only 50 minutes but do your best. Be sure that you know each philosophers' personal views, experiences, and theories so that you can support things you say and compare their views. Your TA grades your exams so try to understand their style and want they look for in a good response. Know your stuff!",1742

glass,5,A,,"I loved this class, the lectures were always interesting and he manages to connect the texts together very meaningfully. If you are looking for a professor to summarize your assigned readings in lecture, you will not like Glass's teaching style. But if you are looking for a professor that treats you like an adult who can get the literal meaning of the text from reading the book, you will appreciate the anecdotes and background that Glass gives you during lecture. The honors section is a bonus because Glass leads the discussion section himself, which is great when you need to clarify points about the readings for the essays.",1742

glass,3,A-,GVPT105S,"Professor Glass - as a PERSON - is great. He's very kind, intelligent, thoughtful, and passionate. But his classes are extremely boring, and he relies almost completely on his TAs, who never seem to know what's going on. I would not recommend being in International Studies for College Park Scholars. Luckily I had a really cool TA so it wasn't as stressful, but we had five grades for the entire semester, 3 of which were long 5-7/6-8 papers based entirely on really dry readings. Lecture wasn't mandatory but he gave ""pop"" quizzes, but after half the class missed the first pop quiz they warned us beforehand about quizzes. He's a nice guy and you can probably get away without doing the readings and the TA's were easy graders, so an A can be expected (if you don't miss a quiz and submit every paper). But be prepared to be bored out of your mind, as every class he sits and talks for 50 minutes straight and never gives presentations - he doesn't do anything other than ramble. Be prepared to have convoluted and unclear topics for papers with TA's who won't be much help.",1742
glass,5,,GVPT241,"Dr. Glass has so much life experience and knowledge, and it’s so visible through his lectures. I was always fascinated by his ability to talk extemporaneously about dense political theory. He made great connections between older texts and their modern applications. I know that some people don’t like his rambling or slightly slower speech, but he is definitely someone you can learn a lot from. He always challenged my thoughts about the books that we read, and gave me a new perspective. I admired this professor and I hope to take him again in the future! As far as terms of grading goes, the TAs grade the 3 papers. Your experience can be varied depending on the strictness and expectations of the TA. Grades aside, I enjoyed Dr. Glass’ lectures very much. ",1742
glass,3,A,GVPT241,"This was probably my largest lecture, and I guess, as a result, there was a lot of “disconnect” between Glass and students. I know that there are a lot of large lecture classes in uni, but perhaps it was his style of lecturing that made it feel impersonal, and at times, really boring. Occasionally he’d digress into a side topic, but catch himself. But his style of lecturing is sometimes scattered to the point where you’re mentally thinking “????” while you’re writing notes. But he knew what he was talking about, which is why I gave him 3 stars.
His essay prompts were okay—sometimes they were so ambiguous or long that I’d have to talk to my TA about what he wanted. 
Granted, this class isn’t for everyone. If you’re not required to take it, don’t (unless you find political philosophy interesting)—I’m a gov’t major, so it’s required for me.",1742
glass,3,A,GVPT105S,"Dr. Glass is a cool guy who has both eloquence and intelligence. At first, lectures were concise, helpful, and analysing the assigned readings (Plato, Machiavelli, etc.). However, mid-way he began to go off-topic and talk about US politics and Trump for 50 minutes straight. 
3 papers and 3 pop quizzes (lowest quiz grade dropped) make your grade.",1742
glass,4,,GVPT241,"This is my second class with him and he has a theme, no tests or exams but he will issue 3 essays throughout the course with vague prompts.  Outside of that there have ben no assignments.  He's chill, but TA's run the show. ",1742

drazen,2,B+,ECON325,"I had him this past semester. I can honestly tell you I did not learn a single thing in this class. My final grade was a 55%, which was curved at least 32% to a B+. The TA's are not really helpful, and the models used are completely different from anything an economics student would have seen before this class. ECON201 really does not help with this class at all either.",1747
drazen,1,C-,ECON325,"This guy. I dont even have words for how bad he really is. Reads right off of the slides in a dry monotone voice. you can tell he just really doesnt care for macroeconomics very much which makes it harder on his students to grasp concepts when he doesnt present them with any energetic or constructive explanations or feedback. 
tests are extremely difficult with averages being around 50% sometimes lower. Just ridiculous im paying for this guy to speak the book information to me.  ",1747
drazen,1,,ECON325,"i would give him zero stars if i could. he reads right off the powerpoints and doesnt teach you anything else. if you have trouble sleeping take his course. 
professor chugh is a 100 times better professor. he explains the information better and is available to you. drazen will brush you off to his TA's. 
every other economoics course i took the professor explained the information well.
you are stuck taking him since he is the only one teaching it. if you can wait take it in the summer or if you know the material well take it in the winter.
he is being paid just to read the powerpoints verbatim. any questions you ask him will get an obvious NO or I dont know. ",1747
drazen,1,A,,"Although he seems to understand economics very well, and he is a nice person in general, Professor Drazen clearly has better things to do than teach his students.

He was consistantly late and when he wasn't late the lecture would start late because he can figure out his computer. He would then read off the slides word for word and vanish.

He seemed unconcerned when the midterm average was less than 30%. He brushed me off when I approached him for help, and passed me off to the TAs, which were even less helpfull.

In the end I learned very little and came away more confused than anything. The other professor teaching econ 325 wrote the book on this class (literally) I would take him if I had to do it again.",1747
drazen,1,C,ECON325,"I had Professor Drazen for ECON325 this semester, but the funny this was, he did not teach my class. All of his material were pulled directly from those of Professor Sanjay Chugh. In lecture, Professor Drazen was Professor Chugh's mouthpiece - he literally read off Professor Chugh's slides and did little in gauging whether his students understood the material.

There were only four grades in my class: two problem sets, one midterm and one final. This is absolutely absurd because by having so little grades, tremendous pressure is placed on each assignment and there is little to no chance of redeeming your grade if you do poorly on one assignment. Quite predictably, the problem sets were pulled from those of Professor Chugh. The problems were long and tough, so students resorted to consulting Professor Chugh's website for help. 

While I'm sure Professor Drazen is a very smart man and he understands Economics well, he is not fit to teach. It blows my mind that the university pays him $200,000 a year to read his colleague's slides. If this is how the professional world works, then shame on anyone who allows this. Never have I ever had a professor that cared so little about his students. Perhaps this was the reason why no one showed up to class.",1747
drazen,2,B,ECON325,"    Professor Drazen is the most boring teacher I have had at UMD.  If you are having trouble sleeping, I recommend attending his lectures.  By reading off powerpoint slides which he posted online, students had no reason to listen to him while in lecture or attend lecture at all for that matter.  The entire course consisted of 4 grades, with 40% based on the final exam which seems unfair.  Being an ECON major, I am extremely dissapointed at how little Professor Drazen seemed to care about his students",1747
drazen,5,B,ECON325,"Great Professor. Very easy to understand and follow his logic. You have to go to class though unless you really like cramming for exams from the book because he writes all of his notes on the chalkboard. 2 Midterms, 5 Problem Sets, 1 Cumulative  Final Exam.",1747
drazen,5,A,HONR259G,"Professor Drazen was great this semester.  He is an older guy who said he has listened to feedback about his lectures, and thus decided to have discussions led by students instead (Obviously guided by him as well with important points and readings beforehand).  
His class was very simple, had minimal work, and had fantastic discussion even for an Honors Seminar.  For someone who is not particularly technologically skilled, his adjustment to the virtual format was great.",1747
drazen,2,A,HONR259G,"Boring class and boring professor. Worse part was the course didn't have a final (according to the syllabus). A week before the course ends, prof. starts talking about a potential 1-2 page assignment. And then, at the very start of finals, he assigns a 5-6 page assignment. 

Unfortunate.",1747
chicoli,5,A,NEUR305,"Dr. Chicoli is not like any other professor at UMD. She was constantly making sure that we were doing okay when crazy things were happening over the semester in the outside world. She was extremely understanding and caring and flexible when it came to our circumstances and even those that were not in our control. She also disseminated information that was relevant to psych/neuro that we may be interested in. She was also really organized with all of the material when teaching an online class. The way the course topics were broken up into (memory, emotion, motor, etc) also followed the order of the chapters in the book. Also, many of the graphics and information that were presented in the lecture were also taken straight from the book. For these reasons, I would recommend using the book as a supplemental resource to look at things that you did not understand from the lecture. We had three exams that were pretty easy and were not a big chunk of your grade. We had about four reflection assignments in which we had to either watch or read about something and write a short (about a page) answering some questions on the rubric that was mainly opinion based. I really enjoyed these because the topics were on things like ethics and racial issues in the field of neuroscience. Every Friday we had synchronous classes in which we usually spent the time going over a research article either in groups or as a whole class. There were low-stake assignments accompanied by these that we completed during the class. The most important thing to take note of is the semester project. There is no final exam in the class it is just your final project. This can definitely take a big punch to your grade as it did mine. Make sure to put effort into it early on in the semester so that when it comes time to your final, it will be one less thing to worry about. Dr. Chicoli has set it up in a great way in which she breaks down the project into different parts that have different deadlines. This way, you are working on it slowly throughout the semester and when it comes down to the final you don't have to stress. I had an A+ the entire semester but was so crammed during finals week that when I was working on the final project during the allotted two-hour window, I did not finish one part of the project in time. I scored a 100% on every other part of the project but because that one part was worth a good amount of points, it bumped my final grade down from an A+ to an A. So I would definitely recommend not taking three finals back to back in one day and manage your time. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this class with Dr.Chicoli no matter the circumstance. The class may sound intimidating but the way that she has structured it and the way she is as a person is definitely catered towards student success. ",1749

As a professor, Kleykamp is awesome! She doesn't give boring lectures and makes the material relatable and easy to understand. The first 2-3 weeks of class were a bit intimidating, but once you get past that part, it is a great class. 

There are readings for every class, and sometimes it is a lot of reading but mostly interesting. There are also 2 short papers (4 pages) and 2 exams (non-cumulative final). There is also a graded journal entry every week, but it is just a 1 page reflection on the material for that week and it is graded on completion. As long as you put in the effort, it is an easy A. 

My only complaint is that it takes her FOREVER to grade papers!",1756
kumar_sujith,1,B-,GVPT241,"Worst prof ever. Gives out a plethora of reading quizzes, comprised of five poorly written questions, that are worth more than exam grades, percentage-wise. Every Monday and Wednesday. This class made me do the most for a 200-level class. ",1757

kumar_sujith,3,A,GVPT241,"I actually really liked this course. Kumar's lectures were kind of strange but still made sense.

zhou_naijun,5,A,GEOG373,"Professor Zhou is a great professor! He is very difficult to understand at times but all his lectures are posted online so even if you don't understand him in speaking you can still follow along on the slides. 

His labs are really straight forward with easy to follow step by step directions, If you actually show up and try for the labs you're gonna end up doing pretty good on them.

His exams are worth only 10 points each, they barely effect the overall grade but are still very important to do good on. He gives awesome study guides that make studying super easy. 

Oh did I mention that for his GIS technical classes an 85+ is an A? FYI, I'm a GIS major so I may find this easier then someone who has never been introduced to the topic. ",1764
zhou_naijun,5,A,GEOG373,I think professor Zhou is very good and helpful professor. You can tell he actually wants you to understand the subject. Although he does have an accent he really isn't that hard to understand. He explains things well and is good overall,1764
zhou_naijun,3,A,GEOG373,"This course is pretty simple. Dr. Zhou is a little hard to understand because of his accent, but he is a very nice professor. Lecture can drag on and at times be very boring, but it is important to attend. Dr. Zhou sometimes does calculations on the board that he does not include in his PowerPoints, and these calculations are usually on the exams. There are two midterms and a final, plus lab assignments. Lab is held every other week, so you have plenty of time to work on the assignments. There is a take home lab practical at the end of the semester, but it's not difficult. The TA's are readily available if you need any help on anything. An 85% or higher in this course is considered an A, so there is a nice curve. Dr. Zhou posts exams for previous semesters, of which he reuses some questions. Attend lecture, take time on your labs, and you will do well in this class. ",1764
zhou_naijun,4,A,GEOG373,"Zhou is a pleasant professor. The other reviews are pretty accurate in that the material isn't too difficult, but you will definitely need to attend class and study if you want to understand the calculation/methods for the exams. He does his best to make sure everyone learns and will go through something again if people don't understand.

The lab portion of the class involves pretty much following instructions to do a lab, then doing a homework based on the lab. The lab practical is pretty difficult and in general most of the class has no idea how to do half of the practical because the labs don't prepare you for it all that well.

I would take another class with him though.

",1764
zhou_naijun,3,A,GEOG373,"The class is pretty straightforward-3 exams, each one non cumulative, plus the lab work.  Prof. Zhou can be a bit hard to understand and can drag on sometimes, but it's not too demanding of a class.  He posts the slides online, and he does give random quizzes in class, so make sure you attend as much as possible.  TA was pretty helpful, and labs aren't too bad if you put time into it.  Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time on the practical.  Quizzes are good hints for what will be on the exams.  I started out by not doing too well but managed to pull up my grade to an A after catching on to the class.  

Since I can't post two separate reviews, I'll just say a little bit about GEOG473, which is very similar.  The only difference is that there is no practical, there are only two exams, each of which is worth  a little bit more individually (44%, 22% each).  The labs are a little bit simpler actually and you don't have one due each week-instead there are five homeworks, with each homework consisting of several different labs.  Be sure to attend the labs so you can receive assistant from the TA, who was very helpful.  Also, even though powerpoints are posted on ELMS, attending lecture can be helpful, especially since there are random pop quizzes which provide hints of what is to come on the exams. As in Geog373, Zhou providse previous exams and outlines to guide your studies, which I recommend using.  ",1764
zhou_naijun,3,,GEOG306,"Tough to understand a lot of the time.  Gave ""attendance"" quizzes.  Pretty liberal on the exams, open books, open notes, even OPEN LAPTOP.  Course was graded with a curve, 85% was an A.",1764

Brian is a great person and teacher. He was always humble, kind, and humane, and he engaged the class with respect and enthusiasm. Even despite the attendance grade being dropped and it being a gen-ed during a COVID semester, people regularly showed up for class, even with cameras on sometimes, and they actually discussed the material. The course content is naturally very relatable, and it allows you to bring in your life experiences or make connections to other coursework, but it is also great because Brian structures the whole class around discussion with lecture content exceedingly rare in-class and with only short videos and readings each week, which he gives students Monday to watch and read in lieu of a class meeting. (There was also a reference book with assigned chapters, but I am convinced not a single soul read that, including myself. I skimmed some parts, and it seemed perfectly fine albeit too long-winded. The electronic formatting was very clumsy, but at least it was inexpensive.) 

Overall, I highly recommend taking this professor, whether it is for a gen-ed or you are intra-major. He certainly cares a lot for the material and has broad knowledge on it. His feedback was always thorough and useful. 

His assignments were frankly very light, but given COVID and it being an intro class, I do not think that is at all bad for the quality of education, and I think people will come out of the class impacted positively by all the conversations and readings, plus having practiced their writing a bit with the one major essay assignment. Essentially, we had 5 short reflection papers (1-2 pages, I believe), plus 2 short discussion leaderships, a participation grade (dropped), and a final paper. ",1769

Originally scheduled an exam for election day, but pushed back the exam date twice AND gave us an extra 10 minutes to take exam. Lectures are short, but informative. about 80% of the info is on his slides, but sometimes he says something important so I'd still recommend watching lecture. Every other lecture is synchronous (he still posts synchronous lectures after they're done), but attendance is optional for live sessions. There's a light HW load, and virtually no readings (no required text either). Very direct teaching style, no busy work or overly complicated explanations. I've learned so much already and we still have about a third of the semester left. Highly recommend. ",1785
zalewski,5,A,HESP411,"Professor Zalewxki is a great teacher. He's funny and makes class very comfortable. The test are EXACTLY FROM THE SLIDES! Literally memorize the slides and you'll ace the class. Anything in little print is a possible extra credit question. His third exam offers 15 points extra credit, and every other test offers about 10. He's reasonable, he responds back to your emails. Go to class because he takes it to heart if you don't come.",1786
byrne,4,A,PSYC436,"Easy class, great professor! If you study the slides, you will do well on the exams. The projects are informative and fun. Byrne connects all the lessons to real life events and tells you about all of her experiences. ",1787
byrne,5,A,PSYC436,Colleen is AMAZING.  Take any class you can with her.,1787
byrne,4,A-,PSYC436,"The class only has 4 homework assignments and 2 exams, so you really cannot mess up on anything. Overall, the material was interesting and the exams weren't too bad as long as you studied the PowerPoint slides. ",1787
vincent,4,A+,HONR259L,"Vincent is an interesting professor. If the course interests you, then you'll love it. The work definitely isn't hard. He'll tell you exactly what's going to be on the tests, and gives you the previous year's tests which basically mirror the exams you'll take. He brings in a lot of examples in class, like videos, that are fun to watch, and the latter half of the course is spent basically on student presentations. Pretty easy class to get an A in, in my opinion.",1790
vincent,4,A,HONR259L,"Class wasn't hard, the information was fairly easy to understand if you attended class. Goes over material and is willing to talk after class or during breaks about questions you have. There are two-three main test and on e very large project, and a few homework assignments for what your grade is based on. Not too bad if you are interested in the subject matter, super easy if you've learned about game theory probability already in an econ class. ",1790
vincent,2,A,,"Positives: Class is easy as hell.  Though an honors seminar, it required no reading.  Easy exams, easy homework. If you have a logical mind, you probably don't need to go to class. In total, I probably did about 10 hours of work outside class over the whole semester.

Negatives: Vincent is a pretty bad teacher. He reads off his powerpoints, which are not very descriptive, and rarely involves the class. Though he had a small room of 20 kids, it was like he was teaching a lecture hall of 200. Monotonous voice as well. HW sets are riddled with errors.",1790
vincent,2,A,ECON200,"Let's get this straight: Vincent is an awful professor. He reads off of his powerpoints (which have all been posted online in the beginning of the semester) and at some points, he even reads his jokes off of them! 

TAs are usually extremely unhelpful - seriously, you are on your OWN in this class. Read from the textbook, memorize it, and complete the problem sets - that's pretty much all you can do. I recommend him if you are prepared to teach yourself the basics of micro-economics. ",1790
vincent,3,A,ECON200,"Class is easy, but lecture might be one of the most difficult things to stay awake in. He is mind-blowingly BORING. I went to class 4 times (for the 3 tests & final) and discussion once and never returned - hopefully your TA speaks english but thats a 50/50 chance they wont. Doesnt matter though I did well on everything.
Review the slides you will be good. The weekly online homework is a necessary to ensure you will understand the concepts.",1790
vincent,5,A,ECON200,"I couldn't really tell you anything about the professor since I never went to class, but this class is one of the easiest you will take at maryland. The assignments are all online, and if you struggle the TA's for your discussion are very helpful. So I can say that he has a very organized class since I never had to go but knew what to expect on exams and how to do my homeworks. ",1790
vincent,1,W,HONR259L,"Most boring teacher ever!!!! Went to 3 classes and could not stay awake. Dropped the class, kept the textbook. Loved the subject.",1790
karol,2,A+,GVPT479K,"easy to do well in his class, but he's not a good professor, no guidelines for papers/assignments and doesn't respond to emails, I took his class because the topic seemed really interesting but if you want to get something out of class, don't waste your time with him",1792
karol,3,,GVPT474H,"Not a bad professor, but assigns a ton of readings each night. Really knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, but poorly timed assignments (i.e. a midterm exam one week and a 15 page paper due the next) and an excessive workload in my opinion. He also posted readings late (i.e. Wednesday morning for a Thursday class). If you can handle reading an upwards of 100 pages for each class meeting, you'll be fine",1792
rouse,1,,GVPT100,"I created an account on this website after using it for a few years and I saw Rouse's name pop up for an upper level government class. I had the opportunity to take my first class in the government program GVPT100 with this professor. It was one of the most miserable and stressful experiences of my freshman year. It made me question my choice of being a government major at UMD. I received a C in her class after working on it for hours each week. She was extremely ineffective in teaching the lessons and the coordination between her and the TA's was horrible. I retook gvpt100 my sophmore year and received an A with a different teacher that actually taught the class. Stella's shortfalls as a professor did not just reverberate with me, but with the entire class. After teacher evaluations, when UMD allowed teachers to view them before the course ended, she scolded the class because they were overwhelming negative as the entire class with fed up with her teaching methods. How unprofessional. Moreover she refused to post the notes for a 100 level lecture and while I went to class every 9am lecture I still couldn't copy her notes and draw all of the graphs within her impossible to follow time frame. 

 After this horrible experience with my first government class I decided to persevere and continue the major within UMD. My experiences have been great and the faculty has been exceptional in teaching the subject matter. As a student I strongly recommend you do NOT take a class with her. You will regret it and so will your GPA. ",1793
rouse,1,B,GVPT479D,"I understand that it was a 400-level class, but her expectations were far too high.  She didn't teach anything.  She would have us read about these research studies which requires you to have taken at least 2 statistics classes. 
Her grading is another story.  

She was very knowledgeable but in order to get any sort of real information from her you had to ask the questions.  She speaks 500 words per second and barely gives you enough time to copy down any sort of notes or anything.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU TAKE IT PASS FAIL BECAUSE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR GRADE.",1793
rouse,2,A-,GVPT170,"Professor Rouse is obviously very knowledgable on and passionate about her subject. But she definitely has the air of a professor who knows how smart they are, as she made it clear that everyone in the class should only contact her as last resort and she made some condescending comments. She has a strict no-technology policy and requires you to buy a clicker for the class, and there is always technical difficulties with the clickers, probably because we were in a 200 person lecture hall. She required us to read a textbook and a reader chapter every week, which equalled probably over a hundred very dry, long pages weekly - the reading expectations were absolutely ridiculous. You probably won't be able to get away without reading - I pretty much skimmed each 6-7 chapter section before the midterm and final. She refuses to post lecture slides online so that people who don't come to lecture (attendance is counted every day) can't see them, but (and this is important) SHE FILLS UP HER SLIDES WITH TONS OF INFORMATION AND GOES THROUGH THEM SO QUICK YOU WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO WRITE THEM DOWN. YOU WILL NOT GET EVERYTHING DOWN. AND SHE WILL NOT POST THE SLIDES. You might be able to get away with recording lectures on your phone but its a pain in the ass considering the strict no-tech policy. She talks a million miles an hour as well. The class wasn't a huge deal for me as a GVPT major (and this being a requirement), so if you end up her in class and have to be there like me, it will be manageable, considering you have a more natural talent/understanding for gov. But DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER FOR ONE MEASLY GEN ED IF YOU ARE NOT A GVPT MAJOR. It definitely won't be worth it.",1793
rouse,1,B,,"She is probably the worst professor you will ever have, please NEVER take her class!!",1793
yager,4,B+,PSYC301,"Okay, I'd just like to clear the air regarding the Biological Basis of Behavior. This class receives a lot of negative attention that it doesn't receive. I won't lie, this class is VERY challenging and you have to work your ass off if you even want to break a 80%. Yager can be a little dry at times, but overall, I enjoyed going to class. The material is very interesting - then again, I love the brain. With this class, it's very B.S.-geared and not very B.A.-geared; it really depends on what you're trying to do in the psych field, so take that into consideration. He offers extra credit, but lets be real, it doesn't do shit. EC is offered in the form of little weekly lecture quizzes on ELMS that you have unlimited attempts to score a 100% on. If you get a 100, you get 1 extra point on the exam. But in reality, when you only have about 3-5 quizzes per lecture exam (and the exam is already 130+ points), 3-5  extra points don't really make that much of a difference percentage-wise, especially since the quizzes aren't easy. Okay, so the big thing is exams. I swear sometimes he's trying to kill you in these exams, but they're not impossible. Getting an A is doable, but you better know that material like the back of your hand. The good thing about exams is that he drops the lowest score and they're all curved. I got a 85, 63, 84, and a 92 on the final, and that ended up giving me a 88 overall in the class (B+), when in reality, my uncurved grade would probably be a B-. Oh yeah, and your grade is just based on tests. There are no other assignments, but that being said, getting a B in this class is not impossible. Hard, but you can do it if you're motivated and put in the work. You really get the grade you deserve in this class. SOOOOOO takeaway: it's hard, but don't listen to the people that defame Yager and the class in general. Most of these people try to put off studying until the night before and think that they'll pass and then end up failing and/or they're not interested in the material, and misattribute their bad time to bad teaching. It's bullshit. I highly recommend this course for anyone in the B.S. track. It'll really help you in the long run. ",1795
yager,4,,PSYC301,"If you are concerned with getting a good grade, I would suggest taking another professor for this course. I took this class last semester with Dr.Hall and got A's on first two exams before I had to drop course for personal reasons. Was not easy but if you study hard and make sure you know all of the study guide, you should do well. This semester with Yager, I got a very low E on first exam(lol). His material is different and focuses more on what seems like training to become a doctor. I think his tests are unfair with irrelevant or miscellaneous questions. However he is very knowledgeable and very interesting. If you take his class, pay a lot of attention in class and take extremely good notes. ",1795
yager,2,B,PSYC407,"This course is the epitome of why the minor is as a whole a useless endeavor that should be avoided for the supplement of actual research ( See the Phenomena of Psyc300 being absolutely useless for teaching research). You'll waste at the average 12 hours of life that you could use for work in a research lab or hwk/real science each week and write lab reports that are in effect glorified narratives of what was conducted in lab. The lab rarely demands an actual understanding of biology and in fact is all about knowing the minimal foundation, going into the lab and doing lab work that is as you guessed it minimalistic. 
The class teaches basic 'neuroscience techiques' which really are just classic (See: useless) techniques that give you a very minimal understanding of electrophysiology in response to sensory stimuli (This course should be renamed Sensory Neuroscience Lab because there's little behavior actually studied and more principles of supposed circuits firing to supposed ganglians to cause supposed sterotyped behavior that we in majority do not get to see). We use a program (Chart) that is worse than anything on this Earth and generally we can all accept that we learn absolutely nothing in lab other than the pain of learning that we made a massive mistake attempting to finish this minor. And in lecture we are taught what I would call very much minor brush strokes of biology, we genuinely learn a minor amount of the biology of an organism just enough to do the lab but not actually understand the very fundamental information necessary to know anything worthwhile.
So in short if you want to take a course where you pretend you've learned something. Go ahead, if you actually want to do neuroscience go join a research lab. I know that if I could go back I wouldn't do this course, it taught me absolutely nothing about neuroscience that I wanted to know. 

So if I were to break it down into ratings (1 to 5)
Professor: 4/5
Materials in lab ( In 301 you're taught all about these magical methods and now you're using metal toothpicks for electrodes) : 1/5
Time Spent efficiently learning: 1/5
Way Course is tested: 1/5



Conclusion: Do something else with your life. ",1795
yager,5,A+,PSYC301,"While I will not say that this is an easy course for most students, I had taken a graduate level neuroanatomy before and helped the students in my section with review sessions. Greg is helpful, but he doesn't go over the material a second time and neither Dr.Yager nor Greg will give you hints to memorize things. I still have my notes/review guides if anyone should need them, and if anyone needs any help, feel free to reach me!",1795
yager,4,C,PSYC301,"This man knows what he's talking about. Awesome, interesting class...no doubts about these statements. But if you want an A you better know that material INSIDE AND OUT. Very conceptual course, not detail oriented. His exams are very hard. Koofers helps out a lot, but do not fully depend on it. Usually he uses the same diagrams and short essays as koofers, at least. Going to class and paying attention is a must if you want to fully understand the material. Dont ever underestimate his exams. I made this class my main focus and still received a C. If you enjoy neuroscience or are used to taking courses in the physical sciences, it clearly is much easier. 
Bottom line: one of the most interesting courses you will ever take, but involves an immense amount of effort. Although i received a C, i do not regret taking this course. Yager is awesome.",1795
yager,5,A,HONR209O,"Dr. Yager is fantastic! This was my favorite honors seminar out of all 5 that I took. It was insanely interesting. It really does change the way you think about sleeping. Yager does a really great job teaching it - he's very relaxed and doesn't bullshit you. He also brought in a real brain for us to look at! Overall I really really loved this class. We had to do one paper about a book but he let us hand it in early if we wanted and he reviewed it for us and gave it back so we could definitely get an A. Dr. Yager is funny, blatantly intelligent, and very sincere. I highly recommend this seminar if you are even remotely interested in the brain or psychology. ",1795
yager,5,A,HONR209O,"Dr. Yager is a great professor, both knowledgeable and engaging. If the class is talkative, then the lectures become very enjoyable to attend. 
Take this class at your own risk however, for it is very hard to get an A, not so much because the material itself is hard, but because his grading is rather tough. If you dont have exactly what he wants you will lose points...a lot of points. And make sure take good notes and attend every lecture. You can read the light blue book to get a general understanding, but know that whatever extra information you grab from this book will not be worth a thing if you write it as part of an answer on his tests...unless you get it wrong.. then it will cost you points.
What Ive learned in this class is just phenomenal and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the importance of sleep with many aspects of college life.  
I have to say.. unlike some other classes.. ex. orgo, calcIII... this class is actually interesting.
PS... best thing to do is to just go listen in... learn the stuff... and not fret about getting an unsatisfactory grade.",1795
yager,3,C,HONR209O,"Basically, if you want an easy A, if you're a non-science major, or if you need an honors seminar, I don't recommend taking this class. 
Typically honors seminars are supposed to kind of be an easy A; not this one. You have to take copious amounts of notes, study hard, and have an intuition for science to get a decent grade. 
The lectures are fine, a little boring, but the videos and information are interesting enough. Just make sure you take a ton of notes because that's your main study tool.
The tests are difficult. They consist of 5-7 questions based on broad topics discussed and repeated in class, but then you have to apply a bunch of details and connect it all to get points on the answers. You definitely need to study for them.
There's also the ten page paper which, if you're a good writer and can look past the surface meaning of the book, should be fairly easy to write. 
The in-class discussions for the weekly papers can be painful. There seemed to be the same 4-5 students talking each week. Conversation is difficult to stimulate because sometimes it seems like no one wants to talk. 
Overall, this class was difficult, especially for an honors seminar. If you're a science major and are interested in this subject matter, it'll probably be a lot easier for you than it was for me. ",1795
yager,5,A,PSYC401,"This was probably the best psychology course I have taken in the department so far. I wanted to review it because there aren't any other reviews. This class is unlike other lab classes where the lab supplements the lecture. Instead, the lecture provides background information, and the main focus is information gained in lab.
The labs are 4 hours long, and sometimes they go long - they expect you to stay, so don't plan anything after this lab. The longest lab we had went for 6 hours! At the time it seemed horrible, but I really learned a lot looking back on it. The last lab of the semester is the best one. You get to perform brain surgery on a frog and record neural pulses straight from the optic tectum (part of the brain that integrates visual information). Recording action potentials and other things you learn about in other psychology classes you actually get to do in this course! I would recommend to anyone - just be prepared to do a lengthy lab write-up each week. It truly a science course.",1795
yager,4,,PSYC301,"For Psyc301 you HAVE to go to class because his slides are just pictures and he just talks for the whole 65 minutes. He is a good lecturer and knows his stuff really well, but as others have said his exams are definitely rough. The multiple choice had an answer choice for a, b, and c, choice d was all of the above and choice e was answer choice a and c. Definitely know everything he puts on the review sheet and try to look at things in the big picture. It's a hard class, but the material is actually really interesting. 

Also, I would suggest using Terpnotes from bookholders because someone took amazing notes that are very similar to what he teaches now. I heard that is first exam was on koofers too, but I'm not sure if that is true.",1795
yager,4,B-,HONR209O,"Professor Yager is very knowledgable and very passionate, but he tends to be a bit boring in his lectures (I dozed off in his class every time except for once). The exams are pretty challenging, but they're fair if you study. Take notes on everything he says, because that's what's tested. And READ THE BOOKS (especially the blue one). I didn't read the books all year, and my friend pointed that there were helpful bullet lists and things like that.

Bottom line: Interesting material, very interesting if you're a psych or bio major. Involves a lot for critical thinking. If you're looking for an easy A, look elsewhere. Recommended with caution.",1795
yager,3,,PSYC301,"Yager was good in the sense that he knew the material well, but he's the type of prof who's only there for his research. He doesn't really care as much as he should for his students. I went to him several times for help and it didn't help at all. His exams are horrible, like they come straight from hell. It doesn't matter if you know everthing he said in class. You HAVE to know extra miscellaneous stuff and have to know how to apply your knowledge to the bigger picture. He really knows his stuff...that's why the exams get so hard.

Overall, he's not worth it. He might be able to explain stuff in class, but he won't help you a lot during reviews and the exams are HELL. Don't do it to yourself.",1795
yager,5,B,PSYC301,Dr. Yager is an excellent and knowledgeabe professor! He communicates the information well and makes the class interesting.

yager,5,B,HONR209O,"Very interesting class. The material gets better for the last 2/3 of the class. Presentations are difficult to get an A. Exams are not bad but need good notes.

yager,5,A-,PSYC301,"Dr. Yager is an excellent professor. He is very knowledgeable in his field and explains concepts very well. He says A LOT in class, so you'll need to be ready to take good notes and write down everything he says, but the book is just supplemental, he never tests on anything from the book that he didn't mention in class.  There are 3 tests (you can drop the lowest) and a cumulative final, but there are no papers or other work. Tests require a lot of studying, and you need to be able to expand on what you know. He also holds reviews before exams which are very helpful. Fascinating class, difficult, but very satisfying.",1795
yager,4,,HONR209O,the professor is a nice enough guy and knowledgable (except for the astonishing amount that he seems not to know things in the field of sleep... which he probably should?) and the class is interesting but definitly an annoyance because of the note taking and the epic paper. it is true if youre not going to be a neuroscientist or whatever and youre looking for an easy A... DONT DO IT.,1795

yager,3,B,HONR209O,"Warning: If you're an honors student looking for an easy, interesting honors seminar, just stop reading now and go take the multiverse one, or multiple me's.

This class was, overall, an interesting class. Sleep was always something interesting to me (both from a scientific standpoint and from an experiential one), and I greatly looked forward to to the class. I soon found out, though, that though the information was definitely interesting, the class was going to be a lot harder than I'd thought.
First off, my main gripe is that the class is almost completely-discussion based - he spends every class going over information in his slides, trying to get people involved, but then gives absolutely zero percentage of your grade from participation. 
Your grade will consist of 40% two midterms, 30% the final, 20% two scientific paper presentations, and 10% a 10-page paper.

So first off, the tests. Make sure you take good notes, because if you don't you'll basically be screwed for the midterms, because he'll ask you specific things from the lecture, like 'list all the ways sleep inertia is bad to society' and if you don't list everything, you're screwed. On the tests, make sure you answer everything in bullet format, because it's the fastest, easiest way to answer, and it's what he wants anyway (even if he doesn't specifically tell you). If you answer a question, no matter how much you've written, as long as you write the specific things he's looking for, you get full credit. No matter how much you BS an answer, if you don't include the specific answers he wants, it won't matter.
The final was similar format to the tests, you just have a lot more time to do it. Also, he included some extra credit on the final just to boost your grade, but even then, be prepared for B's and C's on the tests, or if you're 'that guy' maybe a low A.

For the paper presentations: every week a different group gives a presentation on a scientific paper that he posts online, and everyone will have to do two of these. For this, what he's looking for is basically that you spend 5 minutes max explaining the paper and its outcomes and everything, and that for the next 10-15 minutes the class will be engaged in good discussion on it, thanks to your amazing leadership abilities you are expected to have. Make sure you have friends in the class who you have convinced ahead of time to get involved in the discussion, and whatever you do, don't say anything to try to get the discussion going unless you absolutely have to. If you do that well, you can expect an easy A for that 20%, but if not be ready for B's and B-'s. 

As for the paper, it's actually 8-10 pages, on one of the books you'll be assigned. There's absolutely no research necessary, and the book it's on is actually a (pretty interesting) novel about this sleep clinic, so you'll basically be writing a literary analysis on it. Do with this what you can, and though you'll have a lot of time to do it, don't push it off or you'll feel the consequences.

Overall, I'd say I enjoyed the class (though the lecture style did start to get old), and did learn a lot about an interesting subject I hadn't actually known much about, but I do wish the class had had some sort of a participation grade, because otherwise no one has incentive to participate, and it's the same 3 people taking over and over.",1795
yager,4,B-,HONR209O,"While this course is extremely interesting and you will learn a ton, it will not help your GPA in any way. The exams are very difficult to do well on, even with hours of studying. Dr. Yager is not a gentle grader. The tests are all free response, so you have to know the content like the back of your hand, and mind you, the content is based on detailed neurobiology. If you're not into biology, I would steer clear.  To succeed in this course, you have to attend every lecture, take precise notes on everything Dr. Yager says (his powerpoints are absolutely barebones), and complete every assignment with 100% effort. There is absolutely no room for slack in this class. Not the honors seminar for you if you want an easy A.

That being said, it is a super interesting course, and it is possible to get a good grade if you are on it from the beginning. Dr. Yager is brilliantly smart and presents the content in an engaging way. Definitely a challenging course, but overall I like it. ",1795

I went to every weekly review session with the TA, every review session led by Yager before exams and only missed one lecture throughout the semester. I also studied for 10+ hours (not exaggerating) for each exam. That being said, this class can be really interesting if you are prepared to work hard. ",1795
yager,5,A,PSYC309U,"Dr. Yager is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is genuinely passionate about what he's teaching and actually cares about his students - the couple of times I went to office hours, he asked about my other classes and my plans for the future, not just his class. 
That being said, this class is NOT easy. Even after taking detailed notes and going to every lecture, I found myself struggling on tests (not because they were unfair, but because there were just so many small details we needed to know). The weekly journals were also kind of a pain and seemed rather unnecessary, especially when they were graded pretty harshly for such small assignments. There is a decent curve, and the things discussed in the class are incredibly interesting, so it is definitely worth taking. ",1795

Do NOT take this class if you are not interested at all in brain science; it requires a certain level of interest and passion to do well. Yager is super nice and helpful, but do not rely too heavily on email communication.

Attend every lecture! While Dr. Berndtson posts her lecture slides on ELMS, she blocks out a lot of the important information that's only shown in class. Also, she gives the exam layouts and debate/presentation formats only during lecture. Also, there are reading quizzes that are free points since they are participation. Lastly, during finals, if you skip class on days that other groups are presenting, she will knock your grade down hard (happened to one of my group members). 

Overall the class is easy, but there aren't many assignments, so make sure you and your group puts full effort in every assignment. Also, study well for the exams! They are completely based on what's taught in lecture so review the notes well. ",1797
berndtson,4,A,GEOG330,"Her lectures were really well done. Her exams were quite fair , the only issue is some of the essays and sources required for example felt quite excessive. She assigned alot of readings too, but you did not really need to do them to do well.",1797
bernat_edward,5,A-,PSYC300,"What a cutie, can’t get enough of him. His pony tail is very adorable. He uses multiple slide shows instead of using one, which is strange. But it works. ",1798
iwamoto,4,A,PSYC432,"Professor Iwamoto really cares about his students and offers advice for graduate school. That being said, the class itself was poorly structured. The first half of the semester was relatively easy with a couple of writing assignments and a midterm, but the second half of the semester involved having writing assignments almost every week, finishing a group presentation project, and the final exam. It's definitely doable, but takes a lot of time management. His rubrics for long essays and the group presentation were a little vague and confusing, but he does offer 2% extra credit. ",1801
liang_shunlin,3,B,,"The class is not a huge amount of work. If you want to receive an A though, it is nearly impossible unless you are EXTREMELY lucky, and very studious. Class has 3 or 4 quizzes which ask 5 or 6 free response questions. You must write random facts that he doesn't ask for or else you get a bad grade. Most people would receive C's and D's. Some B's and one A usually. There were also group presentation, and research paper, and discussion participaiton counting for the rest of your grade. Keep in mind that you will never know what grades you received on anything but the quizzes. He puts a curve in so almost everyone gets a B, and a few slackers get C's and a few lucky ones get A's.

I would suggest avoiding this class if you don't like dealing with not knowing your grades, but I would encourage it if you are looking to learn a decent amount on China.",1803
liang_shunlin,3,,,"The course was on China, and the content was interesting and useful. However, he doesn't appear to care much about lecturing and class structure. His quizzes were more like full-scale tests. They were comprised of six essay questions in which you had to include just the right facts, or you would get marked down. The rubric was terrible and nearly impossible to score A's on. You never knew what the expectations were, though he said he will curve the grade. He didn't give us our grades back on our group presentations either. Take his class for the knowledge and an easy day, but don't expect him to put effort into it.",1803
selterman,1,C+,PSYC100,"He claims to be on the students side, but in reality has 0 consideration for them.",1804
selterman,5,A,PSYC221,"People have a lot of bad things to say about Selterman, I'm not sure why. Sure he's a little cocky, but he's a fine teacher, and knows what he's talking about mostly. As for the horrible blended learning assignments everyone talks about, of the 3 out of 4 I did, I got a perfect score on 2 and a couple points deducted on one for not doing hanging indentions in my bibliography. They are really not that difficult if you just make sure they are formatted perfectly. Also, exams are a little tough but he literally lets you retake them and get points back two days later, THE EXACT SAME EXAM. So don't let people scare you lol, if you do the bare minimum you will get at least an A-, and a lot of extra credit is offered.",1804
selterman,1,,PSYC221,"Dr. Selterman thinks he's a good teacher, and thinks he's ""on our side."" But really, he is so against you. He does not want to work with his students in any way. He doesn't accept late work, due dates are ridiculous, like May 1st at 12:01am instead of April 30 at 11:59. So many people in my class was confused by this and missed the deadline and he had no sympathy and didn't accept late work. Never answers emails. TA's are sarcastic and think you're dumb. He leaves everything up to his TA's including grading. All he does is walk in, lecture, walk out. Doesn't like to answer questions and almost gets offended when you ask questions. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS WHATEVER YOU DO. Also, the grading and syllabus make 0 sense. ",1804
selterman,3,,PSYC221,"He really isn't all that. In his syllabus he says he is really open to talking about grades but in reality he wont change a thing. There were multiple occasions that I thought a grade was unfair and yes he was open to discuss it but the whole time he was very stubborn and i knew nothing i was going to say was going to change his mind. Also he gives a few extra credit assignments and on elms they are not dated so it makes it seem like you can turn it in whenever because he also never brings them up in class but you have to look at the syllabus because it will have a due date in there. That was annoying because nobody really knew about it and ended up missing the opportunity, so read his syllabus even though its so long. Over all he isn't a bad teacher, just a pretty harsh grader and doesn't really budge when asking for a grade change.",1804
selterman,1,A,PSYC221,"Professor Selterman is an egotistical teacher and I would not recommend his class to my worst enemy. His lecture slides are not easy to read, he cannot explain terms for his life and his exam questions, BLA essays and busywork assignments are graded unfairly and harshly. Not to mention the lack of email response, and when he finally does response, he is not helpful, in fact I was completely offended by the harsh and rude tone of the reply. Although the content covered in class is not difficult, Prof. Selterman does not explain the material very well and he always brings the lecture back upon himself. If you want to get to understand D-Money (as he calls himself) and his life experiences, then by all means this is the class for you. However, if you want to take a course that will educate you, this is NOT the course for you. In addition, there was one article in particular that he assigned for the reading that was offensive. The article was called, ""– Is There Anything Good About Men?"" Not only was this article offensive, explaining that feminism is the reason for the wage gap in America, but this article has absolutely no connection to the material learned in class. It was an article that just shows his student what a patriarchal jerk ""D-Money"" really is. Not only was this article offensive, but his ""I know better than all of you"" attitude really disabled a good learning environment throughout the class. All in all, if you want to be taught by a know it all jerk who thinks way too highly of himself, this is a class for you. ",1804
selterman,3,,PSYC221,"Professor Selterman is very pretentious. Although he's nice and tries to make the lectures interesting, it was overall not a pleasant class. The Blended Learning assignments killed everyone's grade (including mine) although that is more the fault of the TA's than him (which is why I gave him three stars). They were entirely too much effort for the grades received regardless of how good the papers turned in were. As a Psychology major, I did not expect the class to be this difficult. The content was not but the way it was handled and assessed made it so. I took a 300-level psychology class last semester and was taught more about writing and APA format which makes no sense since this is basically an introductory level class. When I went to his Office Hours to request personal help on improving my Blended Learning grades, he rushed out at the end telling us he had somewhere to be…it would have been nice of him to warn us at the beginning of the hours so we would know. When I did have my one-on-one meeting with him, he did not do much to help and once again, was in a rush because he had somewhere to be.
I would definitely not recommend Dr. Selterman for a GenEd class. If you want to hear about how he apparently knows everyone in the social psychology world and all of their research, this is the class for you.",1804
selterman,5,,PSYC221,"AWESOME PROFESSOR! I absolutely loved going to class simply because Selterman made everything so easy to understand, I'd even say it was fun! The class itself was pretty interesting.

My only complaint was this class was a 'Blended Learning' course. Meaning every other Friday, half of the class wouldn't come to class but have an online assignment due by Sunday and the other half would come to class and complete an assignment based off of what was discussed in class. Every Friday the groups would switch. The TA's graded the online Blended Learning assignments EXTREMELY HARSHLY! They took off a good portion of points for the littlest things such as citations and references. 

Other than the BL assignments, grading was very fair. The tests are easy if you thoroughly fill out his study guides. He gives lots of extra credit opportunities as well :)",1804
selterman,1,,PSYC221,"I took this class looking at the previous reviews and I wish I had dropped it during the add/drop period. Psych221 is awful Selterman just lectures to the class and the blended learning assignments are very frustrating because the TAs will randomly change the rubric without telling the students and you will get points off for no reason. Selterman does not understand that everyone in PSYC221 is NOT a psychology major, especially since it is a CORE class, not a psych major requirement class, and refuses to help students who are having difficulties with the assignments. It's almost as if he has a vendetta against non-psych majors. Don't waste your time on this class it is not worth it. Exams are fairly easy and you get a lot of extra credit opportunity but trust me it is not worth the headache. ",1804
selterman,3,A-,PSYC221,"Dr. Selterman is that young lad who worked really hard during his college years, got his doctorate and now thinks he is the infallible expert of social psychology and writing. When you talk to him there is this aura of 'I am better than you, just look at my big fancy degree'. 

He assigns you papers and grades it as if you were writing for the Journal of Social Psychology. I am an English major and I consistently got B's on his ridiculous writing assignments. Points would be deducted for a missing comma or improper use of a colon. If I wanted to take an English class, I would have taken an english class! 

There is also the material. It starts out very interesting until you realize your entire job in the class is to memorize definitions. To study for the final you literally just sitting down at your desk open wikipedia and your glossary and read through it until your mind is numb.

His exams are also the most inconsistent I have ever seen. Exam one will be a walk in the park, but all of a sudden if he thinks you're getting just a bit too smart he will write the second exam with failure in mind. It was still passable, but for an introductory, 200-level class, it was completely unfair.

So, if you are willing to put up with the worst possible system for grading papers, constant reading to keep up with the mountain of materials you will have to memorize and probably the most incompetent group of TAs then take Selterman, in fact, I encourage it. But if not, take Curtis....or talk to a squirrel on the mall. 
",1804
selterman,5,A,PSYC334,"Selterman's awesome. He grades pretty fairly and the exams aren't too bad as long as you go over the lecture slides. He gives random writing exercises that count as attendance grades, but there are only a few--you just never know when one will come up.

Last year for another class a lot of people didn't really read the book and did fine, but for 334 this semester he definitely got some exam material from the book. 

You get extra credit for going to office hours and doing SONA studies. Grading is a little harsher on the papers.

Power point slides are always up right before class",1804
selterman,5,A,PSYC221,"Awesome guy! Really interesting teacher with fun anecdotes. Very fair, gives extra credit; if you have any problems just email him and he's more than happy to help! If you go in to his office hours for help or just to chill he gives you extra credit. just saying. 

His exams are relatively straight forward with extra credit opportunity on the exam. Exams are half multiple choice and about 6 short answer (meaning REALLY short answer. like 2-3 sentences) and doesn't usually take the whole class

I personally never really read the book for this class; just go to lecture and make sure you listen to what he says because the stuff on the slides are just topics for most of it; he elaborates a lot more during lecture. He also does spot check participation during class...so go to lecture!",1804
selterman,5,A,PSYC221,"-really nice guy, definitely cares about his students' concerns
-gives out many opportunities for extra credit
-posts ppt slides right before the class starts
-slides aren't the most helpful slides I've ever seen since they don't give as much important information compared to what he says and what the books says, so READ THE BOOK and listen to him
-grades fairly; exams are fair",1804
selterman,5,A,PSYC221,"Dr. Selterman is the only professor I've had this semester that has been reasonable, efficient, and responsive to student concerns. Unlike many others he is actually focused on his students learning material in a way that will allow them to use it in their own lives. 

He's pretty good with having information about assignments and grades online on time, and is more than happy to help out whether it's during office hours or not.  

Selterman doesn't make you feel like you have to do everything perfectly--he makes it clear that so long as you work hard and put in effort, you will get a good grade, and he actually follows through with that. 


He is able to admit when he makes a grading mistake and fixes it on time. 
Class was fun and he isn't unreasonably harsh if you need to skip a few times for legitimate reasons. 

This class is the only one I even feel motivated to study hard for the final because I know it will pay off.

Also, he gives pretty good life advice",1804
selterman,4,A+,PSYC289D,"I was very skeptical of taking Selterman for this class after reading reviews that he was egotistical and not very helpful. After taking this class I feel like the complete opposite of those people. The only time Selterman talked about himself was on the first day introducing himself or if someone asked a question about his research and when I had a question he answered promptly and was very helpful. This class is very interesting and you learn a lot of useful things to know. Selterman is a good lecturer and knows the content really well. My only criticisms is he shows up late to class often and when we have class discussions he sometimes prolongs it which made some classes a drag.  Your grade comprises of a term paper, exams, short weekly reflections, and clicker participation. There is a ton of extra credit offered in this class that takes minimal effort to do. Take advantage of it! Exams were not too bad since he allows you to get points back with a follow up. Averages for midterms were 85 and 95, final average was 80.",1804
selterman,1,A,PSYC221,"He's not understanding or ethical. You can study his ppts, but the tests are more focused on the readings. He words questions on the test alot harder than they need to be. He doesn't even go over them. Essay assignments are also graded pretty harshly. It's alot for just a 200 class. Please take Curtis if you want to take this course",1804
selterman,3,A+,,"So-so. There is definitely that divide between professor and students. Tests can be confusing, need to study a good amount. ",1804
selterman,4,B+,PSYC221,"Professor Selterman is a pretty solid professor. He is organized with the schedule of the material we learn and he emphasizes how he wants his class to be manageable. The only issue I had with him was his resistance to accommodate my learning differences in needing to be seated in the front. He treated my accommodation as a sort of inconvenience that wasn't really important to him. Otherwise, he's pretty easy to talk to and friendly. ",1804
selterman,5,A+,PSYC221,"I don't understand why a lot of people seem to hate him? His lectures were very clear and he posted recordings on them on ELMS. The readings were also pretty straightforwards, but they were also long so I used an audio app to make it read it to me while I did other stuff. The tests were okay, but for every exam other than the final, you had the chance to take it again with your notes for possible extra credit points. Speaking of which, he offers A LOT of extra credit, I finished the class with a 103 (originally a 93 before EC was added). My only complaint was that his TA was really strict with commas on writing assignments.",1804
selterman,1,C-,PSYC289D,"!!!PLEASE READ!!!
Dylan claims that he is on the students' sides, however he couldn't care less. He agreed to let us submit an alternate assignment for Exam 2 and I submitted a publisher doc to elms on the due date. However, he took 20 days to put grades out on ELMS, which ended up being the start of finals week. I checked ELMS and I received a 0/100 on the exam assignment and a comment that simply said ""I can't view your submission. You created a file from Microsoft Publisher but did not print as PDF or other readable document."" That's it. Since when is a Microsoft publisher document unreadable? He waited 20 days to even look at the file I submitted and then left me with a zero for Exam 2 right at the beginning of finals week. As any good student, I messaged him and said ""I understand that the syllabus says there is a zero-tolerance policy for this kind of work because, in the past, students have tried to purposefully do this in order to buy more time to make changes and perfect their assignment. However, this was never my intentions and, if needed, I have proof that my original Microsoft Publisher assignment that was uploaded a day early has not been modified since the day I submitted it, which was April 25th, 2019 at exactly 10:00 pm."" I was in no way trying to cheat the system and buy myself more time for the assignment. I had proof too! However, he responded and said that students have also found ways to hack into their Microsoft system and change that ""last modified"" date on files. I was crushed; I was very scared for my grade at this point, so I asked to meet with him and discuss it in person and he agreed to do it on the third to last day of finals week after the class final. We talked about it and he did not budge or try to reason with me. At this point he was just being stubborn. I am currently trying to speak with the head of the Psyc department because I think that this is extremely unfair. In the midst of chaos, I went onto ELMS to find some extra credit opportunities and I completed a three-hour extra credit research assignment and submitted it and emailed him that I completed it. His response: ""the Open Mind module was not assigned this semester. It was not required, nor was it available for extra credit."" If it wasn't available for extra credit, then WHY is it on ELMS under ""Extra Credit""!?!?!?!? Nothing that he does makes sense and he never tried to show any mercy or meet me in the middle with these issues. I was a good student in his class and did all the assignments and he still wouldn’t reason with me. It is currently finals week and the combination of study stress with Selterman's spontaneous and excuses that he pulls from thin air has pushed me over the top. I have never felt so helpless in a course in my entire life. For a Psychology of Happiness class, he sure knows how to spread the joy. 100% would NOT recommend.

selterman,3,B+,PSYC100,"You can tell Selterman knows what he's talking about when he teaching during lecture. His exams are application based and are very tricky. However, exams are weighted less than the worksheets that we have to do every week, which take about 3 hours to do. I would do as well as possible on those quizzes, so the exam grades won't affect you as much. The class is interesting, but the workload kind of ruins it. It's not an easy A type class. ",1804
selterman,1,,PSYC221,"This professor claims to care about his students when he really does not. He is rude and dismissive and has a huge ego. The TA's grade every paper in this class. His lectures are boring, yet you have to pay attention to get every detail for the tests because his slides have no information whatsoever. Not a terribly hard class, but if you have the option please go with another teacher. Selterman isn't worth the headache and pain of taking this class. ",1804
selterman,2,A,PSYC221,"Overall I disliked Selterman. His lectures all felt robotic, and he was extremely unhelpful with explaining any of the assignments for the class. He made it much more difficult then it should have been. You have to write a scientific analysis essay every other week and is graded very specifically and overall difficult to write. If it wasn't for the TA, I would've never passed this class.  I will say if you show up for class and participate with the clickers, you will get a TON of extra credit in the end that actually boosted my grade up by two letter grades. I would not recommend taking this class unless required.",1804

Yes, it was a different assignment that was not like anything I've done before but if you thoroughly read the instruction, look at the sample and ask a TA to proof read it then you'll be fine. Class was also divided into two groups and each group attend discussion on alternate weeks. ",1804

selterman,2,A,PSYC221,"I had his class fully online, and what a ride it was. The coursework wasn't really difficult (participation questions and a weekly activity/essay), and we didn't have exams either. What sucked is that I literally didn't learn a single thing in his class, as everything he covered was material that is taught in PSYC100 or AP Psych. He has a huuuuge ego and will not respond if something questions what he is presenting (like if you were to propose a theory that contradicted his own- he would straight up pretend like you didn't type or say anything). I also noticed that he didn't really address anyone in his class who had a more complex or foreign name, which was incredibly disheartening to see. Overall I am giving two stars because the workload itself wasn't that bad and I liked his cats; he seriously needs to work on actually connecting with his students and teaching new material.",1804
selterman,4,A+,PSYC100,"Very good professor and he is obviously very aware of what's going on with the pandemic and how to ensure that his students can hold open discussions about what is going on in the world. He gives a lot of extra credit assignments. As long as you do your work on time and complete extra credit assignments, you should get an A in this class. He is a bit egotistical about some philosophies as others have mentioned but overall, he is a very well-spoken professor. The same goes for his TAs",1804

However, unfortunately he is very quick to report students to the OSC over minor similarities found using turnitin.com, as helpful as this website can be, it can't be too heavily relied on for student work, especially when the professor specifically states that proper APA format and references aren't required for these 400-500 word essays, not just that, neither him nor my TA contacted me beforehand to clarify the situation. I'm sure he's great in an offline setting, but online, he jumps to conclusions and has power trips if you bring up how harshly a TA may grade your papers. I will also be taking his PSYC234 class next semester when we're fully back on campus so hopefully I'll have a better review.",1804

It is quite IMPORTANT that you do those pre-lecture SmartBook assignments. I usually just do them right before the class starts because I'm lazy as f. But I think these SmartBook assignments are more important than the after class HW and gave a good general understanding for incoming lecture, it usually takes me less than a hour to finish them and she already highlighted all the important stuff on the assignment's reading part, just take notes from the highlighted paragraphs and bring them to lecture then you would find yourself follow her lecture drastic easily. Her mob lab extra credits are easy points to get if you follow my previous advice. And GSS sessions are also helpful btw especially before the exam. Her midterms are not hard at all if you do her practice exams, I mean literally we had 2 graph problems that we need to do ourselves then the next 30 or so questions are just multiple choices, and I appreciate she often do not test us on those controversial and theoretical questions. She is very reachable after class and have confidence in yourself, I'm writing this as I'm holding a 1.7 cumulative GPA, this class is not hard compare to other science courses I had at UMD, there is no nasty number and confusing formulas that you need to memorize, a good understanding of the demand and supply curve is sufficient enough.

Only real ""complaints"" would be that the exams have a high weight but this is college so nothing surprising there!

mccauley_john,5,A,GVPT289L,"Prof McCauley is the man. GVPT289L was one of the favorite courses I took in college. McCauley is a very talented and charismatic lecturer. He learns the name of all the students in the class early on, despite the lecture being fairly large. Each lecture is a different topic relating to government and religion where he surveys different views and opinions and sometimes builds an argument. Often he tries to make a novel point that is interesting and thought provoking. Week to week the class has very little work. There are a couple of interesting readings each week. 25% of the grade is based on participation during discussion section. My TA made sure that everyone participated so that they got 100%. There is a midterm based on class material and readings that is pretty straightforward. The big assignment for the class is a essay on any topic you want that relates to government and religion. McCauley is genius because he basically wants to limit the amount of work in the class and just give students the ability to explore their passions and write their own essay. I thought that it was a pretty cool opportunity. However, you may not like it as much if you don't like writing. I highly recommend this class with McCauley.",1817

I would no doubt retake his class, really no words can describe how great of a professor he is. ",1822
shaffer_l_jen,5,A+,ANTH266,"She is a really fun professor. Talks about the material and loves when students come to office hours just to talk. Easy class if you follow the rubric for papers, and no exams!",1824
shaffer_l_jen,5,,ANTH266,"She's passionate about the material that she teaches, I love that.  No final exam... just a large project.  In class participation is a large portion of your grade so attendance is required.  Loved this class!",1824
shaffer_l_jen,2,B+,ANTH222,"I get the impression Dr. Schaffer is trying to be relatable, hip, and cool -- she curses in lecture, jokes about sex, etc. -- in reality this often makes lecture incredibly awkward.  I don't mind ""cool"" instructors, but Schaffer tries so hard it's uncomfortable.

Lecture style aside (it's bearable, but annoying), there were other problems with the course:  the weekly quizzes often expected outright wrong answers, the labs had vague questions or questions that didn't reflect the materials we were given, TAs didn't have enough time to prepare for the labs, we were issued the wrong book, and lectures disagreed with the book.

The most difficult parts of the course were when I was struggling against Dr. Schaffer's course design, not when I was struggling to remember the material.  ",1824
shaffer_l_jen,5,A+,ANTH266,"I just finished a semester with Dr. Shaffer and honestly she was one of the nicest professors that I have had at umd. Her class weighs heavily on discussions which for a subject such as climate change, it should have more of a discussion based lecture. She is very passionate about her work and is very welcoming when going to office hours. As long as you put in effort in her class you should get a good grade.",1824
abbasi,4,B,ECON200,"I thought Abbasi was a good professor. Not great, but also not bad. Most of the students in my 300-person lecture could care less and only came because we had participation points (clicker stuff). I did pretty well in the class, but the average grade was around 80%. He explained things clearly with emphasis, but sometimes you tone out to his voice. ",1827
abbasi,4,A-,ECON200,Totally fine. Had clickers (which you could do from your phone put I think they would be more difficult if you weren't in class). First exam had some grammatical errors but late midterms were fine. Lecturing covered what it needed with appropriate emphasis according to the importance of the topic. Solid choice for professor (just don't disrupt class).,1827
abbasi,2,B-,ECON200,"our class was not the biggest fan of him. personally i hate large lecture classes but if you like economics take this. if youre looking for a gen-ed to fill, do not take this, i made that mistake and wish someone had told me earlier",1827
abbasi,5,A-,ECON200,"I found professor Abbasi to be very good. What was helpful is him posting all of the lecture notes, so if you miss something in class you can easily go back and take notes. He also posts practice exams which reflect the level of difficulty that you will face on the actual exam which is helpful. I think the exams were fair, but you have to put in a good amount of work to get an A in the class. Abbasi is approachable so you can easily reach out to him in person after class or during his office hours, or simply email him with any questions or concerns.",1827
abbasi,4,B+,ECON200,He handled online classes really well and was a very good lecturer. Boring at times but very accessible and accommodating.,1827
abbasi,4,B,ECON200,He’s a really good lecturer. Workload is kinda heavy but exams aren’t awful,1827
abbasi,5,A,ECON200,"I found professor Abassi to be a very good teacher. His lectures are clear and relatable. His tests are fair. I think the best way to do well in his class is to review the homeworks, attend the GSS study sessions and office hours if you have any questions, and read the textbook, and study hard and econ could be a very interesting class. the material is very valuable and helps you think about the world in a more practical light. it is very conceptual and not a lot of math. there are normally two chapters a week to read which can take an hour each at least because of the questions afterwards which are easy but a lot. the grade is counted for completion but the homework is counted for correctness.. Overall, the professor is there to help his students success and wants them to do well.",1827
gimpel,2,A-,,"He is a really nice guy, just not the best teacher... He had slides that he used and just looked at them the whole time, barely looked at or interacted with the class.  Sometimes he wrote on the white board..?  Again, he's a really nice guy, its just hard to get involved with the class.  One time he started an actual discussion that got the students involved, and it was actually pretty interesting debate/talk, but it only happened one time.  Take the class if you are good with ArcMap or want to work with that (that's the lab portion taught by the TA and basically all the grade is based on), but not if you're looking for a super interesting discussion/lecture class.",1829
gimpel,1,A,,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH GIMPEL.
I am sure he would be a good professor in a qualitative class where all that needs to be done is lecture, but gvpt227 is a qualitative class based on statistics and he is not the right teacher for this. He gets off topic when giving examples, the lectures are not relevant to the exams, and although a formula and numbers are given I have NO IDEA what the relevance of the numbers is to analyzing the data. But in this class that is fine, application is not tested at all. He lectures with his head facing down towards the projector and focused on what he is saying, so even when there is a question he has no idea. Its a pretty awful class. I'm sure the grades will be fine but if you do not have to take this class for a gov requirement DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH GIMPEL.",1829
gimpel,4,A,GVPT423,"Good class, good teacher.  Lecture was engaging and enjoyable.  A lot of readings, but they weren't difficult to understand.  Tests were fairly straight forward and if you came to class, or at least did readings, nothing suprised you.  Homeworks were ok, but more work than expected.  He seems to think that writing 5 or 6 or 7 pages, due the very next week he assigns them is normal.  But we only had 4 or 5 a whole semester.  ",1829
gimpel,4,,GVPT423H,Dr. Gimpel was a great professor! You could tell he genuinely cared about students and tried his best to make the class as interesting as possible. I would take him again! I would suggest anyone who takes this class should do the readings and look at the homeworks in advance since they are five-page papers.,1829
novick,5,A+,HESP214,"Dr. Novick is absolutely the best. He is super clear in his lectures and made the class super easy to understand even if you have little to no science background (I'm a business major). I loved this class, it was an easy class that got me thinking differently than the rest of my core classes! ",1833
novick,5,A+,HESP214,Amazing professor! Truly cares about his student's success. I took this course while it was online and it took up maybe 1-2 hours max a week. So worth it!!,1833
novick,5,A,HONR279Y,"Took this course last year and loved it. Novick gets to know each student and cares for them. Lectures were always easygoing and fun. You get what you put in, so he expects you to do the readings and think critically. Super supportive, you don't have to be a language science major to learn a lot from him.",1833
wessel,5,,PSYC221,She didn't require a textbook for the class and taught concepts very well. Her teaching was really thorough and easy to understand. Her exams are easy and for psyc221 it was exactly based on her guided lecture notes. She drops one grade per category including exams. I'd say she is an excellent professor.,1838
wessel,5,A-,PSYC221,"An amazing professor, definitely one of my favorites at UMD. She explains concepts in a very understandable way and is very approachable if you have questions. She does a great job at facilitating conversations in lecture and discussion. Her exams are very straightforward and if you study her guided lecture notes and do the practice problems provided, it's hard not to get a good grade.",1838
herberholz,5,B+,PSYC406,"I really liked Dr. Herberholz. First of all, his accent is awesome (and I think he's hot, but that's me).  Second, you can practically see passionate fire in his eyes and he has a hard time keeping still when we get on an interesting topic. And third, he's just a really good teacher.  Instead of standing there and reading slides while we silently take notes, he asks a lot of questions. Now, I'll be the first to admit, that can be a pain in the ass and not a lot of professors can pull it off, but with Dr. Herberholz it wasn't uncomfortable. He'll always ask for new ideas, future points to think about, criticism of current research, etc. It makes you feel more involved in the learning, trust me. 

As for the class itself, the material was usually okay. Nothing too hard or complicated as long as you take the time to read through it. Unfortunately, he doesn't post his slides online (bring a computer, my notes from each class were always at least 4 TYPED pages in Word, hand cramps!), but he stresses that he won't test you on anything that you can't find in the textbook (and a lot of his graphs and graphics are from there too). His midterms were 15 true/false, do 10, and 15 short answer, do 10; final was 20 of each, do 15.  I really liked that, because I could pick the questions I felt I really understood and could give the best answer for.

There's also a paper, a ""grant proposal""  proposing new research using one of the animal models we studied (bat, owl, toad, crayfish, aplysia, drosophila, rat) and a combination of behavioral and neuroscience techniques.  I was super nervous about that because he's a bit of a strict grader on his exams, but we all ended up getting a 92.5% as long as the paper had all the parts and was handed in on time.",1839
herberholz,4,A-,,"Dr. Herberholz teaches straight from powerpoints.  His tests are always the same format - 15 true/false (you choose 10 to actually do) and 15 short answer (again, you only have to do 10).  Studying the book is helpful, but you can definitely get an A if you know the powerpoint information well enough.  Attendance not required, but he does not use blackboard so unless you have a friend in the class, you can't get the notes.  Very interesting class if you're interested in animal behavior.",1839
birnir,1,,GVPT100,"She is not a good professor. The course is not a good course. The whole thing is a hell of a problem. Because of this course, I wasn't able to graduate and my life is in ruins. Now I'm in debt and no degree. The course is statistics, not politics. If you don't get a good grade, you will be kicked out of the major. I finished all my coursework for the degree except this one, but now I'm broke and I can't take it for a third time and I'm considering claiming bankruptcy or going off the grid. All because of this class and how hard she takes it. She has ruined my life. ",1842
birnir,3,B,GVPT100,"This class is so confusing. I don't even know why it related to government. The graphs are labeled with government terms but besides that it is purely a statistics course...which sucked. 
There was no problem with Birnir but I had a difficult time in the class understanding how to use the software and understanding it. 
My suggestion is to get along with the TA and they can help you out. ",1842
birnir,4,A,GVPT100,"This GVPT 100 class is an easy A, as long as you have the right TA.  My friend received 100% on the second midterm without showing up to 8 weeks of lecture after a study session with my TA.  The final paper is a pain, mostly because it's like nothing you've ever done before and it is very open-ended.  Birnir herself is very nice, and attempts to be engaging, but her subject is often boring so I showed up to about half the lectures.",1842
birnir,2,A,GVPT100,This class was so boring.  I have taken STAT 100 and this GVPT (stat based) class was awful.  Professor Birnir didn't explain the material well. She focused mainly on her own studies and projects.  The lectures were useless and my TA admitted to my section that she grades us harshly because she thinks we didn't like her.  I didn't learn anything in this class. ,1842
birnir,3,A,GVPT100,"This class is on statistics. It's all statistics. I didn't learn anything about government other than the statistics with research study. You'll get an A if you study, because the test are to the point, but it is a statistics class.",1842
birnir,5,,GVPT100,"It's upsetting that Birnir gets such a bad wrap for teaching GVPT100. The decision to make 100 a statistics based class is ultimately upon the department. Their rationale is that graduate work in government is heavily based in statistics, so undergrads need better training in that area. She's a great teacher and a very nice person. Don't hate the player hate the game. ",1842
birnir,5,A,,"Johanna was super nice and cool. What a lot of people don't understand is that GVPT is all about statistics and that is what GVPT100 is supposed to be about but they turned it into some useless theory class that you won't ever apply. Stat is 100% necessary for any government major and as a senior who hasn't learned it, I wish I had someone like Johanna who cared enough and enough foresight to teach it.",1842
birnir,1,C,GVPT100,"NEVER TAKE BIRNIR IF YOU ARE GOV MAJOR OR JUST LOOKING FOR AN EASY CORE. THIS CLASS IS RIDICULOUS AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT. 

we did graduate level work, there was no need for this class for the major. take KOULISH if you can. ",1842
birnir,1,B,GVPT100,"WARNING: THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT CLASS!!!

We did not learn a single thing about american government, at all.  Instead we learned how to analyze political data by running various tests and comparisons.  When we should have been learning about Hobbes and Locke, we were learning how to calculate standard deviation of z-scores, how to identify skewness, and the difference between nominal, ordinal, and interval variables (this we not even the half of it).  My suggestion to everyone, do not take this class unless you are interested in this form a politics or you have no other choice.  

If you do end up taking this class, here is what to expect:
Very boring and uninteresting lectures, she tends to ramble a lot!  2 mid-terms, a final, a 10 page final paper, and at least 2 hours of homework every week.  The homework uses the statistical analysis software, SPSS, which requires you to use a computer lab on campus or purchase the software yourself for about $90.00+.  You will be running various statistical tests on a given set of data.  It is very tedious, takes forever to do because you CAN NOT SKIM, and the homework is graded answer for answer, not just for completion.  

If you are lucky like me and get a really good/understanding TA, this class will not be as rough for you because the T.A's are in charge of ALL the grading for their section.  If not, then be prepared to work harder than the rest of the class.

Professor Birnir is very knowledgeable in this area of politics she just is not knowledgeable at all on how to convey this information to the class.  So basically, you are on your own. ",1842
birnir,1,A,GVPT100,So much statistics. No actual government.,1842
birnir,1,C,GVPT100,"Birnir takes a completely different approach to GVPT100.  Our class considers ourselves the ""rogue"" government course due to the amount of statistics we do.  Yes, I said STATISTICS!  We have yet to learn about a single governmental system and rarely use the word democracy in the class.  The most frequented words are mean, median, and mode.  Please do not take this course unless you enjoy statistics.  And God help you if you have no other option...",1842
birnir,4,A-,GVPT201,"Johanna is a wonderful lady and knows her stuff, but the course really sucked. It's half statistics half coding in R. You have to really enjoy that type of thing to enjoy the class. I figure taking it at the undergrad level also helps gov majors figure out if they'd wanna go into political science ",1842
birnir,4,,GVPT201,"Not the hardest class in the world but it's certainly challenging especially if you don't know coding. I had to go to office hours every week to get help on the weekly coding assignments. I could not have gotten through this class without my TA. They're also time consuming so manage your time. If you do that, you can make the class less overwhelming. Unless you're a GVPT major or are good at coding, I wouldn't recommend this class just because of how time consuming and complicated it can be. ",1842
wallis,5,A,ECON311,"Professor Wallis is a very knowledgeable individual. The course is an interesting one. It is important you do well on the exams because there is no extra credit and only two online assignments. As most have said, 80% and above gets you an A. However, because the test are mostly essay based, this is not an easy A. Make sure you know the review sheet (you may be asked questions that are not on the review sheet so be prepared). No math involved and you don't need the book to pass. ",1845
wallis,5,A,ECON311,"One of my favorite lecturers at UMD and definitely the most interesting and relevant ECON lecturer I've had. I wish UMD offered more ECON history courses. In this class, there are two online quizzes, two midterms, and the final, so not much work outside of class. He puts the slides online, but I highly recommend coming to class. It isn't necessary to do the readings - usually his explanation makes more sense - but it helps to do the important ones, like Callender and Bailyn. All exams are written or mostly written. An 80 percent is an A.",1845
wallis,5,A,ECON311,"One of the best professors I've had. I looked forward to going to his lectures, and they were interesting enough that I was rarely distracted.

Like everyone else said, he's really opinionated but that just manifests itself through him relating the concepts of the course to relevant current affairs. When we got to talking about ""the pitfalls of democracy"" he referenced Trump a lot, things like that.

Lectures are super interesting and I'd say mandatory if you want to get a decent grade in the class. I missed a grand total of 2 lectures over the semester and wound up with an A overall. Other than attending lecture and studying for 1-2 days before each exam, there's no other major work you have to do in the class. 90% of your class grade is determined by the midterms and final.",1845
wallis,4,C,ECON311,"One of my favorite professors at Maryland. Nobody knows more about the economy before the Civil War than he does. Tests are essay and impossible to BS because he is very picky about what he expects you to say. 80 is an A, 50 is a C,and somewhere around 65 is a B. Only thing I don't like is he doesn't use the +/- system so if you get a 63 like me you are shit out of luck ",1845
wallis,3,B,ECON311,"Very strong minded but pretty cool. The material is interesting but somewhat borderline interesting. I haven't read a single page of the textbook and went to lectures got B on my first exam, A on my second. Just know every single material on the review sheet and you should be golden. But remember to be extra specific.. He grades tough but 80% is an A, 65% is a B and so on.. so Not impossible to get a high grade. I haven't been to his office hours but I heard he's pretty cool to talk to about grades. ",1845
wallis,2,D,ECON312,"He's very boring. Some topics are interesting but he talks about mostly history not really the econ side to things. He loves talking about the railroads. I never read the books which is probably why I barely passed. I would not recommend this class. 

He loves giving pop quizzes and hates when people leave after them. His exams are all essay which you think they'd be easy to BS but no...he looks for specific things and if you don't got them you do poorly on them",1845
wallis,4,B,ECON312,"Wallis is a pretty cool guy. He's an old school, tells-it-like-it-is kind of a professor, and his class was spent mostly with him lecturing. However, he had a knack for keeping you interested in lecture, and attending class never felt like a chore. He gives 6 pop quizzes throughout the semester and counts your top 4, so attending class is a must. In addition, the class had one midterm and one final, so a combination of reading the book and his notes is important to do well. 

Overall Wallis is a down to earth guy and if you pay attention and put in an consistent effort, there's no reason you can't get at least a B. ",1845
wallis,5,A,ECON311,"Professor Wallis is an excellent professor. He's hugely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject and this translates into very interesting lectures. It's awesome to be talking about economic history and then relate that to plate tectonics.

Overall, the class isn't hard as long as you go to class and take notes. If you do this you will get an A. Reading the textbook is pretty optional.

He's also got a pretty cool grading scheme where if you get 80% of all possible points in the class you get an A and if you get 50% of all possible points you get a C.",1845
wallis,5,,ECON412,"I really like Dr. Wallis's teaching style, which rarely consists of him reading from a slide or writing on the board, but rather is oral and story like.

He seems really knowledgeable about anything even slightly related to the course topic and makes class interesting.  He's not afraid to tell a joke or two. Very glad I took him.",1845
wallis,4,A,ECON311,"The class is not nearly as hard as people would have you believe. To do well all you have to do is read over his notes a few times before you expect to have a quiz or before the midterms/final. Like everyone says an 80 is an A and just by reading his notes you can get 100s on all quizzes and near perfect scores on the exams. As a human being he is definitely a jerk to put it lightly, but he really knows the subject and you do actually learn a lot.",1845
wallis,5,A,ECON311,"Wallis is a great lecturer. If you don't like the math aspects of econ, this class is for you. It's basically a history class and if you can follow the story of what's happening, you will do well. If you want a class that you don't have to go to lecture and can just read the book, then don't take this class. If you GO TO LECTURE and actually bother to LISTEN and TAKE NOTES, the exams and quizzes are fairly easy. The exams are based on the lectures, so reading the book is good really just for reinforcement. Do the review sheets and go through the notes- yours and his slides he posts online, and you'll be good. Make sure to answer each part of the questions he asks for the essays. An 80 is an A, which is nice. ",1845
wallis,4,,ECON311,"Wallis is one of the craziest econ professor here with the biggest ego ever. His unneccessary jokes/comments are what is keeping me awake in lectures. There are popquiz in lectures, do the review sheets and 2 midterms/1 final--all essays and MCs. Its not as easy as it looks, just be sure to answer the questions that he is asking. The fixed curve for this class is 80% is an A. ",1845
wallis,2,B,ECON311,"The biggest thing I hate about professors is ther negative attitues and judgemental behavior. He takes it to a whole new level. Every other word that comes out of his mouth is a jon (like in jonning), for people that dont get that word, he is constantly dissing a certain orientation, from Chinese Asians, to African American, to practically everyone except himself. Constantly being a Predujuce bigot. I don't want to even give you examples of what he had said in class. It made me extremely unconfortable and discusted. But probably people would take his course because there is a set curve of B being an A. Which becomes irrelevant because he never gave out A's. But 'he sucked' and was extremely rude.",1845
wallis,3,B,ECON311,"Right off the bat, a 50 is a C in this class and an 80 is an A. That being said, the ONLY grades in this class are 2 online quizzes and 2 in-class essay tests. The tests are super subjective to grading, and you basically lose/gain points pretty randomly. The lectures are little bit boring, as Wallis usually just reads right off the slides. ",1845
wallis,4,B,ECON311,"Super easy class, but only take if you like essays. He doesn't do plus minus grading and there is a huge curve. It's easy to get a B but harder to get an A.",1845
wallis,4,B,ECON311,"Very interesting class, but its extremely hard to get an A unless you take extensive notes and read every article. He is a little old school and his powerpoints are too cumbersome. The exams are essay-based so just understand the frameworks of each article and you should be fine. ",1845
mohr,4,,PSYC200,"Coming into class while already having taken a stats class will make the first part of the material very easy. 
All tests are open book, including the final. Homework assignments will help your grade have a little boost. 
Lab is annoying, but you have to go to turn in homework.
Unfortunately this class was so early (8am) and boring. He tries to make it funny, but honestly there's no fixing that the class gets dead boring, and often too. 
But he's a really nice professor, and answers all your questions. 

One issue are the tests. It's not necessarily 'hard' but  he is very picky about answers. To make sure you don't get points off you must write everything and anything. and I don't just mean showing work, you have to say why you are doing what you are doing. Printing PP slides is so helpful for tests. ",1846
mohr,5,,PSYC200,"Dr. Mohr is an excellent professor. He was fair, responded promptly to emails and tried to make the class interesting. He posts his lectures online which was really helpful when it came to studying for tests. There's a homework assignment each week, which isn't hard but usually it can take 3-4 hours. But don't worry about that, because as long as you attempt the homework, you will receive full credit. The exams are open notes. I definitely recommend Mohr to others.",1846
mohr,5,A,PSYC200,"I want to tell you that I'm not done taking this course. However I've completed around 70% of it and can tell you that overall he's a very chill man and overall likes his subject. 
His grading scheme is out of 200 points overall with 2 tests + final + hwk + a paper, 186+ = A. He also has ~4 extra credit points and if you've taken stat100/math111 you'll find most of the material pretty manageable. 
TL;DR take him, he'll make Psyc200 easier for you. Oh and he's pretty flamboyant.. So he's pretty lively and what not.",1846
ortiz_jose,5,A,HESP120,Great professor. Exams are exactly what is on the slides. He works well with you if you need to reschedule any exams. He also gives extra credit if needed. Goes a bit quickly through the slides but posts them after class.,1848

Her lectures include info not in the textbook that are on the exam, but she also gives tips for the exams. There are only 3 exams and then, there is discussion. I recommend reading the book for her class and going to lecture. This course is not intensive. She brings in guest speakers and they share their experiences on the job... and then, she puts questions about the guest speaker on the exam. The exams are straightforward. Some of her lectures bore me, while most keep focused because they are so interesting. She tells her personal experiences that relate to the topic, which keeps me engaged in lecture.",1853

Regardless of it you agree with him, he is a great teacher and has experience with constitution making. He really likes to move through lectures and expects you to do the readings. They are really interesting and are easy to follow so if you can manage those you are in the clear for the entire class. I seemed to be one of the few who read them or participated in class. I think he became annoyed with me that I answered most of the in class questions, but oh well. He leaves the work and how you want to do it completely up to you. So if you are a student that likes everything laid out for you for papers, etc. do not take his courses. However, he basically feeds you the midterm questions and final questions. So all you have to do for the class is literally read the assignments and write a paper on basically anything at the end of the semester. Interesting topic, motivated teacher, class worth taking. ",1856
soltan,3,A,,"Great, interesting, very friendly guy, but not the greatest lecturer. The material he presents is incredibly broad and abstract, and I often had trouble getting a grasp on it. Someone in my class made a Google Doc before each exam and they helped a lot. Make sure you understand Game Theory, and USE THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES HE PROVIDES YOU WITH in your essays (e.g. mention ""the old lady from Sarajevo""-you'll know what I'm talking about when you take the course). ",1856
soltan,4,A-,,"I love this guy.  He is genuinely interested in his students, has a great knowledge base, and has brilliant conversations.  If anything, that is his greatest flaw.  He teaches his class like a brilliant conversations, which can sometimes be tough to follow in the format of an introductory lecture.",1856
soltan,3,A,,"I didn't love his teaching style. His lectures were hard to follow, and I often took less than half a page of notes per class. However, his grading system makes the class easy to get an A or B in, so if you have to take this class and aren't a gov major, he isn't too bad.",1856
soltan,5,A,GVPT100,"I really liked Professor Soltan's class! He made GVPT100 very easy to understand, and my TA was great too.",1856
soltan,4,,GVPT100,"Professor Soltan is a good guy and can be entertaining at times. You don't need to go to lecture; the things he says don't follow in a clear train of thought, so it's almost impossible to take notes. He puts his own notes up before each exam and if you look at them, you'll do well. I had a good TA who made it unnecessary for me to read most of the readings, but you can do that at your own discretion. There is a generous curve and it overall is a good class.",1856
soltan,1,,GVPT100,"Unless you are interested in the philosophical side of government, DO NOT take this class.  Lectures with Professor Soltan are unbearable.  While Soltan is very well educated and often funny man, he is unable to covey his ideas in an efficient manner. It’s almost impossible to follow his train of thought and translate it into coherent notes. Most times, I walked away from lecture with more questions than answers and a TON of readings. Discussions did not help much either. While I cannot speak for the other TAs, my TA struggled to communicate his ideas. In addition, the grading was extremely unclear and sometimes harsh. Grades were only given for exams and participation in discussion.  Even though we got our exams back once they were graded, I could never understand the comments given or the pattern of grading.  Also, the levels required to receive an A seemed impossible at best.  It often felt like they were just looking for trivial bits in essays to mark you off for. Finally, the professor was extremely disorganized. He refused to use blackboard to post grades and made you reach his syllabus by Googling it.  There is no doubt that Soltan is a genius when it comes to this subject, but he struggles to teach the material.  As a student who was interested in the actual workings of government verses the philosophical workings of government, I was very disappointed with this chore of a class.",1856
soltan,2,B,,"To be honest I hated this class.  But to be fair I think it was only because I took it to fulfill both honors and core and don't actually have much of an interest in gvpt.  There are a lot of long, tedious readings that I didn't care to do.  Classes are very unstructured and I usually left asking myself what in the world I was supposed to have learned from them.  If you can manage not to zone off (he's got a lovely accent that tended to be more meditative than engaging) and take notes, the class is probably not too difficult.  But I would recommend that if you are not majoring in gvpt, have limited interest in gvpt, or very little background in the area, just stick to the regular version and get your honors credit elsewhere.  It'll save you and the teacher a semester-long headache.",1856
soltan,4,,GVPT459H,"Dr. Soltan was a great professor this semester! I really enjoyed learning about the cases with him and I appreciated how much he had to say about each topic. It was clear he was very knowledgeable about the topics we learned. It was difficult to understand some of the harder topics in the course, so it was hard to know what he was looking for in the exams, but otherwise, I loved this course! Having never had a background in law, it was interesting learning about some of these topics.",1856
skinker,5,A,HESP202,"Kate is excellent. She's a great lecturer. She's funny, experienced, and such a sweet person.
If you get above a 90, she gives you an A, not an A-.  
The class was a good taste of hearing and speech sciences, while not being too much work.
There was one paper, it was short and easy. You watch a movie for it.
",1859
skinker,5,A+,HESP202,"Kate is a fantastic professor. She has been in the profession for years, so she knows what she's talking about. She has a lot of examples of all of the different disorders we learned about, which really helped me understand everything she was talking about. I would recommend going to lecture, but missing one or two is fine, you can get notes from a friend. If you do have to miss lecture, I'd recommend reading the corresponding text. All of her lectures come directly from the book, so just study lecture notes when studying for tests. Basically if you show up to class you'll do fine. Definitely a good class and one of my favorite professors.",1859
skinker,3,B,HESP202,"This class wasn't as easy I anticipated. I had heard that it was an easy A. 

There aren't many graded assignments. Fall 2011 there were 5 quizzes (1 dropped), 2 tests, and a non cumulative final. Plus we were required to do experimental participation. That was easy though. 

The quizzes are multiple choice based entirely off the reading, which is in the book. She announces a few days before each quiz when it will be and what it will be on. And although she says that she chooses the biggest points and if you read you shouldn't have a problem on the quizzes, I always read for the quizzes and still failed 2 of the 4 we've had thus far. 

The material isn't very hard, but you do have to study to remember it all. Because there aren't many graded assignments one bad grade can really bring you down. 

I really liked Kate and the class was really interesting, I just wish I had been more on top of it from the beginning. It can be an easy class if you stay on top of the material. ",1859
skinker,5,A,HESP202,"Good professor, cares about how students perform in the class. Tests are not too bad as long as you study. I recommend using a laptop because you need to take a lot of notes. 
For all the lazy people that don't go to class, they do not get as good grades. ",1859
skinker,5,A,HESP202,"Required to go to lecture, but if you miss one you can copy notes from someone or meet with the TAs. Slides are self-explanatory, but professor adds things in class that helped me remember the information (examples, videos, demonstrations). 
Dropped one quiz, gave extra credit to those who were there the day before Thanksgiving, gave extra credit if over 95% of class filled out course evaluation, extra credit to 10 people in the hearing section if you get to the front of the class first.
Exams are multiple choice, true/false, matching, and fill-in the blank. I thought the first exam would be easier--need to know the information well and memorize what terms belong in which category to get an A. After first exam you can figure out how to study for her exams. Final was not cumulative. ",1859
skinker,4,A,HESP202,"This class was very interesting. Kate is so knowledgable about the subject.
There's not too much to your grade- 5 quizzes, 1 two page paper, and 3 non cumulative exams.  You do have to go to lecture becuase she never posts slides on elms, and tests are almost 100% based off of lecture notes.  The class is quite time consuming, but isn't bad compared to many other electives.
I did learn a lot too.",1859
skinker,3,,HESP202,"I didn't really like this class- you really have to pay attention all the time in order to do well. I'm not a bad student, but I don't have that many hours to devote to this one class. ",1859
skinker,5,A,HESP202,"I loved Kate. Her voice is not bad at all and she's perfectly intelligible. Her tests are straight from the powerpoints, but she doesn't post them online so you have to go to class. There's one two page paper which was a review on a movie with a person with a developmental disorder (I watched I Am Sam). There are 2 experiential requirements. She gives quizzes but tells you in class and emails you exactly when they are and exactly what you need to read (which isn't much) to pass them. I took this class as an elective but loved it so much I'm thinking about majoring in hearing and speech. ",1859
skinker,4,A-,HESP202,Her voice drove me out of my mind and the class was early so I basically never went. All of the quizzes are 5 questions mult. choice but she tells you when they are. Tests are straight from the notes so all you need to do is copy someones notes and your fine. This class is easy but if you take it too easy you can get screwed.,1859
skinker,5,AB,HESP202,"Kate is a great teacher.  She is really animated and keeps you on your toes.  She wants you to do well, and proves it by throwing out questions on tests that too many people get wrong.  Really interesting class (HESP202) and she's a great person to take it with",1859
skinker,5,A,HESP202,"Kate is a great professor. Show up to class, do the readings and the quizzes, and you can't get less than a B. Sometimes the material is a little dry but she does her best to make it interesting. Sitting in the front is worth it because she will recognize you.  
Several quizzes (5?), 2 exams + non cumulative final, easy and quick project summarizing child language development. ",1859
skinker,2,B+,HESP202,"Kind of annoying, and not as accommodating as she tries to make herself seem. Has high expectations for students, and is not understanding when students cannot meet them.",1859
skinker,3,A,HESP202,"Ridiculously easy, stopped attending class in the first month and just watched the recorded lectures on 2x a couple days before exams and got an A. Pretty interesting information but lectures were boring.",1859
skinker,5,A+,HESP202,This class was ridiculously easy. If you show up to class and pay attention you literally cannot get below a 90%. Kate is super quirky and nice and tlaking to her always brightened my day. TBH i loved her and can't wait to take another class of hers,1859
skinker,3,A,HESP400,"Kate is always all over the place, but being online makes it worse. The lectures were discombobulated, but everything is relatively easy and straightforward except for the final project. I felt unprepared to do such a large and time consuming final project since there were few assignments due before this and the feedback was not helpful. No need to buy the textbook, she posted all the sections you need. ",1859
yearwood,1,,GEOG201,"Really bad teacher. Confuses the hello out of you. The whole class is only exams. So if you do bad on one exam, you are done for the whole semester",1861
yearwood,5,,GEOG201,"The class is easy but he is the worst professor possible. Really hated how he taught the class. Exams questions are so confusing. Multiple choice questions will have more than one choice, and because of this a lot of people fail the exams. He makes a lot of mistakes when he grades the exams. ",1861
yearwood,2,C+,GEOG201,Boring professor. Will test you on little details that he barely covers in class. Class is not organized ,1861
yearwood,2,,GEOG201,"There were only three exams and several online assignments. The online assignments were spaced out oddly, as sometimes we would have 2-3 quizzes due on Monday and Wednesday and other weeks we wouldn't have anything due. This threw me off quite often: he doesn't give late credit so if you miss one assignment, you get a zero and it will hurt your grade a ton.

I also didn't like how he taught the course. The lectures would be anywhere from 60-300+ slides long, with some pictures and walls of text. It almost looked as if he copied and pasted information from an essay or a textbook and put them in bullet points. Usually, professors try to cover the important information - not every little tiny tiny detail. A 300+ slide long lecture is way too long.

The textbook is useless and I would advise to not waste your money on it. You will still have to buy an access code for the online exercises. 

His exam reviews were helpful and fair. Most of the information in the exam reviews wound up being on the exams, although he occasionally put bizarre questions on the exams anyways.

Also as a warning, it seems that Dr. Yearwood didn't know how to enter grade weights into ELMS, meaning that people's grades appeared to be inflated for the entire semester. He had several months to fix this issue and kept refusing to fix the grade weights (or does not know how to), as he kept telling students to just calculate the grades themselves. I admit that I should've noticed earlier, but considering that all my other professors always enter the grade weights correctly at the beginning of the year, I wrongly assumed that he would do the same.",1861
yearwood,2,C,GEOG201,"Please avoid him at ALL COST!!! There are only 3 exams that account for 85% of your total grade (the rest are from reading assignments online) and if you screw one up, you are doomed. The material itself is really not that hard, but his exams are extremely confusing because of the way he worded certain questions and answer. 
Definitely study his study guide before the exams AND the details about the topics he specifically mentioned because they will show up on them for sure.
Also, go to his lectures because he gives out questions he might ask on the exams or answers to specific questions. Although he sometimes complains about students' absences and/or how easy and straightforward his exams are(which is not true), just hang on there.
Just a final note, sit closer to the front on the day of exams so you can get the test paper earlier (He hands them out ONE BY ONE and still missed some of us...)",1861
yearwood,5,A,GEOG140,great teacher to have,1861

yearwood,1,C+,GEOG140,"Do NOT take a class with this professor. Not sure about in-person classes with him, but online was an absolute nightmare. No matter how much studying you do, you won't get full points on exams. Then, students complained to him and he got angry and sent passive-aggressive announcements to us saying that none of us study or retain any info from the slides. (He also added that regardless of the pandemic, we all have to cope, so that felt like a ""basically, get over it"") We complained to department heads about his grading and stuff and they said it was taken care of... but did my grade change? no. 
I am in my 3rd year of college. I have had many iffy professors, but nothing like this guy. I wish him the best, but please do not take his class.",1861
rothman,4,A,HONR238D,"Rothman is a really nice professor and the class is interesting. The musicals and work she gives aren't time consuming, but it can get a little repetitive to always be watching musicals and reading 5 pages about said musical. The thing I dislike most is how harshly she grades; this is an honors course, so you would expect it, but she takes off a LOT on essays without having given you a rubric to guide you through the writing process. There aren't very many assignments, however, which is a plus. I would recommend this class if you're a strong writer, but still be wary even if you think you're amazing. I was used to As on papers and got a B on the very first paper I wrote for this class since she grades like an English teacher.",1866
rothman,5,,THET110,"Dr. Rothman is very engaging. Although I only took this class for the GenEd, I ended up sort of liking theatre... and I am a chemistry major. I am actually really embarassed that I got an A- in this class because it was so simple. The first half of the course, in my opinion was more fun. We learned about what theatre was. The second half, however, was extremely boring and dense. She talked about the history of theatre, which was EXTREMELY boring and dense. So due to that, my grade dropped from an A+ to an A-. Then again, I procrastinated a lot too during the second half of the semester. Anyways, I recommend taking Dr. Rothman. She's great! ",1866
rothman,5,A,,"Dr. Rothman was a very engaging professor. She obviously knew a lot about theatre and had a lot of connections in the DC theatre world, so we got to meet and hear from several theatre professionals over the course of the semester. The seminar was much more involved than most of my other classes--there were field trips, almost weekly quizzes, and group projects--but most honors seminars are pretty involved, and the trips were pretty fun. There's a lot of participation in the class, but Dr. Rothman encourages everyone to talk and is very open to all different points of view. If you have time and some interest in theatre, I would definitely recommend her theatre classes.",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"It's a really great class. It's a decent amount of work, but the information is easy to understand and it's fun. I actually became a Theatre major after taking this class because it was so great.",1866

rothman,3,A,THET110,"Dr. Rothman is a good teacher and she makes Theater as interesting as possible for someone that doesn't particularly love theatre. But she isn't very involved in how you do in this class, rather, it's all about your TA. Some of the TAs are good but some can make your life hard.

The course is not as easy as it seems and is actually frustrating. There are 2 exams, 2 papers about plays you have to see, 1 group performance (where you memorize lines and do costumes), and weekly quizzes. There are also various extra credit opportunities.

I took this course to fulfill a humanities credit and it was pretty frustrating overall. The performance was a lot of work and the papers were annoying. Not a hard course, but definitely not easy.",1866
rothman,4,A-,THET110,"Prof Rothman is an awesome professor. She is hilarious and always keeps the class interested. This semester she made Thet110 much harder than it should be.
Awesome prof but class is much harder than it should be",1866
rothman,4,A,THET110,"If you need to wipe out an arts requirement, THET110 with Rothman will probably do the job.

Rothman herself makes lecture interesting enough but a good amount of the material is kind of bland. You'll constantly wonder when you can finally get to the kind of 20th century theater that made you take the class in the first place (hint: it's not until the last week of class).

Expect weekly quizzes in discussion that are manageable but annoying nonetheless. Throw in a couple quizzes in lecture at the end of the semester for good measure (read whatever needs to be read and you'll probably be fine). 

She gives lots of extra credit and the exams are pretty easy if you show up to class and take anything vaguely resembling notes. Old exams are similar to the current exams so finding someone who took the class prior or checking out Koofers will probably help.

A little more work than I'd like for getting rid of an art requirement but it's easy nonetheless. ",1866
rothman,1,B,,"So long as you do nothing but agree with her all the time and have no opinion, you'll pass. It seems the only way to get an A is if she likes you and she will definitely make it obvious who she does and does not like. Extremely time consuming and definitely not worth taking.",1866
rothman,1,A,HONR238D,"Okay, seriously, I made an OurUMD account just so that I could rant about Rothman. That's how much I disliked her. The class itself is interesting if, like me, you enjoy musical theatre. You can do other homework or something during the mandatory movies she makes you watch, so its not too much of a waste of time, and most of them are pretty good. The thing that I hated in this class was that you were forced to agree with her all the time in class. Protip: She loves Stephen Sondheim so much that she would go straight for him (too bad he's gay!). So if you happen to like something that she hates she will rip your response apart. Just trust me, agree with everything that crazy woman says. The only way to get out of class is to have a signed note from the health center or your doctor. Any other reason is inexcusable. And don't even think about leaving early or arriving late, even for a legitimate reason. She will take off all your participation for the day.

My advice is to just try to speak once to twice a class period, never have an original opinion and have an extremely open mind. You will watch the most God-awful musical ever about this gay transsexual he/she trying to escape Berlin. It is ALARMING. Just be prepared. I got an A because I can write well and I know how to keep my mouth shut about my opinions. Good luck.",1866
rothman,5,A,HONR238D,"Dr. Rothman wants you to engage in the material and be involved in class. However, you should only take this class if you enjoy musical theater already, or want to enjoy musical theater. It's not a class that requires much thinking, as all of your homework assignments are to watch musicals and read articles, but this can take between 2-5 hours a week, depending on how many musicals are assigned. I think the grade distribution (93% A) is a bit misleading, as no one slacked off and didn't put a significant amount of time and effort into the class. That being said, I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who intends to watch musicals. ",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"She is pretty cool and quirky. There is a lot of material in this course but it's not too bad if you study a little bit before the exams.

However, to be honest, I personally didn't like the class. Make sure that if you're signing up for HONR238D that you thoroughly enjoy musical theatre. Its a big time commitment. You have to watch 2 hour musicals twice a week. She's a pretty easy grader, but it is completely possible to get a B in this class.",1866
rothman,4,A,HONR238D,"Dr. Rothman is super nice, a great speaker, and a lot of fun to talk to. Make sure to show up to class everyday to get participation points (you can lost 2% for every class you miss), and make sure to have interest in musicals before signing up for this class, because it won't be awfully fun if you have zero interests. The homework generally consists of watching a musical every week, which honestly isn't stressful at all. The class consists of an in class presentation, about 3 very short papers, and a final presentation. Not too much work, but these few things do take up a bit of time, especially since their are very few guidelines for these assignments. Also their is a lot of extra credit available!",1866

rothman,5,A,THET110,"Initially, the only reason I took this class was to get credit for my HA Core.
In the end, it was the same reason, but I actually learned interesting material in here.
I was in the 3:30 class, so I did fall asleep occasionally, but since I sat in the front, it wasn't too bad.
They give points based on attendance, so unfortunately you do have to come to EVERY single class.
Really - COME, because the TA's have a paper with the student's faces on it, so once they know your face and don't see you are there, they will mark it down.
She's really strict on the ""no technology rule"", so make sure that once class starts you put your phones away and iPods because she'll call you out.
Overall it was a good class, she's funny, doesn't mind dropping a few curse words here and there, and you'll walk out feeling like you learned something.

Oh - 2 papers on 2 plays, extra credit, quizzes every other week, about 5 or 6 plays to read.",1866
rothman,3,,THET110,"I hated/survived this class. I really don't have any interest in theatre. Rothman is really passionate about the subject, however. There is absolutely no texting in class and she enforces it very well. 

So the class is a decent A. I mean people say that it's the easiest A, but it actually isn't. You have to put in considerable amount of effort to get an A. Doing the extra credits, reading the plays, and etc. 

Honestly, if you are looking for an easy HA course, take MUET210 with Rios. Amazingly easy. I can guarantee that if you have any interest in music, this will be a better choice. If you have any interest in theatre, take Rothman. 

",1866
rothman,5,A+,THET110,"Quite the pleasant instructor. I'll admit her course was light and at the same time interesting. It was overall one of he few courses I took this semester which kept me sane. 
Course requirements : 2 papers, need to see 2 plays( Varies on what UMD is putting on at the time), roughtly 10 short stories and 2 books ( Combined in total it should only be 10 hours of reading). Furthermore there is a potential of 40 extra credit points and 60 points are participation. 
It is overall if you come to class an easy A. ",1866
rothman,4,A,HONR238D,"
I have mixed feelings about Dr. Rothman and this class. Overall, I would recommend 238D for anyone who really enjoys musical theatre or needs a seminar and an HA, but there are a couple things that prevent me from giving her five stars.

Yes, the semiweekly homework is usually watching a musical and reading a couple articles. But these musicals aren't selected for being good or fun to watch; they're chosen for representing topics discussed in class. And when they aren't fun to watch, they're obnoxious timesinks if you want to do well on the quizzes. Dr. Rothman tends to ask a couple pretty specific questions on each one.

The worst part of the class is the big assignments. Dr. Rothman isn't very good at having clear expectations for presentations and papers, and the assignments themselves are surprisingly boring. They include a presentation on an assigned musical, a ""process paper"" about your research on the musical, a review of a live musical, and the final. The final is kind of strange, the only things she requires you do are write another ""process paper"" and present for 15 minutes. How you present your musical is entirely up to your group. Maybe I'm just a whiny engineering major, but this kind of work thoroughly upsets me. The only thing I sort of had fun with was the review. Seriously, what the hell is a process paper? None of this stuff contributes to my understanding of musical theatre.

Negativity aside, the class discussions were generally quite interesting, and Dr. Rothman is funny and enthusiastic. 20 points of extra credit (to 500 total class points) can be earned in a number of ways. She's also very caring, I went to a scheduled ""office hour"" with none of the work I was supposed to have and she played therapist for a while instead of being annoyed with me.",1866
rothman,4,A,THET110,"This is a pretty easy A is you attend class. The lectures can be boring at times but it isn't too bad. Professor Rothman is engaging and pretty funny. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities which is really helpful. Overall, I recommend taking this class if you need to fulfill a HA core!",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,Really awesome professor. She makes the class really interesting and I would recomend her to anyone. the downside is that there's a lot of reading and quizzes but with all the extra credit given its almost impossible not to get an A. Do the extra credit and skim the readings and you'll be fine! I got over a 100% with all my extra credit but I did go to every class. I didn't like all the guest lecturers but the class overall was really great and the midterm and exam were fairly easy (if you did the readings and paid attention). I didn't study for the midterm and i got a 99% so don't worry this class is a really easy A.,1866
rothman,4,A,THET110,"Don't get why everyone was so upset with Prof. Rothman - for such an easy A it's worth at least a little effort. Sure it's not like CCJS or something but for an HA with loads of extra credit, it beats taking a lit class.

Quizzes can be annoying at times and she has strict class etiquette (no cell phones and laptops only if you are taking notes and she has her TAs walk around the room to check) but the class isn't that bad. Got through the whole thing and never once opened the book, just SparkNotes for every reading 15 min before class or skim it on ELMS and your'e good.",1866

I was lucky enough to get a TA who was understanding and an easy grader (Kate Spanos is her name... I highly recommend her), I think the TAs who are actual theatre majors might be a little bit of harsher graders when it comes to the 2 performance papers. 

Overall, great class that I will dearly miss. ",1866
rothman,5,A,,"Awesome class, Dr. Rothman really knows how to manage a discussion in class.  In my other honors seminars I have been let down by the more or less terrible discussions, but Rothman asks good questions to get the discussion rolling and then it just takes off.

However, note that the discussions can be about very disturbing topics. She really challenges you to think outside the box that society has locked us into.  At times thinking outside of this box is difficult, but in the end I was really glad that she forced me to think outside of this box.   

as for workload you have to do one presentation of one of the plays the class has to read, one 10 page play, (which isn't that long if you think about it), lots of mini-quizzes, a response paper to a play you have to see at CSPAC or in DC, and two research papers (one about your research on the play you presented and one about the play you wrote). These research papers are only 3 pages or so.  

The class is about a medium on a difficulty scale, but you won't mind doing the work for this class because it is a great class.",1866
rothman,1,A,THET110,"Honestly this is the worst damn class I've ever taken. Yes, it is the easiest A in the entire world, the tests are a joke, you easily cheat on the quizes without reading, and there is so much extra credit you can get way over 100. On the downside Rothman sucks. I hate her, she's a terrible teacher. She constantly will tell you not to pack up before the end of class and yell and shit. She also goes around the room and picks on students in a lecture class, like stop. Also her wardrobe is a total laughing stock as she owns more button downs that a frat boy. To top it off, the majority of the TA's suck. The only exception is Ann Marie as she is awesome. Erin boone Stelle will yell at you for doing anything, when honestly no on cares about theatre at all. Easy A, but to much goes along with it. ",1866
rothman,5,A,HONR238D,"I LOVE Professor Rothman! She is absolutely hilarious and very knowledgeable about theatre! Her enthusiasm makes the class fun and interesting. HONR238D took up a fair bit of time outside of class (watching musicals) but a homework assignment to watch a movie is always fine in my books! If you enjoy theatre then you will definitely enjoy her class, and you most likely will not find it difficult. She really cares about her classes, offers a lot of extra credit, and is just generally a fun professor. ",1866
rothman,1,a,THET110,"easy A but never have i been more angry at a professor.  during the hour and 15 minutes of hell you could call thet110 professor rothman spends it reading off slides and SCANNING the room looking for people talking, on cell phones, eating, anything that dosent involve paying attntion to her terrible teaching.  i think the a is worth it but i promise u she cares more about catching people messing around than teaching the class",1866
rothman,5,A,HONR238D,"Best class I have ever taken! Dr. Rothman is funny, super nice, and knows what she is talking about. You get easy extra credit (10 points for dressing up for Halloween) and your homework is basically watching musicals. The quizzes can be a little tough, but you'll do fine if you pay attention during the movie. The only quizzes I did badly on were the ones where I barely paid attention and only wikipedia'd the plot. There's also extra credit on all the quizzes. You have a couple of presentations and papers, and you have to go see two shows, but it's really not a big deal. As long as you put in a little bit of time (and start your papers early--don't do it the night before or you'll be up til 6 am), you're likely to get an A. Dr. Rothman is honestly the best, and this class was super interesting and really really fun! I looked forward to every class. Take it!!!!",1866
rothman,5,A+,HONR238D,"Absolutely amazing professor! She cares about all her students and makes the class extremely fun and interesting. Class is almost entirely discussion based, but that is part of what made it so engaging. Dr. Rothman is very knowledgeable and fun. You will learn a lot from this class. Ignore that bad ratings of her because she is one of the best teachers there is.

This class requires a good deal of time, but it is worth every minute. If you don't love musicals at the beginning of the class, you will love them by the end!!

TAKE THIS CLASS!!! You will LOVE it!!!!",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"This is such a wonderful class. I don't really like theatre but  definately did like this class. Dr. Rothman is extremely funny and she keeps students enertained while teaching them the material that they need to know. She knows what she is talking about, and so do the TAs and the guest lecturers. The class mainly consists of a speaker (whether it's Dr. Rothman or a guest), a powerpoint presentation, and discussion of the material. As long as you write down what is on the powerpoint slides and write down things that Dr. Rothman saysare important and will be on exams, you will do fine in this class (I woul sleep half of the time in class and I still got an A). Do the readings assigned also because she does give pop quizzes (the readings are easy and short). The class consists of 13 quizzes (4 of which are pop quizzes) but they are extremely easy if you review your notes (some of the pop quizzes are so easy-like putting your name and birthday on a piece of paper and that's it!). You also have to go see 2 plays and write 2 play reviews, but if you put an appropriate amount of effort into writing these you will get a good grade. There is 1 midterm and 1 final, and they consist of true/false, fill in the blank, short answer, and multiple choice (pretty easy if you actually study your notes and have a basic understanding of the readings). There is also an INSANE amount of extra credit given in this class. You can earn up to 60 extra credit points, so there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to do well in this class if you want to.",1866
rothman,1,B,HONR238D,"I put more time into this class than I did into orgo 2!!  This class generally requires about 6 hours of time each week outside of class watching musicals and reading about them.  Also, 2% of your grade will be taken away for every class period you miss (or even if you show up late).  Her papers require you to follow strict 5 paragraph format with annotated bibliographies (like middle/high school).  The only good point about the class was that it got me  HA and D core credits.
And a word of advice, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN THEATER",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,This is an easy A if you do the reading and show up. She gives enough extra credit points where you have to not work to not get an A,1866
rothman,5,A,HONR238D,"Dr. Rothman is the best teacher ever!!! She made the class really fun and she always has the best stories! From Hair to Hairspray will definitely be my favorite class my whole time here at Maryland. Most of your homework is watching musicals and reading articles about them. You have a quiz on every musical, but if you watched it, you'll do fine. She has an extra credit question on every quiz also. You have class discussions on the musical every class, which are very open. I always felt comfortable talking, and I used to hate seminars. You have a presentation on one of the musicals and you have to go see two shows, and a few papers. There's no final for the class. You have to come up with an original idea for a musical and pitch it to the class in groups. There's also a lot of other extra credit opportunities. We got ten points for dressing up like a character from a musical for Halloween.  Seriously, just take this class. It's awesome and it counts for two CORE credits (HA and D)",1866
rothman,5,A+,THET110,"Awesome class!!!

I have no background in theater, never really liked watching or reading plays, and still don't.
However, Professor Rothman is great. She's hilarious. There were readings due almost every class, and a quiz every Monday. Some of the readings were long, but there are sparknotes for most of them if you don't have time that week. However, it's better to actually read them if you have time because you'll do a lot better on the quizzes.

There were many extra credit opportunities. I went to see 2 plays at Roundhouse Theater and they were 25 pts each. It was fun going with my friends & the plays were actually very good.

I didn't like some of the guest lecturers.

As for the 2 play review papers, they were a little challenging, and were graded a little harshly. And as for the exams, some of the questions were easy, but some required thinking deeply.

Overall, greattt CORE humanities credit, I strongly recommend it.",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"Funny and enthusiastic teacher! She tells great stories and the class is a breeze. Don't skip many though b/c she as pop quizzes based on the readings. Still, the plays are short and the quizzes are cake walks. I had a great time!",1866
rothman,2,,THET110,"If you really want to take THET110, make sure to take it later than 9am..and if you do take it at 9am (which i strongly suggest you don't) make sure you have someone other than Rothman.  She will make you sit through the entire lecture...till the last possibly second, and if you leave early there will surely be a question on an quiz/exam that you miss.  All of the questions on the exam are those she asks in class, at the very end.",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"I enjoyed this class tremendously.  Those who are writing the 1-star and 2-star reviews below did not put any time or effort into this class.

If you give a little bit to this class (READ AND TAKE NOTES) you will get a great deal out of it.  If you go to every lecture, take decent notes, read the readings and study for 15 minutes before every quiz, you will get an easy A in her class.  Good extra credit opportunities as well!",1866
rothman,5,A,,"To some, the subject matter of the plays in this class may be a turn-off; the more off-kilter topics ranged from bestiality to cross-dressing, but keep in mind that this is a class about those who feel like they are outsiders in American society. Assignments are very reading- and discussion-intense, so if you find that the topics do not interest you (whether you support or are against the topic is, fortunately, not consequential), I'd stay away from this class. The final project was to write a short play and act in someone else's--something else to consider and potentially avoid. ",1866
rothman,4,A,THET110,"Overall, I did enjoy the class; I haven't had much exposure to theater and this opened my eyes to it.  However, she is overtly liberal and it was a little distracting to me (not that I'm a hardcore conservative or anything).  I liked her idea for guest lecturers, however they all had different lecturing styles so it was hard to keep up with.  She is very frank with what is going to be on the exam, and the tests are very fair.  Towards the beginning of the semester there were a lot of readings, but they were interesting and relevant to the class.  What mostly broke the deal for me was when she showed something called ""Public Cervix Announcement""...if you haven't heard of it, be thankful.  It was lewd and unnecessary and an example of how her die-hard liberalness got in the way of the class.",1866
rothman,1,A,THET110,WORST CLASS EVER!!! There are 2 pop quizzes in the course as well as readings assigned to each lecture. There are quizzes about the readings and the lectures approx every other lecture. You are required to attend 2 plays and write reviews about them (Harshly graded). On the first day you are told that you MUST attend each lecture and that the TA's have your picture and threaten to deduct points for any missed lectures. This is NOT an easy class to take unless you like readings into specific details about plays. There is also NO curve in the class.,1866
rothman,2,A-,THET110,"Bad teacher. She is mean and does not care about her students unless you are one of a very select few that she decided to like. Lots of quizzes - many have harder questions on them. Class with her is very boring. If you don't like theater or reading or anything involving trying to interpret plays, DON'T TAKE HER! THE CLASS SUCKS WITH HER!",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"Professor Rothman made Thet110 my most fun class this semester.

This class is not a lot of work, there are two required performances to go see at CSPAC, and two-three page papers to write on them.  There are also most weeks plays to read, but the quizzes on them are 5 questions long and multiple choice so you don't need to read the plays that in-depth.  

The lectures are fun and interesting.  She brings in guest lecturers that are directors, actors, dramaturgs.  I have a new appreciation for theater and an HA credit. :)",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"I came into Thet110 somewhat unsure what we'd learn, or how interesting it'd be, but I quickly found it to be a greatly enjoyable class. The lectures are big, so make sure you sit near the front, and stay involved, because if she gets to know you it can be really helpful if you have to makeup a quiz or anything like that, and she's just so nice overall that you just want her to like you.

Workload wasn't too bad - one midterm and one final (non-cumulative), and as long as you take good notes and study them you should be fine. Quizzes about every week, but as long as you at least know vaguely what the play you were supposed to have read was, and you listened in class, you should be fine. For the tests, make sure you've read the plays, though, because they'll be more comprehensive.

You also have to write two reviews on plays put on at CSPAC, but I found those interesting to write also. They're only 2-3 pages, so as long as you take a few notes during the play you'll have plenty to write about, and it won't take you long at all.

Really great class, and I look forward to taking her again.",1866
rothman,5,,THET110,"she is great.
makes class fun and interesting and hilarious.
many guest lectures which is a drag because she is such a great lecturer. 
take her class if you can.
its easy and she is very entertaining.
",1866
rothman,1,A,THET110,She doesnt teach at all. She has people teach for her. She gives quizes but they are graded unfairly because you never get them back so you have NO idea what answers you got right if you forget what you put. And if your grade is different you cant even prove it! Participation grade is based on if she likes you or knows you from previous classes. there are 200 students so not everyone can get called on! so you better hope your the lucky one who gets called on. Dont take attendence but if they think you are absent they take ten points off! Never take this class with her unless you know her!,1866
rothman,4,A,THET110,"Overall I thought the course was simple material. Rothman is an entertaining teacher and she doesn't expect you to memorize much. Reading the plays can be a pain because there are quizzes on them, but she isn't out to trick you. 

The class consisted of 2 play reviews, 8 or so quizzes, 2 pop quizzes, a midterm, and a final. LOTS of extra credit opportunities offered. Very straight forward class.

The only issue I had was that she brought in A LOT of guest lecturers and had the TAs teach some material because it wasn't something she was an ""expert"" on. While I agree with that, some of these guest lecturers were bland or boring and it was not fun to listen to them speak for an hour and fifteen minutes. 

Overall, a great class. ",1866
rothman,5,A,THET110,"Awesome teacher. Lots of guest lectures, which can sometimes make the class a bit dull if they're uninteresting, but having a new voice and a new persective on theatre makes this class an easy HA credit. Not too much work. Lots of quizzes (easy, used sparknotes for a lot of the plays and did fine), attendence is a must. She's very animated and has a great sense of humor. LOVED her.",1866
rothman,5,,,"Dr. Rothman is the best! Love her teaching style, love the class, even the work made you think as opposed to the usual busy work.  For those looking for an actual thought/conversation based honors seminar, look no further.",1866
rothman,4,A,,"Professor Rothman is really great. She is reasonable, funny, and definitely knowledgeable. She'll help you out if you are ever unclear about assignments and she facilitates discussion very well.

HONR219P class assignments included five two-page journals, a presentation and paper, and a ten-page play on a topic of choice that concerns outsider-ship. Most of the non-written work is in reading plays. There are a lot of them, and there are short quizzes on them. Grading is more than fair, but you have to do the reading. The class is almost entirely discussion based.

The class itself is kind of different when it comes to subject matter. The class can really push you to think about what is and isn't acceptable  to you and why. If that isn't your cup of tea, I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but overall I think the class is pretty good and that the professor is great. ",1866
rothman,5,A,BSCV191,"I love Dr.Korey, she has made Civicus this year so engaging, if you take the time to email her about your situation then she will accommodate you and be understanding. ",1866
miler,4,A-,GVPT473,"Reasonable.  Would probably take any class taught by her so long as the subject matter was of interest to me.  Assessments are fair, grading is more or less 20% participation, a midterm,  a final, and 1 paper.    ",1870
miler,3,,,"Look, Miller is not bad, she has decent lectures, but there are some minor but annoying issues. One, I know that we are doing work online, but her lectures are all prerecorded on Panopto in such horrible quality that you might as well ignore them, just like I did. You get 2 textbooks, if you read them properly and take even the most basic notes you will pass. We did not have a midterm due to online school, but 2 papers. For me they were easy, but for many kind of difficult. Discussion was not really necessary, but did not detract from the class overall. Not a bad class.",1870
dorsey,5,A-,CCJS100,"Really awesome and funny professor, I highly recommend him. The class was easy with minimal-moderate effort.",1871

dorsey,5,B,CCJS105,"I could not recommend a professor more than I recommend Dorsey. He really knows his stuff, and never had a question he couldn't answer. He is also HILARIOUS and tells great stories when going over lecture material. I genuinely looked forward to going to lecture. Overall loved this class. ",1871
dorsey,4,A,CCJS105,Sometimes I get the feeling he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. His slides are way too long and he doesn’t really elaborate on anything. He is very funny and entertaining and his exams aren’t really that bad if you come to class. ,1871
dorsey,3,A-,CCJS105,"He is definitely a cool guy and he's a funny professor. He keeps lectures interesting but the class is pretty difficult. The first test tricks you into thinking that the rest of the class will be a breeze and then the other two tests are TERRIBLE. My GPA is a 3.85 and even I thought this class was one of the more difficult classes I've taken. If you struggle remembering theories, then this class definitely is not for you. ",1871

dorsey,5,A,CCJS105,Legit best professor ever! Super funny and such a great guy! He really wants the best for his students! As long as you read the assigned readings and take notes you will do great in the class! Definitely take his class whenever you get the chance!!!,1871
dorsey,5,A,CCJS105,Amazing professor! I wish I had more time to interact with him as his class was asynchronous but he provides really memorable and funny examples to help you learn the material,1871
sayer,5,A+,SOCY325,Liana is a great professor. You can tell she really knows the material and likes engaging in discussions about it. The coursework is very straightforward and easy if you know the material. I found the textbook online for free. Half of lectures were synchronous and the other half were asynchronous. ,1876

zou_linda,5,A+,PSYC232,I took the Psychology of Racism with her and she is by far the best psych professor I've had. She is caring and really does want everyone to succeed. Her grading is clear and assignments are straightforward and arent overwhelming. ,1877
fourakis,4,A,HESP403,"Fourakis is very kind and friendly. He likes engaging with students and clearly likes what he teaches, and his emails are always nice. His class isn't super engaging (he talks slowly and draws diagrams during class over Zoom which takes a long time) but it's okay, especially since he records lectures and you can watch them on 2x speed. 

He is a really forgiving grader - HW are mostly graded for completion and there was no exam, so the grade is just comprised of participation and HWs. 

I think he's had some trouble adjusting to the online format but he's so nice and the class is very straightforward so the class is okay overall. ",1883
copelman,5,A+,ECON305,"Tough, but a good professor. You have to go to class",1885

copelman,4,A,ECON305,"she's passionate and experienced with econ. however her teaching style is dry and boring. you must show up to class to earn learning catalytics poitns. her TA's were something else. her exams are extremely tough, but she curves and provides extra credit options. ",1885

copelman,2,,ECON305,good teacher but CURVED BACKWARDS?,1885
copelman,1,,ECON305,"Blatantly Rude & no self-awareness. Had her for more than 1 course at a time and both classes had a failing average for exams, yet she'd blame the students for poor preparation. Puts insanely quick time limits on exams & gives no partial-credit. Complains about lack of participation but always talks down to students who ask 4 help. 0/100 - would not recommend. 

appears talking down to students may be a genuine hobby of her's. ",1885
copelman,1,,ECON330,"Do NOT take her. She is extremely disrespectful of her students and has extremely high expectations with zero preparation for them. In a forced-online environment, she does not give us any chances to succeed at all and holds zero accountability in terms of admitting her own mistakes. ",1885
copelman,1,,ECON305,"Please do not take her unless you want to fail. She is terrible... I've never had such a low grade in any class ever. Her exams are extremely difficult and her grading scale is unreasonable. On top of that, she is not understanding at all and blames the students for her incompetency. Sad I had to pay to deal with this..",1885
copelman,2,A,ECON330,"Clearly very knowledgeable and experienced, but struggles with the online format and fails to understand why students don’t immediately grasp concepts. Students teaching one another (such as myself) have contributed much more to finer details on topics than her short video quizzes and homework assignments. Far from the worst professor I’ve ever had, but if you don’t have any prior interest or experience in banking or finance, you may find yourself treading water.",1885
copelman,1,,ECON305,"Listen, do yourself a favor and don't take her. She has easily become one of the WORST professors I've ever taken. This is the first time I'm compelled to write a thorough review because I don't want anyone to have to pay to deal with this absolute joke of a class and her lack of self awareness. I have PTSD from this class and it's not even over yet.
Background: I'm a Business student and this is easily the hardest class I've taken this semester, Econ isn't even my major but I've done well on past courses.
Structure:
1. Exams: Her exams are an absolute nightmare. This semester we have 5 exams (75% of the grade) which is a little extra but not too bad right? WRONG. These exams are extremely difficult. We don't even have enough time to think through the concepts because she expects you to know the answer right after you see the question. It's a 30 minute exam with material that we haven't even learned with many parts questions and honestly, an absolute nightmare.
2. Professor's lack of accountability: She makes a Groupme for every class to listen to the students? no. She reportedly says she will ignore it because we are becoming little babies and complaining too much. The first exam was fairly simple concepts but the class average was 50% because nobody had enough time. She agreed it was a little rough, but we aren't studying enough. She basically sugarcoated it and called us all stupid. And she didn't curve the exam. It seems like she has no self awareness, she thinks she's right and we're all wrong and will not listen to any suggestions and is not accommodating AT ALL. 
3. Course load: The course load isn't too bad to be honest, it's all HW on Pearson and some video quizzes that are pretty straightforward. Attendance is mandatory because there are LC questions going on during class in which you get participation grade. But you know what sucks? She had class when the university specifically closed all classes due to snow and bad weather and had the audacity to still grade the class because we're all babies and she's doesn't care. 
Summary: I get good grades and this is the first time I'm basically failing every exam. Well, the whole class is but the exams aren't curved. We're basically just waiting till the end of the semester to see if she can find it in her cold heart to give us a curve. She curved backwards last semester apparently so.... maybe I shouldn't be too hopeful. This class will make you 100% more stressed than you need to be, college is already so hard and nobody needs this in their life. I'm not being dramatic, I'm really trying to help whoever is reading this. Literally I don't think I know anyone who had a positive experience with her. I'm thinking of dropping this class..... and I don't ever do that. If you can avoid taking her, avoid her at all costs.",1885
roesch,5,A,,"Dr. Roesch is a great professor. The material (learning and behavior) isn't the most interesting unless you're a fan of neuroscience, but he makes it easy enough to understand and learn. The course isn't too difficult, as long as you pay attention. Attendance isn't mandatory, but there are in-class activities that help you understand the material and are a part of your grade. The exams are okay; you definitely have to study, but it's mostly memorization. He is more than willing to help you if you don't understand something. He also shows a lot of pictures of his golden retriever, which is awesome. Overall, I'd recommend this course. ",1888
roesch,3,,,"Don't get me wrong, the professor is a great guy. But the course is for what it is worth at times very dry and boring.
The material-wise the course likely is one of the most useful a psych and behavioral neuroscience major can take. However his examples on more than one occasion suck, he goes very fast in class, and his tests are hard.

In the end I'd say take it because it's a good course. But be prepared to be self-motivating and stare at his powerpoints for prolonged periods of time until they 'click'. ",1888
roesch,5,A+,GEMS396,"Matt is my Gemstone team mentor, and he is a great guy to work with. He gave a guest lecture in BSCI338N on addiction, and his lecture was by far the most informative and entertaining of all the guest lectures. He is very patient and approachable, so my advice to his future students is this: go to his office hours, because he will drop anything he is doing to help you out.",1888
cropper,5,A,ECON423,She was a great teacher who is always willing to help her students. If you can take any class with her do it. Also for 423 her tests are almost identical to past semesters so the averages are all above an 85. TAKE CROPPER!,1890
cropper,5,A,ECON422,"I liked Cropper. She was very clear in her explanations in class that could definitely be really tough. She tried to learn peoples names and was extremely respectful to us and was happy to answer questions. I felt like I learned alot in the class.

Her quiz questions are taken from a list of problems she hands to us a week or so before hand. There really is no reason to not ace them. On the tests she mixes things up a little but still if you did well on the quizzes and generally understood what was going on they are not hard. We also had projects in Stata which were useful and also easy.

In general I felt like I learned a lot and was a pretty easy A.",1890
cropper,4,A,ECON422,"She got injured halfway through the semester so I didn't see her from mid-October to the end of the semester but she seems like a nice lady. If you have to take 422, take it with her. She makes it as easy as it can possibly be and allows notes on each quiz and exam. It isn't an easy subject but I feel I would've gotten more out of it if she hadn't been injured.",1890
cropper,5,,ECON422,"Dr. Cropper is an overall great professor! Econometrics is not easy material, and it wouldn't be hard for a professor to make the class miserable.  Dr. Cropper is the opposite.  She does her best to help students learn the material! She often provided handouts to students so that we could follow her explanations in class and not be consumed in her lecture.  She was very thorough with her descriptions and explanations and very approachable outside of class if you need help, or in my case, need a grade to be fixed.

The grading is pretty straight forward.  There were five quizzes throughout the semester-she allows you to drop the lowest one.  There are two exams-a midterm and a final.  There are three computer projects, each worth like 5%.  The computer projects are based on using regression tools, and if you attend the project sessions, a 100 should almost be a guarantee.

If you attend class, pay attention, read the book, and ask questions, you should be fine.  She hands out problem sets, which are great preparation for the exams (she basis exams/quizzes off of them).  She will go over almost all the answer to the problem sets in class and allows a sheet of notes for the quizzes and exams.  She also provided review sessions prior to the exams.  Reading the book helps if you 're confused, but the best thing to do is to attend class and possibly find someone to work with you in a study group!  It might take a little while to adjust to her style and grasp the material, but be patient and keep trying to learn-you'll catch on eventually.  Good luck!",1890
cropper,5,A,ECON422,"Dr. Cropper is one of the best professors at Maryland.  She is very approachable outside of class and will do anything she can to help you out.  She is very straightforward and really makes econometrics interesting.

Take her any chance you get.",1890
cropper,5,A+,ECON422,"Dr. Cropper is a very smart woman and covers the material in depth. She uses real life examples to make the material more comprehensible. While she makes it very easy to get an A in her class (e.g. having quizzes identical to practice questions and allowing notes during exams), I would definitely recommend reading the book, preferably before class. Lectures can be pretty fast paced and it may take a bit of time to get comfortable with the concepts. She is very approachable and clearly wants students to succeed. ",1890
kearney_monica,4,A+,PSYC354,"Super easy class, and the topics are fairly interesting. There are random clicker questions and in-class work, so you have to go to class, but it's a good way to get easy points. There are only 2 exams and one paper. Overall, it's a solid choice for a class without too much work. ",1891
kearney_monica,5,A,PSYC354,"Honestly one of the best psych professors I've had, super understanding and sweet. As long as you pay attention, the course material is easy to understand. Definitely a passionate and nice professor and an easy class to pass.  ",1891
kearney_monica,2,B-,PSYC354,Monica is a nice professor though I would not take another course she teaches again. Her TA's grade unnecessarily hard where this should be an easy enough course. I am a psych major and have never received any grade lower than an A- in a psych course besides this one.  Along with this be ready for loads of busy work and useless discussion posts every week that do not help with understanding the course concepts at all. I would not recommend taking this class unless you enjoy pointless work and hard grading for no reason at all. ,1891
kearney_monica,5,,PSYC354,"One of the nicest and most understanding professors I've had. The workload was really fair and the assignments were pretty easy. The lectures were also super interesting. Maybe I just had a different experience than the other reviewer here, but the TAs that graded my assignments seemed pretty lenient and the averages for all of them were around 90%. If you felt that something was graded unfairly, she was also very open to regrades.",1891
spivey,5,B+,GVPT431,"Best professor I've ever had in my collegiate life. You'll never be bored in lecture. Never. He'll get everyone involved, even in a 250-seat lecture hall. You'll learn more in this class than any other you've ever had.

Exams and assignments are more than fair, and very straight-forward. If you go to class and listen to his world-famous hypotheticals, you'll be fine.

He's had a ton of experience with the law, and is an insanely smart dude. Has more degrees than I can count, and just earned his PhD from Maryland a few months ago.",1900
spivey,5,A,GVPT431,"Prof. Spivey is a tricky guy to evaluate. The discussions during class are fun and very informative. You will learn a lot about topics that relate to daily life, and learn to assess and evaluate case law. Exams are fair and test to see if you know the general idea of what is going on in the class. 

",1900
spivey,5,,GVPT431,"Awesome professor. Very intelligent, actually an attorney with a lot of law and political experience out in the field which he tells the class about when it's relevant. Very friendly and open, has weekly scheduled lunches with students in the dining hall in an effort to get to know them. 

The material is good stuff too, you learn about a LOT of Supreme Court cases, though it might not seem like it all the time, but all the material falls together like a puzzle to make his larger point about govt structure and SCOTUS. 

Speak up in class! But be ready to think on your feet, he doesn't wait for you to get your thoughts together, things move fast and he challenges anyone who speaks up, there's no bsing or intellectually 'getting away with it.' It can be a little unnerving and embarrassing at first, but he's a really nice guy, so it's not personal, he's just trying to get you to think.

Don't know why first review made a big deal about Bush v. Gore - he reads these reviews and he made an effort to not be biased after reading that.",1900
spivey,5,B,GVPT431,"As a Government and Politics major this was easily one of the best classes I have ever taken.  It's not a great class because it's easy, it's a great class because of Professor Spivey.  He constantly challenges you on your beliefs and makes you really think about what you believe and how you think this country should be run according to the Constitution.  If you have ever had any question about the Constitution or not, take this class because afterwards it may be answered, but you might start questioning it more yourself and whether it can be improved.  Amazing class that I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys law.

And yes while he hates Bush v. Gore, he's right it's a stupid case.  But you won't do poorly if you get it as a case, he's not that biased.",1900
spivey,5,A,GVPT439C,"Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had. If you are thinking about law school, definitely take one of his classes, he's a great resource and gives a great introduction to Constitutional law.
I've taken both 431 and 439C with him and they have been my favorite classes to go do. Same structure of the class- two papers (usually one brief and one opinion), a midterm and a final, with one presentation of a case during the semester for participation. Also, sometimes a random 1 page or a couple paragraphs asking us what we think of a case or a decision. You will not regret taking his class, and its worth going to lecture for, although I suppose you could skip if that's your thing. ",1900
spivey,5,,GVPT431,"Dr. Spivey is a great teacher with a balanced approach to the law. In 431, American Constitutional Law, you'll spend about 1/3 of the course looking over the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers. 

The rest of the course is spent reviewing and arguing Supreme Court cases which contain some sort of constitutional question. You have somewhat of a choice, but ultimately you are assigned one of these cases and expected to present, as a petitioner or respondent, an oral argument before the class. Bush v. Gore is an option, but don't pick it. If you have to argue Bush's side, you're in for it; Spivey hates that court decision (with good reason).",1900
spivey,4,A-,GVPT431,"Massively overrated, but still a good teacher.  I simply don't understand the cult of personality around this man.  Class isn't too hard if you just show up and listen/take notes, grading expectations are reasonable. ",1900
vilar,5,A+,ANTH222,I took him over the winter semester for anth222. Very friendly guy with a lot to share. His tests are very fair if you pay even a bit of attention in class and the out of class assignments are not very time consuming nor difficult. The labs are mostly just busy work. though,1902
sarna,1,B,ECON317,"Sarna is boring and talks quietly. I found it very difficult to pay attention in class. He posts all of the slides online and the review slides closely correspond with the exams. Because of this, most people didn't come to class except to give their presentations. There is no homework except for a big presentation/group paper, which he grades leniently. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. He never uses it. This course is a glorified intermediate macroeconomics course. Although I did not like Sarna's teaching, he is very helpful and cares about what he is saying. If you can bring yourself to come to class and pay attention, you'll probably do fine.",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON201,"Professor Sarna is by far the best teacher I have had at The University of Maryland, he does an excellent job making sometimes challenging concepts about ECON easy to understand, he goes over concepts multiple times and draws out tons of examples.  Further, he is very responsive to students needs, for example he made us a mock exam and the TA's gave it too us in class for each exam and that was insanely helpful and was similar to the questions on the regular exam.  In addition he has review sessions in class.  The only thing I would recommend is that you sit in the front because he writes on the board a lot and is hard to see in the big lecture hall.  You cannot rely on the power points in order to get an A because the on board examples is where you do a lot of learning.  Excellent teacher, take him not Neri! ",1904
sarna,4,A-,ECON317,"I took this class my senior year at UMD and I wish I had taken it earlier. Sarna's class is one of the few econ classes where i learned concrete info about how world economics work and allowed me to understand and easily interpret changes in the world economy or even simply reading the WSJ or the Economist. Its not an easy A as his tests are tricky and are often frustrating because of hazey wording. However, the material itself is straightforward once you understand how the different variables effect each other. I learnt the most about actual econ in my entire time at UMD in this class, instead of just how to move curves around and take derivatives. Also econonmetrics with Vlaicu is a great class but im not sure he teaches at umd anymore. anyways, take this class, study hard, you will be grateful once you graduate. also keep the textbook its helpful for me to refer to sometimes to brush up my knowledge. this class should be required after econ 200/201. and it should be broken up into two classes so as not to cram so much into one semester and allow time to really drill the concepts in.
",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON201,Made the class very easy to understand. One of the best professors I've had so far. He is very knowledgeable in economics. Explains concepts simply and makes sure students understand the fundamentals. Exams were fair,1904
sarna,5,A,ECON201,"Just got  my grade for the class and wanted to write a review for Professor Sarna because he definitely deserves one.  

Economics is my major so I'm very into the material. Lectures were enjoyable for me. Professor Sarna knows his stuff. He teaches in a manner that forces you to understand the models and apply them when tested. He doesn't want his students to memorize and then just regurgitate the material come exam time. And his teaching style reflects that. He is VERY approachable and very nice. He really wants his students to understand the material and do well in his classes.

I didn't go to a single discussion and found that reading the chapters in the book prior to lectures was very beneficial. Midterms and the final averaged B/B- for the class. Final grade was curved by 3%. 

Fairly easy class though it will require some diligence as it is a 4 credit class. Bottom line if you have to take ECON201 take it with Professor Sarna. He is an excellent professor.

Update: I took his ECON317 policies class. He has to be one of the best econ professors I've had. He has lots of real world experience and he brings that knowledge into the classroom. Great lecturer, great class. The class does require considerable effort though if you want an A. ",1904
sarna,4,B,ECON317,"He really knows what he is teaching and wants students to learn things for the real world. He is a nice guy and very approachable. It was hard for me to get an A because I am not a great test taker. There is 2 quizzes, 2 exams(MCQ & short answer), group projects, 6 article summaries (easy). He is straight forward on what exactly he tests on.",1904
sarna,5,,ECON317,Dr. Sarna is definitely in my top list of professors at UMD. He really makes the material very interesting and explains the material very well. He is an absolute genius when it comes to economics and turns explains material with easy to understand stories. I would recommend this professor!!! ,1904
sarna,5,A,ECON200,"One of the best professors I've had at UMD. He explains very complex charts and relations in a very simple manner that makes them seem common sense. He tries to make lectures enjoyable and is very good at what he does. The book is not that boring either so if you get lost, reading up won't be too bad, although the book isn't absolutely necessary because his slides are very good",1904
sarna,5,,ECON200,"Best econ class ever. he is funny, explains the material in a very comprehensible manner, and the tests are very very very easy... as long as you have actually somewhat paid attention to lecture/read the text book you'll do just fine. the only problem was the aplia problems. i thought they were more difficult than the exam questions but when i went to get help the TAs weren't allowed to answer our questions. ",1904
sarna,4,B,ECON200,"Sarna is a great professor but the class is difficult.  He's very approachable and will go to every length to help a student.  He relates the class to real life and keeps it interesting.  However, the TAs are absolutely useless.  I went to discussion once and it was a true waste of time.",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON200,"Great professor. Really no complaints. Clear explanations, clear powerpoints, easier tests than the other sections (i think). Wants everyone to do well and he tells us that he is our ""friend"". Has a slight accent which may be unclear at times but just listen carefully and you will be fine. If you need to take micro definitely take Sarna. 

I actually ended up with a B in this class but that's because I stopped studying the material towards the end of the final. THat was a mistake. If you keep up with the material there is no reason why you should get less than an A. ",1904
sarna,5,B,ECON200,"Sarna is a really great professor! Unlike other professors I've had in the past, he really cares about how well his students do in the class and wants them to really understand economics. 

I ended up getting a C+ in the class (78!!) because i get really bad test anxiety but thats a whole other issue. 

If you take your time with the course and look at it simplistically (microeconomics is a pretty simple subject that can get confusing if you think too much about it)you should do fine. His exams are not even directly from any readings from the textbook so mainly pay attention in lecture and/or go to his office hours you should get a B or higher.

The only thing I didnt like was that the other class got to do an extra credit assignment and we didnt! It probably would have brought my borderline C to a B. ",1904
sarna,4,A,ECON200,"Professor Sarna has a great sense of humor! For Micro, it wasn't really necessary to go to lecture though, because he posts his lecture powerpoints online after class, and they include information that's all in the textbook. 

He genuinely cares about his students though! On the first exam, I guess many people didn't do very well, so he dedicated twenty minutes of the next lecture asking the lecture (of over 200) what could make a difference for them on the next exam. We also have mock exams before every exam.

He was a little rude a few times when people asked questions in class, but I think it was mostly unintentional. Overall, good professor and easy class!",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON200,"Awesome professor, awesome class. Challenging at times, but it's really not that hard at all as long as you keep up with the content. All the topics build upon each other as you progress through the course so just make sure to keep up. Sarna is great at teaching and I definitely learned a lot. If you have an interest or need the course, take it.",1904
sarna,4,B,ECON317,"If you are not familiar with macro concepts this class might be a little tricky for you. There were 3 quizzes, a midterm, a paper/presentation, and the final. Paper/presentation was easy, around 20 pages split between 4 people and a presentation that lasts ~20 minutes. 

He explained things clearly and kept things relevant, using the first few minutes of class to discuss world economic events and how we could use what we've been learning to explain what's going on. Funny guy too. Be prepared to put in a good amount of time for the class, there's a lot of info to cover/understand.",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON200,"The material is straight forward and he follows the textbook very closely.  I definitely would have skipped lectures if another professor was teaching but he's too funny.  If you actually listen to his lectures, he's a really funny guy, although not always intentionally.  For the first few weeks, he somehow managed to mention Georgetown cupcakes in every lecture.  If you need to take an econ course and he's teaching it, definitely take him!",1904
sarna,4,B,ECON200,"How well you perform in this class depends on how much you understand the concepts presented in the lectures. Therefore, attending class is mandatory. Having said that, this class will teach you a lot of things about the world of economics and how they relate to every day's life. 

The professor is nice and knows his material. He has an accent but that factor will not stop you from learning what you need to. The power points slides are equally helpful in explaining concepts that are difficult to understand. 

Discussions in general are optional. The professor encourages students to attend discussions but I find them very boring and merely reiteration of the concepts the professor has talked about during lectures. Nevertheless, if you don't understand something in lecture, come to discussions for clarification.

You will have several problem sets during the course which will be online. I suggest you start them early as some questions might take up a bit of time. The course has a midterm and a final, they are straightforward and cover the topics have been talked about during lectures. 

I personally recommend this class because it can be very interesting once you understand the concepts and able to make the connections from the classroom to everyday's life.",1904
sarna,5,,ECON200,"Professor Sarna was a great teacher. For my first time taking Economics, I definitely learned a lot and it was not at all difficult. In this class, we had homework every other Sunday and only 2 tests throughout the year and one final. The final wasn't cumulative. All of his lecture slides are online. I never went to discussion because I didn't need to because he taught everything well in class. This class did not give me any stress.  Definitely take him for Economics!!!!!",1904
sarna,5,A,ECON200,"Professor Sarna was great for my first experience learning economics. He explains the material clearly, and always adds in little jokes to keep the class intresting. All the matrial can also be learned from reading the textbook and reviewing his powerpoint slides which he posts online, so its not a big deal if you miss a class or space out. His tests are very fair and if you understand all his powerpoints, you will do fine. I'm definitely taking him for ECON201 next semester. Discussion is pointless. I only went once this semester.

If I did not have a heavy schedule, I would have received a B in his class. There are 2 quizzes 1 midterm 1 project (presentation & paper) and 1 final. He's not as boring as other economic professors, which is a plus. He has a slight accent but it does not affect his teaching style/ability. Overall I enjoyed the course.",1904

There is significant reading in this class, and you will be expected to do your share of the intellectual legwork.    ",1914
coughlin,5,A,ECON306,"Professor Coughlin has to be the most considerate professor I've had besides from Verma (ECON230). He structures the first half of the course going over key micro principles. The latter half, he skips around in the book covering topics in a more logical order. Trust me, if you study in the order he teaches them, the information flows better. He'll also set aside time to cover larger topics such as public choice, game theory etc. This actually help you gage what's interesting/clicking in your head and you can go on to register for those specific respective classes at the 400 level. 

He has 2 midterms, 1 final, and weekly Aplia hw - no discussion/clicker/attendance stuff. The material he covers in class is directly from the book just in detail with lengthy run-through explanations. The exams and hw are TRICKY but DOABLE. Make sure you know the concepts well and HOW TO APPLY THEM! I think he drops one hw but they are freebie points anyways since the answers are often available online. Before each exam, he has TAs set up review sessions to go over concepts and last minute questions we all have. The TAs are all very knowledgable. Svetlana is the best at explaining concepts, Prateik is best for the game theory chapter, Hao will give you the most straight forward answers to the math application problems.

When the grades come out for each class, he likes to run stat models on them and use a regression model to make the class average around 80. This means you could potentially get a 60% and be bumped up to 75% depending on the respective curve. It really helps those that are towards the bottom but not so much so those that do well to begin with. 

IN THE END: Go to class, ask questions, put in a decent effort and it's not hard to walk away with a B!",1915
coughlin,1,B,ECON306,This is my second time having Coughlin and he has been a horrible lecturer each time. He always seems nervous and is undeservedly rude to his TAs. Lectures are dry and the material covered in them is easy theory and straight from the book. Definitely buy the book. The homework questions and exams are difficult - much more in-depth and complicated than any of the lectures. Don't worry about going to class. Just read the chapters and do all of the homework questions yourself - even though you can find the answers to basically all of them on CourseHero.,1915
coughlin,4,A,ECON200,"I enjoyed having Coughlin for ECON200. He taught the material very well (although pretty monotonously the majority of the time), and there was never a time during lecture where I didn't totally understand what he was teaching. However, this can also play as a downfall. His ability to teach the material as if we are in elementary school made it seem to the majority of the class that the course would be a total breeze, and I definitely knew of people that had trouble especially on the exams. His exams, although not hard per se, were definitely on the tricky side, but he curves them so that the average is in the mid 80s. However, there was seldom any material that he taught during class that you couldn't have learned from the textbook. The only work besides the exams was the online homework, of which is extremely easy, and even if you can't find the answers, they are bound to be somewhere online if you look it up on Google. I can't say for any other microeconomics professors, but if you don't want to work too hard for a B (or A for that matter) in this class, take Coughlin.",1915
coughlin,2,,ECON200,"This class was SO pointless. The hour and 15 minute lectures drag on so much to the point that MAYBE 50 people will show up from a 400 person lecture.  The content is incredibly easy, but the midterms and tests are very tricky and do not reflect the easiness of the homework and the lecture content.  He is very condescending to his TAs, but overall seems like a nice guy.  Just very boring and not a good professor.  We only got through 2/3 of the textbook material while other classes (with different professors) got though their entire book and seemed to have legitimate knowledge about the subject, unlike me.",1915
coughlin,3,B+,ECON306,"Dr. Coughlin is a nice person, but he really doesn't teach the material well for this class. The hw doesn't really relate to what we learn in class. I didn't miss a single class and still did badly on the exams, except for the first one. I had him for 200, and I think he was better at teaching that material than this one. I wouldn't recommend this class, Dr. Coughlin really did not teach the material well. 

And it's kind of annoying how he uses the projector and the computer at the same time. The notes just kind of become very disorganized. ",1915
coughlin,1,-A,ECON200,"Coughlin was just a boring teacher. He actually had to point out which parts of his lecture were not from the textbook. The tests were a little tricky, but only because he didn't provide any good study material. TA's said the best way to study is using questions at the end of each chapter (not aplia), but they never provided us with the answers to those. By the end of the semester 100 people showed up to his 300 person lecture. Not bad for a guy who makes $73k in 2013",1915
coughlin,4,A+,ECON200,"Professor Coughlin is very fair and wants his students to succeed. The course consisted of two midterm, the final, and online homework assignments from Aplia. Each was worth 25% of the total grade. The tests were fairly easy and he curved so the average was a B. He explained the material thoroughly in his lectures, almost to the point where it became boring, but it was very helpful. 
I would definitely recommend taking his class.  ",1915
coughlin,4,A,ECON451,"Easy enough class. 12 problem sets (graded for completion), 2 midterms, and the final. The final only covers the last third of the course.

Also, don't purchase the textbooks/packets, they're a complete waste of money. I don't know anyone who actually used them.",1915
coughlin,3,B+,ECON200,"I liked Professor Coughlin, he did get off topic sometimes and could be a bore but the class material is pretty easy to understand. Be aware that the tests can get tricky so make you actually study. The TA's are really helpful so go to their reviews before the tests.",1915
coughlin,2,A,ECON200,"While this guy is really nice, he is so boring. He literally regurgitates what's from the book without offering any new insight etc. He talks very slowly. Basically you can read by yourself or with a study buddy and learn twice as fast as the rate he is teaching. I stopped going to class once I realized this ( 2 weeks in)
Some things to note: you don't have to attend lectures or discussions. Some other professors require a clicker but there is no attendance/random quiz. It is straight up 25% HW, 25%",1915
coughlin,4,A-,ECON200,"Professor Coughlin is an absolutely wonderful man. Although this class can sometimes be a bit boring, I never dread going, simply because of the teacher. He is incredibly good-natured and deals with his not-so-good audience with humor. He tells some corny economics jokes which make things a little better. Although his multiple-choice tests are quite tricky, I would recommend this professor. Econ 200 is not much work.",1915
coughlin,4,A,ECON200,"This class was pretty easy for me since I took macro-economics already. He uses powerpoints and slides which make the concepts clear. The homework is fairly easy and counts for 25% of your grade. The other 75% are the 3 tests, which are easy if you get the concepts of the course. If you don't show up to lecture, you won't understand what you're doing. His teaching makes the concepts clear. However, he likes to make corny jokes all the time, which just kills the flow of the lecture. It's very good to read the textbook then go to lecture, I found that helps a lot. A pretty easy class for me, all you have to do is go to lecture and understand the concepts. I barely studied for the 3 tests and got an 88, 97, and 93 respectively. Also, there's a slight curve to the tests, which is always nice. Good class, and decent professor overall.",1915
coughlin,4,A,ECON451,"Unlike any ECON class you'll ever take. A lot of the class seems to be common sense based, but he still teaches it well. Tests can be tricky but shouldn't be a problem if you've studied. Homework due every week, but it's simple. He does move pretty slow, but I guess that helps in the long run. Overall a very nice man who does a good job to communicating the subject matter. I would recommend taking this class.",1915
coughlin,5,A,ECON200,So fun and funny. Sweet man with a genuine passion for the subject. Taking as an upperclassman makes me appreciate his effort to involve a bunch of uninterested and unmotivated underclassmen.,1915
coughlin,4,B,ECON451,"This course is the very definition of ""fair.""  The material is VERY easy too grasp.  Its almost insulting how carefully the professor goes through the material.  I went to maybe 50% of the lectures and ended up with a B. He tries to get the class involved with corny jokes and whatnot but it does make the class that much more bearable.

Homework- The homework is straight-forward but you definitely need to attend some of the lectures to understand what they are about.  (I was able to wiki some concepts but not many)

Exams- 2 exams.  The exams were not hard in any sense. All MC.  He offers very helpful study outlines which are a great supplement (even substitute) to the lectures.  

Final- Ridiculously long. All MC.  Again, not too hard but it will take you at least 1.5 hours to complete.  Some problems require an easy but exhaustive process.  There are a few questions that draw upon reading and lecture-only notes.     

Honestly, this class is not hard but you will have to give that little extra effort for an A.  ",1915
coughlin,4,,ECON451,"I really liked this class. It's different from any other Econ class I've taken, which is refreshing. But, because of that, you are basically required to go to every lecture because otherwise you won't know what's going on.

Dr. Coughlin knows his material, and he teaches in a way that really enforces it. Lectures were small.

Overall, a really good, easy class. I recommend it.",1915
coughlin,3,B,ECON306,"Aplia is annoying as everyone said. The exams are 30 questions or so multiple choice and the average is around an 80 normally. He tries to make the class interesting but doesn't (as most of the econ department). He does test on things not completely explained which sucks. 

As with most UMD econ courses, some of the questions on the tests come out of left field and you have no idea how to do them. You just roll with the punches",1915
coughlin,3,A-,ECON306,"It sounds like this class has changed.  There was no discussion, Coughlin taught everything in lecture.

The Aplia homework can be annoying, but it's really not very difficult.  You will see some of the homework problems on exams, so understand them.

The exams were pretty fair, but a lot of the questions come from lectures, so it might be helpful to attend them.

A lot of the concepts he teaches are theory, yet the exams seem to have a good bit of algebraic/numerical problems.  He doesn't really go through too many of these, but they were on the exams.

Overall, Coughlin isn't such a bad professor, but his exams can be tricky.  It's pretty difficult to get an A, but the top 50% or so should get at least a B.",1915
coughlin,3,B,ECON306,"Professor Coughlin wasn't that bad, I can't say that I enjoyed the class, but it wasn't miserable. The book is more helpful than lecture. He makes corny jokes/shows corny comics in class, but I thought it was sort of endearing. Don't make the mistake that I made and think that there won't be a lot of questions about game theory on the final, it's what dropped me to a B from a 93%.",1915
coughlin,2,A,ECON306,"I hated his class. His lectures are useless, his exams are hard, his voice quite irritating (he sounds like Gilbert Gottfried), korny econ jokes and comics. 2 exams and a cumulative final. Hard to get an A. Some questions are ambiguous including computation problems. Note that he never mentions problems during lecture nor does he explain how to do them. Aplia homeworks are mostly stupid and unrelated. The only suggestion that I can give is read the book to do well on the theory questions and understand how to do the ADDITIONAL GRADED SET problems (only these types of problems are on the exams, not the regular sets). Problems require some basic knowledge of calculus. Don’t even bother going to class. I showed up once in a while just to feel good about myself for not attending class. His lectures are truly just confusing you more. I got an A, his curve on the 2nd and final exam helped.",1915
coughlin,4,A,ECON306,"Coughlin is a good guy. His class is difficult but an A is easy if you keep up with the homeworks.


Do the homework, understand it, and you'll get an A",1915
coughlin,1,,ECON306,"All i gotta say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! he does not get the class involved..and any questions during the lecture are strictly discouraged! Discussion is taught by TA and you'd be very lucky to get a ""good"" TA who can actually answer your questions. Tests are very HARD and full of ambiguous questions. rest is on you..",1915
coughlin,2,,ECON306,"Not a great professor but not a terrible one. Lecture was not mandatory, although you probably will want to attend your discussion section. Aplia was worth 25% of the grade. While the tests were hard, you were allowed to bring a page of notes. I'd advise taking the class with someone else, but Coughlin isn't the worst professor in the economics department.",1915
coughlin,3,A,ECON306,"Boring but you'll know the material. Tempting to skip, but go to class",1915
coughlin,2,C,ECON451,Pr. Coughlin was nice but very dry and boring. His lectures do not prepare you for the quizzes (there are only 2) and the schedule is very vague. He speaks very monotonously and isn't good at communicating concepts. This class is NOT work intensive and has very few assignments. Just read the books on your own and you will be fine. Honestly watching the lectures online (covid times here at umd)made me more confused than not attending.,1915
coughlin,1,,ECON451,Boring and didn't post study guides until the day of the exam. Wouldn't recommend.,1915
murrell,1,,,I didn't have to go to class to pass this class basically. It's the dumbest Gened class ever and i regret taking it because he makes the Midterm and Final so hard for no reason. He is also a petty teacher. He calls students out for using phones or laptops. Unnecessary class with an unnecessary prof ,1916
murrell,2,B-,ECON111,"Word of warning: There's no point in showing up to lectures. I showed up every class with the printed powerpoints (as instructed by him) and found myself hardly ever annotating them because he hardly elaborated on his slides, he just reads straight off of them. The homework is only 15 mins worth of reading for discussion every week (Heath was my TA and he did an excellent job elaborating on the concepts). Honestly though if it wasn't for Econ200 I would have done worse, which is why I only recommend this GenEd if 200 is taken alongside it.",1916
murrell,4,A-,ECON111,"Easy class to get a B in, slightly hard to an A. There are 5 grades. 1st grade: participation quizzes. Once a week in discussion there is an easy quiz based on the assigned readings for the week. Make sure you do the readings. The reading usually took me around half an hour per week. My TA was Heath and he was great and messaged us once a week on what readings to do. 2nd grade: presentation. You make a short presentation with a partner in discussion and present it in discussion. I’m awful at public speaking and blanked at one point and somehow still got a B on it. So dw too much. 3rd grade: midterm. The best way to study for his exams is to do all the practice problems he has available in files on elms. Going over slides can help too but it’s mostly the practice problems. He provides solutions. 4th grade: paper. This is a bit difficult and took me some time but there’s only 1 per semester and it’s due at the end of the semester. Make sure you pick a good article and make a plan. 5th grade: Final. Do the same thing as the midterm. I only studied for each Econ exam for 2-3 hours where I just did his practice problems and got an above average grade each time. And I went to 2 lectures total! His lectures are useless and there’s no point in going. Just make sure to go to discussions.",1916
murrell,2,,ECON111,"Prof Murrell is a nice guy and is knowledgeable about the subject but the class is a major headache for a gen ed 100 level course. I thought I could get through this class without a great deal of stress since I took introductory econ courses in the past but that wasn't the case. The lectures aren't particularly helpful and the tests are hard and graded harshly to the point where I needed curves to get a semi decent grade on them. If you need an i series course, look somewhere else.",1916

swistak,4,B,GVPT390,"Class can be pretty boring as he tends to talk a lot, and the material is often times difficult.  That said, he puts a lot of things into place to make it so that everyone can do well enough in the class, and to make sure the grading is completely impartial.  There's a lot of problems in class for extra credit to keep you engaged and thinking about the problems, although it seemed like mostly three students got all of the extra credit.",1917
swistak,1,,,"Swistak prides himself on the fact that half the kids drop this class halfway through the semester. Obviously, this should not be the case, if the class is inaccessible for most students he should revise it to make it accessible. I hated this class so much and had to drop it despite really WANTING to learn the material simply because he was so full of himself. He doesn't understand that we're not all prodigies who will ace this class like him, and he doesn't understand how to be an effective teacher. He should have to take a class on how to teach and on what it means to be a teacher not just a smart, pompous know-it-all. 
Finally, he grades with negatives, so if you get something wrong, you get points off. This is totally ineffective, as we are not taught this way in other classes and shouldn't have to learn a new grading method just to take a class.",1917
swistak,5,,GVPT100,I took this class freshman year.. I had a low B before the final and after the final i got a D! HATED this class. the true/false was so confusing.. I had to read the question so many times before I understood what it meant. Focuses too much on game theory. get an easier prof if you can! gvpt 100 is not supposed to be this hard!,1917
swistak,2,A+,,"If you're pretty good at math, this class should be very easy. Definitely not very insightful material, the course was really watered down. The course seems to just be for GVPT majors to be exposed to a little math before they graduate. Wouldn't recommend this course, but if it is a requirement toward graduation, here are some tips: Make weekly visits to the TA's and do your homework with them, do the practice exams he gives out, and brush up on your basic algebra.",1917
swistak,5,A,,"Probably the smartest guy in the Government department. He's hilarious too, if you're smart and at least average at math the class is easy.

swistak,5,A+,,"Professor Swistak is probably the most intelligent person I know. 399A requires math/logic and can be difficult for people who are not quantitatively competent. Swistak knows what he's talking about because he has contributed to a great deal of the literature in the field.

Although some people think he does not relay information very well, I think it's just because he comes from Europe where the people are mathematically more learned than Americans. Thus, he moves fast.",1917
swistak,5,B-,,"Swistak is one of the most brilliant people on this campus.  Game theory will change the way you think about the world.  The class is definitely not easy but is worth taking.

swistak,1,B,GVPT100,"Swistak is certainly a professor worth avoiding if you have the chance. Just reviewing his overall class GPA for GVPT100 will show you that he can be more difficult than other professors. Tests can be prepared for by taking notes on his lecture powerpoints.

dubayah,1,B-,GEOG201,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Dubayah makes Geog201 MUCH harder than it needs to be. I'm easily an A/B student and I had a 62% in the class after the final. Because everyone did so poorly in the class, he put a 20% curve on the tests. He's pretentious and very hard to contact. I emailed him almost a week before the exam seeking help and he never emailed back. I even went to his office during the time I had requested to meet with him (to see if maybe I had missed the email or he had forgotten to email back) and he wasn't there. If you're a non-science major, don't waste your time on this class.",1918
dubayah,3,,GEOG201,"Dubayah was an okay lecturer, but I didn't feel like I really learned much from the course at the end of the semester.  There is a lot of information to cover on the tests (though nothing is challenging) but it often felt like we were being tested on minutiae, especially on the multiple choice sections of the exams.  There was a very generous curve built into the exams and the course, so it would be nearly impossible to fail.  There were problems nearly every class with getting the clickers to work, which was really annoying after awhile.  Dubayah wasn't particularly interesting and was kind of aloof.",1918
dubayah,2,B,GEOG201,"I scored B's on all the exams but got an A after the curve. The professor is polite, but he does not make his expectations clear for the exams. You have to study too much material, and the study guides and tests to not marry up. Just be prepared to be able to diagram and explain many concepts. The worst part of the exam is that obscure knowledge will come up and ""headshot"" you out of nowhere.

Passing the class is not difficult, and you can actually pull an A if you do better than the other students, which is not difficult because it is full of frosh/soph who use it to fulfill CORE requirements but didn't have the confidence to take a more difficult or useful course like chem or physics.",1918
dubayah,2,B,GEOG201,"TO EVERYONE: READ THIS BEFORE U CHOOSE THIS COURSE
This is not a Geography class
This is geology, biology, physics, and environmental science class. This class had nothing to do with geography. I am writing this with 100% seriousness. I am not joking about anything. 
This class is hard. 

Dubayah is not a bad guy, but he is really boring. I mean he makes few jokes here and there. It is not really his fault, but the topic that he is teaching is so boring that you just fall asleep.
There is a clicker quiz every lecture that is graded to check if you are in class or not. IT IS NOT ON THE STUFF THAT YOU LEARNED. IT IS A QUIZ ON THE CHAPTER WE ARE GOING TO LEARN SO IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD GRADE ON IT, YOU HAVE TO READ AHEAD. This really messes ur grade up if you don't read ahead.  Also he teaches stuff that is not in the book.  So to get points and learn stuff, you HAVE TO COME TO THE LECTURE. There is no hw, but there is online quizzes you have to do. This can screw your grade up too because it is not easy and there is a deadline for each chapter. The quizzes combined are 15% of our grade. 20% for the first test. 25% for the second test. 40% for the final. One thing I like about Dubayah is that he is really fair. He gives nice curve depending on the class average. 

He is a guy enthusiastic about researching rather than teaching. He is one of those research type professors who leaves almost everything up to the TAs so he can just do the research. This is where the problem begins. The TAs are really bad and they do not care about the students AT ALL. They are lazy and messed up. Only ok TA is Steve. but they grade everything together so you basically have like 3 TAs. The Lab for this class is really easy. GEOG211. Easiest A you will get but the class was 9am in the morning for me. 

The first test average was like 63.
The second test average was like 68.
The final exam average was like 55.

Just long as you get the average, attend every lecture, do the clicker quizzes and online quizzes with everything you got. You will get a B. 
To get an A, you have to do above and beyond.
Get like 20 points better than the avg. 
And actually work really hard and always review and preview.

I got a B in this class.
I attended every lecture but I was not able to read ahead every time.
I got like 83% for the quiz category.
I got above the class average for every test.
I did not pay attention at all. I just crammed everything in one day. I do not recommend this method because it is really hard. You have to pull all niter starting from 3pm to 12pm. Then you might get around the class average. Otherwise you have to study all lot. 

The tests are essays and MC. 
To be 100% truthful. The tests are pretty fair, but there is so much information and little details to remember that it is really hard to get a good grade.
To do well on the test, preview every chapter, review every chapter, pay attention in the lecture, study one week before the exam. 
Easier said than done. And the study guide is pretty good source to study from but for the final exam study guide, he put 28 questions on the old stuff and 5 questions on the easy stuff. But the 90% of the test was on the new stuff. So the study guide is not right all the time. If the study guide was more like the test, I would have got 90% on the test without the curve. 

I was a person who took this as a core, thinking that I would avoid biology, physics, and chemistry because I hate science. I hate science and that is why i took this course but by taking this course, I basically took biology and physics plus geology and environmental science. So do not take this class unless you have to.
UNLESS U R SMART. 
UNLESS U already took physics, biology, and environmental science in high school. And if you were good at it, then take it.
If you like geology then rake this class. 

This is probably the best review you will find in ourumd.com",1918
dubayah,3,B,GEOG201,"Not my favorite professor, but he is willing to answer questions. He doesn't seem as approachable as other professors, and his remarks during lecture sometimes seemed condescending. This course is not terribly difficult, but there is a lot of information to remember. There are three tests throughout the semester, which consist of multiple choice and diagram/short answer questions, plus the final. The diagrams can be complicated and hard to remember. The TAs didn't seem very helpful. You do not have to be a science major to understand the concepts, and many students taking the course take it for CORE, not their major. Don't take this class if you don't need to, or if you're not interested in the subject.  ",1918

Very interesting class if you care about societal issues. Class is primarily focused on synchronous lectures on Zoom, attend and you'll have all the resources to do well in the course. The majority of the class grade comes from the midterm, final, and one paper on homeless shelter interviews. It's a lenient class and Vanneman is very understanding when it comes to conflicts - almost too much so. Good class, would recommend.",1920
engstrom,5,A,GVPT460,"Professor Engstrom taught GVPT460 in a really interesting way: we would read part of a book each week and the discuss for a few hours every Thursday night. I personally like to read, so this “book club” format was nice (though none of the books were very long so I imagine it wouldn’t be bad for those who like reading less than I do). He mostly facilitated conversation, often offering interesting insight, but also let the class do most of the talking when we were on to something. The class is three or so hours but he also made sure to give us breaks. Tests were not difficult either.",1921
choflet,5,A+,AASP202H,"I had Professor Choflet for AASP202H and I really enjoyed the class! He was very accommodating and understanding with students, something that was especially appreciated in our current times. He varied the class between live discussions and prerecorded lectures, which I think was very effective because it was easier to keep up with and made the class itself more interactive. It is a lot of reading- something that he stated very clearly on the first day- but most of it is relevant and if you are interested in black culture, you can find them interesting. And even if you have trouble with a reading, he will probably go over it in class. I also really enjoyed how he included current cultural and artistic pieces like films, photography, music and more. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone considering it! The honors work was the same as the AASP202 work, so all of this also applies to the class in general. I would recommend taking Professor Choflet if you have the chance to!",1923

koulish,5,A-,,"Professor Koulish's class on immigration was perspective changing. It can be difficult to begin a discussion about immigration with people outside of class because of how thoroughly uninformed I realize I was before taking the class. Immigration is a collusion of society, law, sovereignty, economics, and the list goes on, and Professor Koulish is an expert. This class was the tip of the iceberg, and I have since hit the ground running with reading and thinking about immigration and social philosophy on my own and in my course studies. I would recommend reading his book at the beginning of the semester, as it is dense and fascinating, and helps you see where he is coming from.

I'm surprised to see the negative reviews of Professor Koulish, but I will say that his teaching style was very effective in a small class setting with an interesting topic and engaged students. I'm not sure how he would teach a course like GVPT100.

Koulish is receptive to students who want to engage more deeply outside of class. Though he is busy and doesn't always have the time, he has been consistently willing to talk outside of class. He is an inspiration, a very intelligent person, and a formidable individual. If you engage and are interested, you will receive.",1924
koulish,3,A-,GVPT331,"The class definitely was not my favorite and I was not what I thought it would be. Koulish teaches with slides so its easy to follow along and take notes, but the way he teaches this course apparently is really different than how others teach it. As with any class, some material was really interesting and other stuff was really dry. Best advice always go to class because he does not post slides and above all always go to discussion, participate and get close to your TA because they do all the grading. ",1924
koulish,1,A,GVPT331,"After the first day of this class last semester, I was really excited and felt sure that it was going to be an interesting course. However, after that first day, the original professor resigned, and Koulish stepped in.

Then the class became a joke. 

I don't blame the course material, I blame Koulish. He is not an effective professor. His power points are often uninformative. Which would be fine if the words he spoke were informative. But they're not. He constantly puts down the legal profession and talks negatively about lawyers as if he is trying to talk his entire Law class OUT of becoming attorneys. Which doesn't make since if he is a law professor.

I don't think Koulish is a bad person, he just shouldn't be teaching a 300 level GVPT class. Lectures are almost pointless, he posts everything on ELMS. Discussion isn't really worth it either but I think you get participation for going. There was a short paper (easy) and a research paper (also easy) as well as a midterm and a final. I may have gotten an A but it was not a fun experience.",1924
koulish,1,,GVPT100,"Koulish is a Douchebag and also not to say that the class is pointless, which makes it a bad combo. The System that the class works on is total BS. This man has 8 different TAs for a class of less tham 200 students and each TA has their own philosophy which greatly differs from Koulishs. This also reflects on the way exams are graded! Koulish is a wicked man. He knows how hard it is to to come by money, but yet he makes you go out there and buy a custom book that he complied for 100 dollars when in reality you can pass the class without the Book. I can go on forever but i am sure you get the gist  of it. IF YOU love yourself, you'd stay away from Koulish!",1924
koulish,4,A,GVPT100,Koulish was a good teacher. He made what is rly a boring topic relatively interesting. That being said his lectures were really boring despite his efforts. TAs are not bad.

koulish,3,B,GVPT100,"class was soooo boring. honestly i didn't learn jack. there was one midterm, one essay, one final. every thursday we had to email in 2 questions about lecture for our discussion section. Some genius created a google doc where everyone studied together for the midterm and final so dat made everything essay. Got on A on the essay but that's only because my TA Chris was real chill. participation is worth 20% of your grade so keep dat in mind. I would recommend the class if u get chris as a TA. Heard the Anne lady was an a*% tho. ",1924
koulish,1,A,GVPT331,"This was my least favorite class in my four semesters at Maryland. 

I had a lot of problems with Professor Koulish, although I must first say that he wasn't originally intended to teach this class.  The intended professor had to leave after the first week, so Professor Koulish stepped in.  Nevertheless, he did a poor job with this class.

His class is not particularly difficult, yet I wouldn't consider it fair.  For his exams, he provides a powerpoint ""review,"" however none of the topics were on the test.  He gave us a 10-12 page paper near the end of the semester, and a final exam.  The paper was assigned too late in the semester, and he gave very little guidance about what to actually write.

My biggest problems with Koulish came from his lectures.  Not only were his powerpoints messy and hard to follow, but they were also covered with grammar and spelling mistakes.  He rarely seemed prepared.  In addition, his own political beliefs were evident throughout.  He wants you to believe that lawyers who work for the private sector or with the goal of making money are terrible people.  

If you're looking for a LAW class, this is not it.  It is focused primarily on sociology and Koulish's beliefs.  The topics are somewhat related but not cohesive, and the readings are a little random as well.  In addition, he often would not post the reading until the day before it was due. He never responded to a single email I sent him. 

Overall, he was unorganized and not a good lecturer.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first because of the exceptional situation of having to step in at the last minute, but by the end I realized that he is an overall bad professor.  ",1924
koulish,2,C,GVPT100,"Not as great a teacher as everyone is saying. He is totally distant during lectures and packs as many run-ons as possible. He is not easy to follow.

I'm a straight A student and knew the material like the back of my hand but expect a C in this class because I had a ridiculous TA. If you have Anne, switch immediately. She is insanely pen-heavy and an unfair grader. For the first exam, the average in her discussion was a C-. When the average for an exam is that low, you can only blame the students so much. There was clearly a problem. 

There are 2 exams. The final is cumulative. He told us the whole semester that it was non-cumulative until a few days before the exam that it was. You have discussion sections and a 6-8 paper. I would suggest taking this class with someone else.",1924
koulish,2,,GVPT100,"So I had prof koulish for GVPT100
im not a huge political theory person but i took the class to get a better understanding
hes a solid lecturer and what not

he was a dick to students sometimes
the TAs were ok decently helpful
but he is a pretty boting lecturer

koulish,5,A,GVPT100,"Great teacher. His lectures were interesting and enthralling. His tests were really straight forward in that he gave you the essay questions beforehand. If you do the readings and practice writing the essay questions before the exam, you will do great. ",1924
koulish,5,A,GVPT388I,"Great professor! Had him for GVPT388I (the Public Policy Internship seminar) fall 2010. As it is a course that we are required to take if we want academic credit for our internship, he gave us good advise if we needed and asked us every week to talk about the progress we have made at our internships. He did not lecture a lot, it was mostly based on discussions. Since a lot of students were doing internships in campaigns we talked a lot about that. 

As far as work goes, we had one 10-12 page paper to write by the end of the semester related to public policy. We had to choose a topic related to our internships. He asked us to submit a paper proposal and an outline of our analysis for our paper so he could give us feedback in the process. This made it easy to have most ideas organized before the end of the semester and have the 12 page paper done without cramming too much. We also had 2 guest speakers who were pretty interesting.

Overall, great class. 

",1924
koulish,2,A-,GVPT100,"most boring class ive ever taken.  he was a new teacher and i absolutely hated the class.  i learned nothing the entire semester but somehow memorized the important stuff and got an A.  Course consists of 2 midterms, a paper, and a final. i have friends with other gvpt100 teachers and they either had one less exam or their paper was the final",1924
pernick,3,A,SOCY100,"Professor Pernick is a very nice older man who clearly is very passionate about Sociology.  He knows what he is talking about and has background experience in business, which allows him to bring an interesting perspective to the topic.  While he is excited about Sociology and has interesting examples and video clips that relate, he is not the greatest teacher.  His lectures are pretty boring and tend to be straight from the textbook.  We had three graded papers (1-2 pages), a group term paper, and midterm and final exams.  He grades the independent papers very easily.  I have yet to finish the group term paper but I can tell you that planning for it has been a nightmare.  His midterm was very, very difficult and terribly organized, but he realized this and curved our scores significantly afterwards.  His classes are easy to skip because we have so few assignments and you can get by with reading the chapters he goes over in class.  Hopefully an easy A for me.  Overall, he is an approachable, adorable man, but not the greatest Sociology teacher.",1925
pernick,5,A,SOCY100,"If you want an easy A take him. 60% of my grade was from easy online homework through Revel, 15% included beginning of the class quizzes that are extremely easy, and the last 25% you had the option of taking a final or doing a group project/ presentation. He is very sweet and kind. I went to his office hours and he always gave interesting and helpful information about the class. Lectures are boring, but participation mattered so I went almost every class. ",1925
hamill,4,B+,CCJS230,"Hamill is awesome, and he is very passionate about what he does. The layout of the class, however, is somewhat of a pain. The ""one class a week, for two and a half hours of constant talking and no powerpoint or videos"" thing requires a lot of of patience and focus. Lecture is therefore obviously long, but Hamill is not nearly as bad as everyone else seems to make him out to be.",1926
hamill,2,A+,CCJS230,"If you want to hear stories about being a cop and not learn about criminal law, take this class. Hamill ""teaches"" by assigning weekly papers on famous SCOTUS cases and then doesn't really discuss them in class. The 2.5 hour lecture is usually pretty brutal, as he likes to spend time letting the dumbest people in the class give their opinions about various things. Attending class is necessary though because he changes the syllabus constantly, due dates and exams included. He also doesn't use ELMS. We wrote 5 papers and took a midterm before a single grade for the class was posted. All things considered, the class is pretty easy. I don't think he even reads the papers, so if you turn them in you'll automatically do okay. The exams are unnecessarily tricky though because Hamill is a cop AND a lawyer. 

Take this class if you dare.Hamill is the lesser of two evils for professors. Definitely didn't have a great experience, but there's no way he could be more terrible than Dr. White. ",1926
hamill,5,B,CCJS230,"Hamil is a fun. He is a police officer that actually tells real life stories from his expereinces. Does he venture of from the topic, YES. However, he doesnt test us on info that he hasnt himself went over. At the end of class right before a test, he will give us a quick list of what to study. You turn in the assignments and its an easy B. My biggest issue was with how long the class was, but thats not his fault.",1926
hamill,3,A-,CCJS230,"I didn't like this class as much as I thought I would. Hamill was an engaging lecturer but I sometimes felt that he kept us there longer than necessary (he once kept us for the entire 2 hours, 45 minutes without a break...torture). His tests get progressively more difficult (the final was a lot harder than expected-then again, I didn't read the book thoroughly). I also felt like the test questions were worded awkwardly. Overall, it was an easy class but that doesn't mean you don't have to study-I came pretty close to a B.",1926
hamill,4,A,CCJS230,"I recommend this class but prepare yourself cuz it is LONG.  Almost 3 hours but he does keep you interested and engaged.  Hamill is a police officer so he supplments giving you information with cop stories and personal experienes which can drag on but I guess he needs them to fill in the time.  Honestly he tells you exactly what to write down and what you need for the exams, but don't make the mistake of thinking the first exam will be easy!  I did and only got an 84, but the second one I studied a lot on and got a 98 on it.

Basically the info is common sense, and if you pay attention and come to class you'll be fine.  I didn't buy the textbook cuz it was $80 which is ridiculous, and honestly you don't need it.  I got the PDF of book from a classmate for second exam and just read it to supplement my knowledge, but don't buy book; see if someone will loan it to you.

You have to write a paper for almost every week but it's easy as cake. Then two different papers about either a ride-along or a court case, and that's all there is.

Go to class-- he gives out ""quizzes"" that if you're there for he'll bump you up a letter grade if you're close at the end of the semester.

I recommend this course and this prof.",1926
hamill,5,A-,CCJS230,"Coolest professor ever.

Yes, the lecture is long. No, it doesn't feel that way. Professor Hamill does an excellent job of keeping you engaged for the whole lecture period, and lets you get dinner about halfway through. He doesn't use powerpoints which I think is great, since it forces him to ""illustrate"" any topics in the course by telling us stories. He's a 28-year veteran of the Montgomery County Police, so he's definitely seen it all and then some. He's accommodating and genuinely seems to care about us.

The course isn't too hard. There are a few case briefs which are 5 points each and two independent studies. You can either do a police ride along, a court visit or a prison visit. You then write a paper talking about your experiences, 15 points each. Very easy 15 points. The exams were the only tough part of this class, largely because of the tricky wording the questions use sometimes. I loved taking this class and highly recommend it to anyone who's also taken CCJS100 and 105.",1926
hamill,5,A,CCJS230,"Hamill is GREAT!  I actually really look forward to this class every week.  He always has great stories and the class is very interesting.  Even though it's long, the time flies by and he gives you a 15 min break in the middle of every class.  He's also very accommodating and does everything he can to help you. 

The multiple choice tests are pretty easy and as long as you do the case briefs in the way they tell you, you'll get full credit.

Seriously, this is my FAVORITE class I have taken so far at UMD and Professor Hamill is my favorite professor I've ever had.",1926
hamill,4,B,CCJS230,"This class is really long but it's interesting.

There are case briefs that you have to do each week, which are kind of confusing, but the TA's say that as long as you format it correctly, do it on the right case, don't plagarize, and don't BS it, you'll get A's on them. You need the textbook to do them. 

That being said, this class really depends on your TA.  I had the good TA, who had everything graded the next week and kept our grades updated on a spreadsheet which she brought to class for us to look at, (although, there was never a page on blackboard where we could check our grade).  The other TA graded harshly and was never there so people never knew their grades.

Exams are kind of hard; tricky.  But Hamill is fair and gives a curve to each exam when he finds that he gave a question that not a lot of people got.

While the class is long and at a late hour(nearly 3 hours!) Hamill tells us that we knew it would be long when we signed up for it.  However, class rarely goes to the end, and he gives us a break in the middle to get dinner and we can eat in the classroom.

Hamill tells some interesting stories since he is a cop during the day, and exam questions are based off of his lectures and the reading that parallels his lectures.  

He also gives you two independent study papers to write, and he gives you the time to do it, which is nice.  I went to the courts and did a police ride along.

Take CCJS with Hamill!",1926
hamill,2,,CCJS230,"Easy class. However, my TA never gave us any grades or went to class. I emailed her a lot this semester and she never even responded, so I still don't know how I even did on all the papers. Would be much better if it was on ELMS. Hamill is nice, but would be a lot better if he used a powerpoint or something.

Everyone says it's an interesting class, but I thought it was really boring and too long without a powerpoint.",1926
hamill,5,,CCJS230,"Your grade depends on three 50 question multiple choice exams and weekly homework on either 1-2 case briefs, independent study of the criminal justice system (police ride-a-long, court visit, etc) or a paper on the significance of a case (as stated from other reviewers, you can miss two of the case briefs).  Get homework format/requirements squared away immediately because the syllabus isn't as straightforward as it appears to be.  Also, get your book early because homework is due the second week of class and it comes from cases in the book.  Some exam material will be from the book as well, so read it.  The majority of material comes from voice-based lectures - Hamill explicitly states what will appear on exams as he is lecturing.  There may only be a few lectures worth of material on each exam (our final exam is based on three lectures) because class will invariably be disrupted from snow or some other incident.  Also, there are two ""study days"" where class is cancelled, so there aren't many lectures to attend. It never runs the full three hours, plus you get a decent break in the middle. You have no excuse - go to lecture.   

That being said, I genuinely wanted to attend class every week anyway.  Hamill is the most entertaining professor I've had here at UMD - expect to laugh.  However, he does get quite a lot of information across effectively in few lectures.  I highly recommend Hamill's section of CCJS230. 

Important:  keep track of your own grade because elms was not set up for this class (our semester anyway), and if you have any issues with your grade talk/email to the TA's or Hamill - they will do everything they can to get you the points. ",1926
hamill,5,A,CCJS230,"This is my favorite class. I love it. I actually look forward to going to it -- and I'm the kind of person that always skips class.

Take it.",1926
hamill,5,A,CCJS230,"Easy A. informative. you learn all modern criminal law and the history behind it, but his exams aren't too hard. he gives examples to help you remember the laws. the briefs are easy points as long as you format them correctly and don't forget your UID, plus you get to miss 2.",1926
hamill,5,B,CCJS230,"One of my favorite teachers by far! He has so many great stories to tell that all relate with what we're talking about. He doesn't preach from the textbook which is what I like, if I wanted someone to teach me my textbook that I'm fully capable of reading I'd take a different class. 
Also, as an actual police officer he has real experience in the field, which is cool if that's something you are considering, or even simply considering law school. 

If you have the choice between Hamill and anyone else, it's definitely worth your time to take Hamill's if you can. He's that much better. 

There are case briefs due each week which he gives you an outline of how to do, and they aren't graded too hard, two independent study papers (write about a police ride-along, visit a correctional facility or sit-in on a court case) and then a couple exams and a final. 

The class is almost 3 hours long but he gives a break in the middle, and it only meets once a week, which is definitely worth it. The time will fly listening to him. ",1926
hamill,2,B,CCJS230,"Hamill is overrated. The class is 3 hours long and he spends way too much time telling stories. They can be interesting stories sometimes, but it's not interesting when you have to read the textbook since he couldn't fit all the material into lecture. Also, the TA's are undergrad students who are incompetent when it comes to reading and grading papers, so they give you any grade they feel like making up. Even Hamill said the case briefs are an easy 50 points, but the TA's give out low grades. It would have been helpful if we were actually taught how to properly write a case brief. It was just assumed that we knew how to write one.

Some of the topics in the class were interesting, but sometimes the material was repetitive and so common sense that it seemed made up. Overall, the class wasn't that great. ",1926
hamill,5,A+,CCJS230,"The professor is a currently-serving Law Enforcement Officer with amazing inter-personal and teaching skills.

The class is long and at a late hour, but for good reason. He is an actual cop with an actual job. He tells incredibly hilarious stories and relates much of his course work to his personal experience.

Taking this class will allow you to appreciate Law Enforcement as people on an almost personal basis.

If you take notes on everything in class and attend his classes (why wouldn't you?!), then you WILL pass his class.

You learn A LOT and he makes it FUN. Not much else needed to say other than TAKE THIS CLASS RIGHT NOW!",1926
hamill,5,A,CCJS230,"Great professor, very interesting class. Tells stories pretty much the entire time, and they really help you to remember the concepts when it comes time for the test. You don't need to read the book, but it definitely helps. Weekly case briefs are pretty easy and don't take too much time as long as you don't wait until an hour before class to start them. Great class, I really recommend it.",1926
hamill,5,B+,CCJS230,Lectures are long but he does a great job at keeping the class intrigued. Top 3 professors I have had no doubt. Assignments are easy to get done and lecture is easy to follow. Just take a power nap before every class.,1926
hamill,4,B+,CCJS230,"Hamill is a very interesting dude, in a good way. Though the lectures are long (2.5 hours), he fills in the time with a combination of course material and cop stories. The class before an exam he'll give you strong hints as for what to expect on exams so be sure to pay attention. If you attend lecture, do the easy writing assignments, and study for exams you'll do just fine. Unless you have a crazy good memory, you should at least review your notes prior to taking the exams. The 4/5 stars comes from the numerous mistakes/typos on exams; it's as if he doesn't proof read the exam questions prior to assigning them. This isn't the biggest deal but it's just frustrating when it happen on all the exams. ",1926
hamill,5,,CCJS230,"If you ever had to sign up for a 2 and a half hour course, this would be the one. Hamill is a police chief and a lawyer as well, so he knows what he's talking about. The exams are easy as long as you take notes in lecture and study. There are 4 papers but they're nothing to lose sleep over because the prompts for them are straightforward and they make up a very small part of the grade. Also, I had him online thanks to the covid pandemic and he would almost always let us out of the zoom meetings earlier than 2 and a half hours. He understands us students have 4 other classes and a life outside his class. I'm glad I signed up to take him. Definitely one of the best professors I've had in my college career. ",1926
aruoba,3,A+,ECON325,"Aruoba is clearly knowledable about the topic that he's teaching, but makes the class kind of difficult. Problem sets aren't really a problem, they're pretty easy, and very doable. It's the tests where he really gets you.

The class requires a little bit more math and optimization than a lot of people in ECON are comfortable with, so that's something to watch out for. If you understand the math, you'll probably be fine. I had a 75% average in exams for the semester, and that ended up being an A+. His grading policy is set up so that an average student will come out with a B.",1931
aruoba,4,A,ECON325,"Profesor Aruoba is not an easy Professor by any means. He will make you work for your grade. That said, he curves and the average student walks away with a B. The average on midterm one was 38, on midterm two 36 and the final around a 50 so you can see how large the curve is. He is approachable during office hours and will answer any questions you may have.  Problem sets took time but were graded loosely.  Exams were difficult. You really need to know your stuff or you will get steamrolled. I also found his exams to be too long for the amount of time we had. 

Good professor overall. Very knowledgeable and brings current real world economic events into the classroom. Discussion sections are mandatory but I found them very useful. I just didn't like the fact that we had several discussions that were actual lectures taught by the TA's. 

In a nutshell: tough professor, tough exams, lots of optimization functions, lots of reading plus required articles that the professor provides, very challenging exams and problem sets. Hopefully you will learn. 

The kid that posted a review below and said this class was easy is either a genius or the professor's teaching style has changed dramatically since then.",1931
aruoba,2,,ECON325,"He basically lectures off of his slides and base his exams on the slides/previous exams.  You don't really have to read the book.  His lectures are extremely boring and makes discussion sections mandatory.  Participation and 5 problem sets counts as 15% of your grade.  The problem sets were difficult but as long as you put a decent amount of effort in it, you will receive full credit.  The first exam that we had was extremely unfair because he barely went over the materials so the class average was a 36%..After the first exam, he wrote the next exam and the final similar to exams from previous years...but nonetheless, they were still difficult.  As a result, the averages for the second exam was a 56 and the final was a 52.  The best part about his grading policy is that if you score around average, you will get a B. If you score above average, you will push your grade up to an A-.  That was what happened to me...i got a 47, 70, and 63 for all the exams and received perfect scores on all of my problem sets..I ended up with an A-.  His curve is HUGE!  If you can put up with his boring lectures and challenging exams, you should consider taking this class.


",1931
aruoba,4,A+,ECON325,"Class was really easy.  You could probably not go to a single class and get an A if you understand the models.  Lectures can be sleepy at times, but Aruoba really does know what he's talking about.

Homework sets optional and generally easy.

Course requires some basic algebra and partial differentiation - we used the same math for each derivation but some people still didn't get it, which really hurt their test scores.  If you get the math, you should get an A.",1931
madhavan,1,A-,AASP189I,The previous negative reviews are completely right! She is the worst professor I have ever had for a GenEd. She was not clear for what she specifically wanted for each part of the project and then graded very harshly. Our rough draft papers grade average was a 11/20. Which is incredibly low. I would not take her again. ,1935
madhavan,1,,AASP189I,"I actually made a account just to warn you, DO NOT TAKE HER. 
Unless you're an African American Studies she's going to screw you. Things like other classes, time constraints, etc don't matter to her, 30+ pages of reading, weekly paper, and a vague term project that she didn't really know what she wanted. 

She's under the impression that no-one takes classes to fill up electives/requirements, and anyone who signed up has a fervent interest in this and gives you shit if you don't.

TLDR: Bad professor, harsh grader, 9am  class that takes attendance. ",1935
madhavan,1,,AASP398D,"In my experience, Sangeetha Madhavan is the worst professor at UMD. I'm honestly surprised she's rated 2 stars on here, that's a little too high. I agree with the lower rated reviews here, she plays serious favorites and makes no apologies for it.

She's extremely rude and disrespectful. In my 4 years here at Maryland, she was overwhelmingly the worst part about my time at this school. I had the displeasure of having her for 2 classes (forced to due to scheduling around my full time job) so I've seen the best and worst parts of her.

Her goal isn't to make the material enjoyable to learn. It's more of a brute force, curt, and strict ""teaching"" style. She thinks that the only thing students have to worry about is her class so it's fair to expect all Ph.D. level students that learn everything on their own by reading 100s of long JSTOR research papers. If you don't agree with her, she will not be a nice person to you. She will call you out and embarrass you in class making things very awkward. She made my life in her class an absolute hell.

She doesn't understand that people have different learning styles. Personally, I did not learn anything from her. Her rudeness along with her ""teaching"" style turned me completely off. She needs to realize that we are not one size fits all. You know how some professors just have ""it"" and they can make the driest subjects the most riveting and interesting? They treat you with respect and are actually fair in their grading. Well this is absolutely not Sangeetha Madhavan. She's the complete opposite of a good professor.

Her militant views on treating students is very outdated. She needs to be flexible, we are not all trying to get a Ph.D. In fact, we are all humans that have other classes, other real life problems, jobs, and the world does not revolve around her pointless class. She needs to stop being an a-hole to students that are not her favorite.

My advice if you have to have her like I did and can't avoid it: try to be one of her favorites. Kiss up, do whatever. But still do your best to avoid if you can. I don't know what it's like to be her favorite but I'll assume her treatment of you isn't any worse than if she hates you.

On a lighter note: the rest of the African American studies department are awesome. Just really great group of professors and lecturers. Seriously everyone is amazing except for Sangeetha Madhavan, who is the worst. I wish she would leave the department and go to Rutgers.
",1935
madhavan,4,A,AASP189I,"I am an engineering major who took AASP189I as a Gen-Ed elective, and came out of it more interested in the topic and more engaged by the course than I expected to be. I would say I agree to limited extent with the below reviews on a few points: 

1) She is a serious teacher, in that she cares a lot about the subject and expects students to care too. She is not averse to putting students on the spot (though she will call on others if a student is truly stumped). 

In that vein, she assigns decent amounts of reading, even to this Honors Seminar class. We had a 15 page paper culminating a community project, and about 25 pages of reading per week. The first assignment she hits you with a 34 page paper by Dr. Sangaramoorthy (also in the AASP department), I think to get everyone into the flow of things and/or scared of the work to come. That being said, the material is usually not too difficult conceptually, and the first week's piece is the toughest you'll probably face. 

2) I think she does play favorites to a limited extent (and I say that as someone who probably benefitted from that tendency). If you speak more in class, and if you raise cogent points, she is more likely to look upon your work a little more favorably. 

Again, though, this is not some huge thing as far as I can tell; I am merely speculating that my grade might have benefitted a point or two here and there from the benefit of the doubt. 

I did not notice what below reviews described as 'disrespectful,' 'rude,' or 'demeaning' behavior. While I happened to agree with her on most points, I think that either she read the below reviews, or took a slight edge off, or was more relaxed with the Honors Seminar (or what have you), because while she freely challenged what students would say, she never did so in a blatant ""You are wrong,"" or ""What?"" kind of way. She would bridge to something else and tie in a reason adding nuance to or perhaps contradicting the point, but not disrespectfully. 

In summation: 

Work is moderate (some of the readings are dry), but not too bad: 

Weekly readings (3) with summation,
Project w/Paper (15 Pages), and
Mid-term/Final [my year made a big open-source Google Doc reviewing everything and it worked well].

Course is more interesting than (I) expected, and Prof. Madhavan is in my opinion not what the below reviews make her out to be. For three Gen-Ed's especially, this class is well worth it. ",1935
madhavan,4,A,AASP398D,"She's tough- like, look up the definition of a 'tough professor' in the dictionary, and you find a picture of Madhavan. However, she's not pointlessly mean, or unjustly difficult, and she doesn't assign a large workload (it's substantial) just to spite her students. She wants you to learn- that's the bottom line. In other classes, if you slack off/come to class late/ forget to hand things in on time, it's not a big deal. The thing with Madhavan is that, because she is so enthusiastic about these topics, if a student doesn't share her passion (and work to show it), she can come off a bit harsh. If you really want to learn about African Development, and are willing to put in the work, this is the prof for you. Lectures are great, guest speakers are great, structure of classes works really well.",1935
madhavan,1,C,AASP398D,Sangeetha Madhaven is a rude person who likes to demean her students. She picks on people and definitely makes her opinion known. It's her way or the highway.

I was absent once and I sent my classmates and email to make sure there wasn't anything to turn in that following week. She sent me a nasty email that discouraged me from writing to my classmates again. Instead she wanted me to read the slides which never ever mentioned materials we needed to turn in. She bully's students into participating even when it is clear that they don't understand or haven't read the material. She does it with a smile. She is a very hard grader and shows a lot of favoritism. I understand that by writing this I am risking my grade because it is easy to to see who I am from this review but I honestly feel like she should learn to be nicer. Education is not a field you get in to make people feel like idiots.,1935

madhavan,1,,,She is not a good teacher. She treated the class like it was a graduate class. She gave a 20 page term paper and a final that consisted of 20 short answer and 2 essays. She is very hard to please and expects everyone to care about Africa as much as she does. She does not make anything easy so if you want a challenge then take her class. You will regret it tho.,1935
madhavan,4,B,AASP400,"I am shocked to see such low reviews, but not too shocked as Prof Madhavan isn't any easy professor. She is really nice if you come to class and do your work. To me she was not all that hard, we had a short paper every other week. I didn't think she played favorites, but come to think of it she did show attitude to a student that was always late and disagreed with her a lot. She encourages you to think harder and more critically. I just did exactly what was on the syllabus and got an A on most the papers. The students each taught 2 classes each so it was hardly boring, mostly discussion, although some people may not like the heavy African reading (vs AfricanAmerican), and they are not books that you'd be familiar with, like the other profs who do AASP400or402 do. Still, good reading. She does that b/c she clearly loves Africa. Don't take the class if you aren't going to work a little. Not an easy A but you definitely within reach, and will get a new perspective on Africa and gain a lot of knowledge. I would be getting an A but I screwed up something in the end. Luckily I could care less about grades.",1935

Avoid this class like the plague if you are not GOV major.  ",1936
croco,2,,GVPT100,"I learned a lot in this class... but it was an awful experience. Despite being a 100 level class, it is very difficult. Much harder than it needs to be.

The homework assignments are VERY time consuming and extremely difficult. However, you must do well on them if you want a good grade.

The exams are not bad. Make sure you understand things conceptually and you will do fine on them.

Definitely do not recommend this class unless you need to take it.",1936
croco,4,A,GVPT100,"Professor Croco is a good professor. GVPT100 is a terrible class. Croco goes over the essential concepts in lecture multiple times, so it's easy to figure out what's important and what will be on the exams. She also encourages students to ask questions in lecture, which was really helpful. She speaks very fast and only focussed on one of the two projector screens in a fairly large room, so that was annoying. Overall though, I thought she was good and I actually learned from her.

Do not take GVPT100 if you are not a gov major. And if you are, then make sure you do every hw assignment and get a good grade on it, even if you don't understand it. This is basically a gov stat class, so be prepared for that. Also, ask a lot of questions because everything builds on what you learned previously.",1936
croco,5,,,"This class is probably one of the best I've taken at UMD. There is a large amount of reading every class (usually 30+ pages), but the reading guides Prof. Croco puts online are helpful for getting through them. The readings themselves are very interesting and cover a lot of international security topics, and we spend a good amount of time in class discussing the material.

Definitely a class for people looking to learn a bit more about the research component of political science, and for getting into heated debates about a variety of issues.",1936
croco,5,,GVPT201,"A loud and fun personality in the classroom.  GVPT 201 is a dreadful course but if you need to take it, she's the professor you want.",1936
croco,5,A+,GVPT201,"Dr. Croco helped enliven an otherwise (kinda) boring stats class. It was a requirement for me (GVPT major). 
I had never taken a stats nor programming course before, so I knew it was going to be interesting. There are several (~11) coding HW assignments throughout the semester, but the coding wkbk kind of *gives* you the code to rework. Yes, it’s time-consuming, but it’s a lot easier once you get into a habit.
Make sure to read the chapter in the textbook *before* lecture, otherwise you’ll fall behind quickly.
I also found it easy to schedule office hrs with my TA to discuss some minor coding stuff, and stop by Dr. Croco’s during open office hrs to ask questions.",1936
croco,5,B-,GVPT201,"Words cannot express how much this course ruined my semester.  BUT Croco is awesome and keeps the lectures very entertaining.  She is a great prof, but your TA's run the show.  They're the ones grading your assignments and teaching you the detailed stuff.  Exams are no joke.",1936
croco,3,A-,GVPT201,This class is not fun but Professor Croco is so entertaining. It's essentially a statistics and coding class. Not sure why it's labeled a gov class. Glad I'm done with it. ,1936
croco,5,A,GVPT309C,"I love Professor Croco. She's so entertaining, and can make any difficult topic much more fun. Super reasonable and predictable work load in my opinion, and no midterm or final exam for this class! ",1936
kastner,4,A,GVPT200,"Not the most engaging class, since it's all about basic international political relations, but Dr. Kastner does an excellent job of making sure everyone understands the concepts. Even in a 150+ person lecture, he tries to engage his students by asking questions and calling on students to answer. I must admit, I didn't go to all the lectures because once we learned a theory or concept, that was about all he went over for the next couple lectures, just to ensure everyone understood it, but his PowerPoints are very informative and he posts them regularly. ",1939
kastner,4,A,GVPT200,"I really liked Kastner's class; it wasn't the most interesting thing in the world because it's a survey class and didn't get into much depth in anything, but it was fairly enjoyable. He's also really helpful in office hours if there's something you need help understanding or just want to discuss further.

And if you have any choice in your TA's, David Prina's awesome!",1939
kastner,5,B+,GVPT200,"I actually love this class. I feel bad when I miss it. It is really interesting (well, some topics). I would say this class is kind of like intensifying your common sense. Most of the topics are pretty simple and the readings are really not that bad. Some of them are pretty long, but I usually go over them briefly and then search for topics that were talked about in class. Discussion is worth 20% of your grade, so you should definitely go and you actually have to participate to get full credit. Definitely do the readings before-hand. Otherwise, the structure of the class is 15%- First Exam, 15%- Second Exam, 20% 4-5 Page Paper with a choice of a few topics, and a 30% final exam. Don't wait until the last minute to study for the exam though, because it's a lot of information sometimes. In addition, he posts the lecture slides on ELMS, but he really expands on his points and gives many examples in class that help on the exams so I would encourage everyone to go. Also, this semester, every TA got to lead a lecture, which is sometimes nice but a few are pretty poorly done. Overall, Kastner is a really nice guy, he really cares about his students and always willingly answers questions. I would definitely rank him as one of the top professors I've had. ",1939
kastner,4,A,GVPT409Q,"I really enjoyed this class.  Professor Kastner is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject.  There is a sufficient amount of reading, and class participation is important (I believe its 25% of the grade), but he is a fairly easy grader and an overall nice guy.  If you are interested in international relations and don't mind really getting into the specifics of this topic, then I would highly recommend the class. If you put in the effort, do the work, and participate in class, it shouldn't be difficult to get an A.

There are usually 4-5 readings a week, each reading anywhere form 10 to 40ish pages. Sometimes the readings can be a little tedious but most are pretty interesting and you almost always discuss them in class.  There is a midterm, final, and term paper.  He basically gives away the main topics for each exam - like i said, if you do the work, this class isn't difficult.  The paper is really open-ended, you can write about whatever you want pertaining to the main topic.  He is more than willing to help you with your topic or the paper in general.

Overall, I would recommend this class and this professor. ",1939
kastner,2,A,GVPT200,"The class is very easy, but Kastner is not a good lecturer. He essentially reads the powerpoint and lectures as if he is reciting a speech. However, the class itself is very easy. 

If you get to choose your TA though, Nathan Grossman was phenomenal. I never went to lecture but I never missed a discussion! ",1939
kastner,4,A,GVPT200,"Professor Kastner was great. Sure, he's not the greatest lecturer, but they aren't so dull that you'll dread going. And he posts them all on elms, so if you decide to miss one or two, you're still fine. He is very understanding; I had surgery this semester and had to miss 3 weeks of school around midterms. He gave me as much time as I needed to make up the test and the paper we'd had due earlier. 
There are two papers in here and two tests, the midterm and the final.",1939
kastner,3,B,GVPT200,"nice enough guy but not the greatest lecturer. Class is easy, 2 tests and a paper. However avoid the TA Tara like the plague. She is no help whatsoever in discussion. Does not seem to care about how her students do. Plus she is a very, very hard grader. If you have the opportunity to switch to a different section do it, you will not regret it.",1939
kastner,4,B,GVPT409E,"I took East Asian Relations with Dr. Kastner for the Spring 2018 semester. The class focused mainly on China (which is his field of specialty, I am assuming), which was fine but it would have been nice if we focused more on the other countries in the region (although we briefly spoke about Japan and their relations with China, and North Korea). Most topics we discussed were either on China, issues related to China, or China's relations with a neighboring country.

Dr. Kastner is a fair grader and pretty helpful if you have questions. I had questions about the final presentation and he pointed me to several resources for my topic specifically. I also had to email him about an issue with a groupmate for a group project and thankfully he was very understanding. Personally I hate group projects, however he gave us a lot of time to complete the project and even gave us class time to work on the project, as well.

I appreciate that he put up the powerpoint slides online before each class and also gave us a short 10-15 minute break during class since the class was 2 hours and 45 minutes long.",1939
kastner,5,A+,GVPT409E,I took GVPT409E East Asian Politics with Kastner and he was an excellent professor. He is very knowledge and passionate about the Asian region and it shows through his lectures. Kastner is also really understanding. Fairly easy course if you come to class prepared by doing readings/participating. I worked hard on the major assignments and got an A.,1939
kastner,5,A+,GVPT289J,"Prof Kastner is really knowledgeable about the East Asia region and it showed through his lectures. I appreciated the way in which he took the time to answer students' questions to the best of his ability, and he did a good job explaining more complex topics. There were about 3 major essays which were fairly open-ended and easy to respond if you listened in lecture.",1939
kastner,5,A,GVPT289J,"Professor Kastner is a really knowledgeable lecturer on East Asian politics. If you take GVPT289J you probably have some sort of interest in the inner workings of China overall, and Kastner does his best to quench your thirst through curated PowerPoints on major topics such as economy and cultural explanations of China's role in past and current events. The course grades are primarily divided into three major essay assignments, about 4 pages each, that ask you to explain the US-China relations in different fields. Attending the lectures should be enough to give you all the information that you need. Overall I think it was a very entertaining class with just the right amount of difficulty for an elective.",1939
kastner,5,,GVPT204,"GVPT204 is the new classification for what was once called 289J. As for the class, Kastner did a great job teaching it. His lectures are great and you should go to them since the slides on elms are vague. He really goes in depth about them. Gradewise, there were 3 papers, each worth 25% of your grade and I found the prompts straightforward. The remaining 25% was participation in discussion. As long as you are involved and talking, you should be fine. We had to be discussion leaders at one point in the semester and pose questions based on readings and lectures to the class. Overall, great class and great professor. You should take this class if you ever get the chance.",1939
urzua,3,B+,ECON423,"Econ 423 is HARD. Urzua is good at making the class worthwhile. He's less about the math, and more about the economic reasoning.

Exams (3 Midterms and one cumulative Final) are difficult. Each builds on the last. Expect repeat questions, so take the time to learn from your previous mistakes. 

Problem sets (4 total) are also hard. Each takes at least 10 hours. Very STATA-heavy, so expect to be thrown into STATA with absolutely zero class time taken to explain the basics.

Curves to a B/B+, depends on the class size.",1942
urzua,3,B+,ECON423,"I learned a lot from Dr. Urzua, but he tries to cover too much material in a class. Many of the concepts he teaches branches into graduate-level economics, and having that knowledge will give you a leg up for internships/jobs as research assistants or junior economists. As a result, many of the concepts are taught in a rushed manner. If you don't stay on top of your work, you can easily fall behind in class.

His problem sets take on average 10-14 hours to complete, and the knowledge needed to complete the questions aren't explicitly covered in his lecture. His exams are notoriously difficult and tend to have class averages between 20% and 55%. His lectures are almost completely oral with occasional writing on the board to write the occasional equation or regression. His office hours aren't too helpful since he tends to be very vague with his answers.

The class involves a lot of independent studying and will allow you to have a more thorough understanding of the concepts. Don't take this class if your schedule is pushing anywhere more than 16 credits.",1942
urzua,3,B,ECON423,"Left this review on rate my professor as well: He is very accessible and really wants his students to succeed. This course was extremely challenging and needed a lot of time dedicated to it. COVID updates to his normal syllabus: No final, dropped lowest midterm, and several quizzes. He curved to a B (I think he did this in normal semesters). Very knowledgeable and passionate about economics.",1942
harley,5,A,AASP202,I loved this class. Yes you HAVE to go to lecture but its totally worth it...There is alot of material but Prof. Harley makes it very easy to follow and understand...My T.A. was pretty helpful but then again I only needed his help once...The workload is pretty decent for the amount of material you actually learn....TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. HARLEY!!! She's the best!,1944
harley,3,A,AASP202,"Class focused on black culture in post-emancipation era, Harlem Renaissance,black arts movement, and hip hop. Going to lecture is a MUST because she gives A LOT of notes that are not online. Like most African American studies class, there is a lot of reading.  The quizzes are True/False and they are pretty fair.  She gives a mid-term exam and a final exam that covers a lot of material. And there is also a  6-7 page mid-term paper. Harley  makes lecture a little interesting sometimes by throwing in some of her personal stories and jokes.  However, her TA's are not very helpful.   ",1944

If you reach out to her she’s either not going to respond to your email or she’ll reply with something that doesn’t help (in reference to grades) GSS sessions barely help. It’s like she purposely makes the exams so difficult for what reason I dont know. I would’ve been able to get by with at least a C if the exams weren’t rigorous and if we had longer than one hour. All in all, it didnt seem like she cared much. Even when other students would ask questions during zoom calls.",1948
scandizzo,4,A,ECON200,"People exaggerate the difficulty of this class. With that being said it is a 200 level class, not a 100 level. Overall exams are not too bad if you actually study.

Definitely a good course but I know a lot of kids complained about the pace of it, which I thought was pretty decent for a freshman taking a first-time college course; you teach yourself the content with the online textbook and then she goes over it in class to really get in your head which I liked; would reccommend!",1948
scandizzo,2,A-,ECON200,"I want to cut her some slack because it's her first semester dealing with this many students and having it online doesn't make it easy, but she was very ineffective as a teacher this semester and at least some of that is due to the online nature of the class to be fair. Do the readings and study them hard if you haven't taken micro before and you'll be fine, but I know I'm only doing well right now because I took Econ in high school.",1948
scandizzo,4,A+,ECON200,Tests are very fair and you don't have to do much studying. Just to the homeworks and the smartbook assignments and you're good. You don't really have to pay attention to the lectures most of the content can be self learned. She knows what's she's talking about but gets kinda annoyed if you ask obvious questions.,1948

Econ is hard what other times do we have to ask questions if she doesn’t respond to emails? The pace wasn’t the issue the lack of assistance, help, matching test questions was the issue. Homeworks and smart books were annoying but do-able....Exams were a entire different thing. She could improve a lot of ways for the next round of students.",1948
scandizzo,4,A+,ECON200,"Assigns 1-2 textbook chapters every week. Chapters are not long,  each one takes like 1 hour to finish if you read thoroughly. She goes over the material from the readings in class and records them. 

HW consists of Connect and Smartbook questions. Smartbook is a bunch of multiple choice questions based on the reading, but it's basically completion cause the questions are easy and you can get a bunch wrong and still get full credit. Connect questions are like problem sets, which can take a little while to finish and can get tricky, but prof drops lowest two connect and smartbook assignments, and you get 2 submissions per assignment, so there's some leeway if you mess up. 

In class quizzes are assigned every week, but you get 2 attempts per quiz and prof gives you a chance to talk in groups about the quiz after the first attempt. 

Exams are all multiple choice. If you don't know the material well then you're fffffffucked, but all you gotta do is study well, go to GSS, and go over past HW's and most importantly understand the material and you'll easily get a B+ or above every time. 

To be honest, contrary to my peers, I really liked the class. If you're good at teaching yourself, you like economics, and you have an interest towards the subject, you will most likely get an A and learn a good amount. However, I can't say much about the professors teaching abilities because I mostly learned from the readings and HW assignments. You'll probably eat shit if you're looking for a loaf class and/or you rely on the professor to teach you most of the info.

Overall the class is fairly easy if you put in the work you're supposed to. I was lucky and had a background in microeconomics before taking it so most things were not new to me. She understands what she's talking about but the execution of her teaching style did not always go well with students. It was her first time teaching such a large lecture AND it was online so got to cut her some slack there. ,1948
scandizzo,3,A,ECON200,"(I took this class completely online.) This was a surprisingly difficult class for me. I put in a considerable amount of effort (significantly more than I've needed to get an A in most of my other classes so far) and still struggled to get the A. The pace of the class is quick–not unmanageable, but still quick. I also found the exams to be MUCH harder than the homeworks and review materials. From what I heard from my classmates, some people thought the exams were very unfair and some thought they were fine. As someone with no econ background but who genuinely put in a lot of effort, studied a lot, kept up with the material, etc, I'd say the exams are pretty hard but not impossible.

He crams a lot of info into the few short weeks you have in summer school, and while you might gloss over some of the hairy details you still get the good stuff.

Homework is very easy, he grades it based on completion not accuracy. We had one exam which made up 60% of our grade but it was very easy. Honestly, just go to class, do the homework and read the OJ Simpson Issues and you'll be fine. If you get less than an A, you didn't try hard.

Take good notes and actually go to class (or get someone elses notes) and youll be alright (tip - when you get to stuff like z-tests and t-tests, spend like a half hour and learn how to make the calculator do them for you, itll save you a lot of time and calculation mistakes) 

The homework is a pain in the ass, but it's not terribly difficult, just long. Just set aside like 2 hours each week and crank it out, its doable. The lab videos are absolutely pointless, I'd usually just mute them and have them running in the background while I did other things, and then watched the 10 seconds pertinent to the question that was asked. 

There is a final paper, again not terribly taxing, just a pain to write. That's basically this whole class in a nutshell. Easy enough, just a pain at times.  ",1959
tomlinson,3,,PSYC200,"Here's the thing with this class. If you're good at math, it is going to be pretty easy. If you aren't, you're going to have to try a bit. The material isn't terrible and Tracy does make it more interesting than it could be (I can't imagine this class with a boring, droning teacher). If you aren't lazy, and you're not good at math, there are lots of opportunities to boost your grade (participation points, a final paper).

The homework is not pleasant. There is a lot on Aplia and the setting she has it on is kind of harsh (you get 3 tries on each problem, and if you don't get it totally right the first time you can never get full credit on that problem).

The tests are open note/book. 


PS: if Kapil is your TA, be happy. He's a life saver.",1959
tomlinson,4,A+,," Dr. Tomlinson is a really good teacher, she gets into the material and involves the class. She does a good job of answering any questions that anyone has. The way she presents the material makes it very easy to understand.
However, she assigns homework on the material but often times it is due before the lecture on it is given. The textbook is fairly good, but some of the topics didn't really make sense until we discussed them in class, so it would have been beneficial to have the lecture before the homework was due, so that the practice could solidify the knowledge rather than just confuse the students. 
The topics in this class weren't hard, it was just a ridiculous amount of work to do, which adds up even if you don't have to try too hard on it. You also have to attend every lecture for full participation points, which isn't always possible and shouldn't happen in a college course.
The lab videos you have to watch every week are a pain too, because unless you watch it straight through without skipping around or pausing, you won't get credit for it. It's nice that the discussion/lab isn't mandatory, but the videos are still obnoxious. 
She also forbids you from using computers, which I feel shouldn't happen in a college course. I study and learn best when I take notes on the computer, so having to write everything by hand was obnoxious and the fact that I didn't have a choice in it was annoying in and of itself.
The tests are very easy and they are open note, and she also provides extra credit, so it's not hard to get a good grade. It's just an obnoxious class to take because she treats students like they are highschoolers. ",1959
tomlinson,2,,PSYC200,"She gives way too much homework. Between videos and aplia it was hard to keep up. Additionally, she does aplia as an average of your best scores instead of taking your best try, which really hurt my grade considering homework was 40% of our grade.  The way she takes attendance is ridiculous. You should not have to do clickers, and write out on half sheets. Although I think she would be a good teacher for someone who is naturally good at math, it was a really tough class for me. I also think she was very condescending at times. Her  TA's also seemed very ill-informed. ",1959

tomlinson,3,B,PSYC200,"Dr. Tomlinson was nice and approachable and extremely passionate about statistics. However, I felt she often got caught up in answering questions or going through each tiny step of a problem, rather than addressing larger concerns.
The homework was okay, though time intensive. The lab videos were AWFUL. They took forever to watch and the questions were often vague or relied on information from earlier in the video, so I would suggest writing EVERYTHING down. Both homework and lab videos are required. 
There were also half-sheets that had to be completed in class that I felt offered no real value to the students, but attendance to all lectures was necessary for full participation points. 
The TA's were very helpful to me because they offered review sheets for the test, but I found the class to be a lot of work for very little outcome. 
A ""B"" is not typical of my performance in my classes, and I think it goes to show that the tests are not reflective of the lectures, despite being open note.",1959
tomlinson,4,A,PSYC200,"Dr. Tomlinson was nice, helpful, and very clear in her lectures. I'd taken AP Stat before so I knew much of the content, but she still explains things pretty effectively.

tomlinson,4,A,PSYC200,"write everything on the homeworks, dont skip ANYTHING (especially how you calculate mean. its ridiculous but you actually have to write out, 2+2+2=6. 6/3=2. Mean=2). tests were open notes and very similar to the homeworks. I had Mark as my TA in discussion, HE IS AWESOME. he went through problems very similar to the homework problems which was very helpful. he is also really funny. homework is due every tuesday except for test weeks. 

lecture is incredibly boring, i read TFLN the entire time. you have to attend lecture bc attendance is taken in the form of clickers or hand written half-sheets of paper. easy A class with some effort. 

1 statistical analysis paper due at the end of the semester. not impossible, just annoying. ",1959
tomlinson,5,,PSYC309K,Best Psychology teacher I've had! Her forensic psychology class is very interesting and mostly discussion based so as long as you do the assignments and come to class it's pretty easy to get an A. She is very fair and receptive of students needs as long as you are willing to communicate with her. Overall great class and great teacher,1959
tomlinson,2,,PSYC200,"Dr.Tomlinson didn't bother me initially until midway through the semester. I asked her a question on an exam because the wording of it was confusing, & she responded very rudely with ""Do what it says."" as if that clarifies or helps me at all? Then on the the paper the first thing that's due she said was to write a rough draft, assuming that was literally a rough draft I wrote the 5-8 pg paper as a rough draft..then the TA emailed everyone the night before it was due to write a 3 pg methodological review & summary..when I emailed to get clarification, nobody clarified. If I had not taken AP Statistics in high school I would be completely lost in this class because Dr.Tomlinson can't teach well at all & makes you do ridiculous examples that don't make sense with the material being taught. She also holds you over class with snarky remarks that she still has 3 more minutes. Don't take this class with her, take this class with the other guy that teaches it he seems really nice & helpful UNLIKE her.",1959
tomlinson,5,A,PSYC200,"Best math teacher I've ever had in my life. She truly cares about her students and wants to help. She asks often if she's doing a good job and has students review her class at different points. Sometimes she goes over things too quickly but as long as someone asks her to slow down or repeat things she has absolutely no problem with it. She is always willing to meet with students to help as well. 8am SUCKS. It gets very hard to pay attention and stay awake in a stat class that early but Tracy does the best she can with it. The discussion board is always open online for questions and Tracy or a TA gets back to students within a few hours at the most. She's very enthusiastic and ALWAYS wears black. LOTS of homework, exams are pretty tough, but if you have to take this class she's definitely the one to take it with.",1959
tomlinson,2,B+,PSYC440,"Horrible teacher!!! She does not care about her students. I would not recommend this teacher. You can get a good grade, but there is a lot of work for this course",1959
tomlinson,5,A,PSYC200,"Course taken Spring 2011 semester. I got an A. I was worried I would get a B, but going to lab discussions and lectures help. Concepts are easy to grasp once you go to lab. Go to lectures; there is a participation grade.

Don't miss any classes because for the people who abhor math, the class is very doable. 

Homework was harder than the exams. The paper wasn't awful. 

The professor loves teaching and always stops to ask questions. Material you need to learn isn't very interesting, but Tomlinson's class makes you understand it well.",1959
tomlinson,3,,PSYC200,"While engaging during the course, her exams were a little ridiculous and she assigns far too much homework. This isn't high school anymore: attendance shouldn't be taken at lecture, only at specialized discussion. I can understand assigning weekly homeworks, but the assignments took hours and were repetitive and tedious: it should be our own responsibility to practice what we learn if we wish to do so. A third of the final exam consisted of 2 types of testing that she spent less than a lecture on, was not gone over in discussion, and we were never asked to know even for a homework assignment.",1959
tomlinson,5,A+,PSYC200,"Prof. Tomlinson is a good teacher but she requires a lot! We had ten homework assignments and they ranged from three to six questions. However, each question has about five parts to it so you can see how they would take a long time. The homeworks aren't hard and if you go to lecture and lab you'll be just fine. I got a 77.5 and a 85 on two homeworks and A's on all the rest and this was done with minimal effort. I basically just looked at the notes while I was doing the homework. Also the book isn't really necessary if you go to lecture BUT it is helpful or clarification. I stopped doing the readings after the first midterm exam and I did fine but I also went to every lecture and lab. I'm not really good at math but her teaching style is extremely helpful if you're like me. If you're good at math this class might be a little boring but then again maybe you just won't go to lecture. There are two exams and a final. The final is cumulative ONLY in the sense that you need to remember some concepts and calculations/formulas. There is also a final paper which SUCKS!!! You have to do a rough draft, a peer review, a response to the peer review and a final draft. The paper is a critique of an article you find and I didnt put much effort into in and got an A overall. 16/20-rough draft, 9.5/10-peer review, 8/10-response, and 59/60-final. Luckily I got a really good peer review which helped my final. The class is long and gets boring at times but is definitely a class I would recommend for people that are worried about their grade. You also have to turn ur hw in before she starts talking in lecture or you'll get points deducted. hope this helps :) My final grade was a 94 but with the extra credit(i did all four) i got a 96.",1959

tomlinson,5,A,PSYC309K,"My favorite class & my favorite teacher! The topics covered in the class are really interesting and Tracy always uses different ways to introduce material.

tomlinson,3,B,PSYC200,Very average professor.  Nothing about her stood out to me except she took attendance 10 times a semester which was a *****.  I would recommend her as a Psyc200 prof as she has great reviews right before the test and posts all powerpoints online.  Makes studying a cinch.,1959
tomlinson,4,A-,PSYC200,"Tracy seems to be a great professor, but the class is just extremely boring (and that's not entirely her fault). The material has very little to do with psychology, and I can't imagine it any different than STAT100 or MATH111. She was very bubbly and a good speaker, but the material just seemed old (I found it to be exactly the same as my high school AP stat class). So if you have to take the class, it won't be awful. The material will just be boring.",1959
tomlinson,1,B,PSYC200,"I am not sure what the other people are talking about.
Tracy Tomlinson is an expremely poor teacher. She is condescending, disrespectful, and unprofessional. She is also unfamiliar with some of the course content, which shows in lecture. The work that she has students do is tedious and unhelpful. The class is more focused on calculations than concepts, and Tracy looks to deduct point wherever she can. She treats her T.A's terribly, and it is clear that they do not like her as well. Lastly, the concepts she teaches are not consistent with other introductory level statistics for psychology classes. She should not teach the class again.",1959
tomlinson,3,B,PSYC200,"very nice professor..really cares about students and wants you to understand. If you don't understand something she will go over it as many times as needed. the course consists of three exams, final paper, and ten homework assignments. the homework assingments are extremely difficult and time consuming. if your not willing to spend an average of 5 hours on each homework you wont finish the assingment. she tends to post problems that she never went over how to do and don't make sense. in lecture she can get confused about what she is saying and is sometimes unclear. But before each exam she post a study guide..i would recommend not studying for the exam until this is posted..her exams are exactlyyyy the study guide..everything she says you need to know will be on it and never tries to trick you..she is extremely fair when it comes in that sense..exams are straightforward..one downfall are the homeworks.",1959
tomlinson,4,A,PSYC200,"Professor Tomlinson is a really great professor. She is extremely helpful and goes over topics more than once. The material in the class is not very difficult if you have taken a statistics class before. There are 3 exams, and she gives a review class. If you study the review you will do well on the test. There is one homework assignment each week, and its pretty tedious, but not very difficult. My only complaint about this class is that she posts the homework late at night, which makes it difficult to complete in time for lab, which is the only opportunity to ask any questions. Instead of having a final you have a final paper, which can be interesting if you choose a good article. The only bad thing is you have to write a paper reviewing someone elses paper and then respond to the person that edits your paper. Overall this class is not that difficult, and Professor Tomlinson is a good teacher.",1959
tomlinson,2,B+,PSYC200,"I did not enjoy Dr. Tomlinson's method of teaching statistics.  She went over a lot of lectures pretty quickly and even if people asked questions, including myself, I felt that I was still left confused because of how fast she goes over the material.  I've taken two statistic courses before this one, so you'd think I'd be able to understand and breeze through this course, too.  Not at all.  If her teaching style was a little different, I might have liked her a little more.  

The work load isn't bad, though.  Homework is pretty stupid because she gives 6 parts for each question (usually 5 or 6), but only 2 questions are graded.  So, yeah, kind of a waste of time for all of that work.  The tests aren't too bad if you know the material; you can have a half sheet with formulas on it.

Her attendance policies are ridiculous and your homework is counted late as soon as she starts talking in lecture on the day it's due... no excuses, even if you're sick.",1959

The material is dry and the course moves so slowly, she spends half the time repeating information from the last class but she doesn't explain things well so it doesn't lead to a better understanding at all. The lab is frustrating, my section stayed the entire 2 hours every time just going over the things we went over twice already in class but other sections were only there for half an hour. The homework assignments are also extremely unclear, especially as it got to the end of the semester, the syllabus was not helpful so it was just having to check ELMS every week to see what was due.

When it comes to her syllabus, yea she may be  off sometimes, but her GA revises the syallbus each semester. If there are any issues, she is willing to move exam dates, etc if it is beneficial for everyone. She was always very friendly with students and everyone I knew loved her course. 

One downfall: she tends to go through slides fairly quickly and doesn't post them online. But she tells you exactly what you need, so its not the biggest deal on earth unless you are the students that jots each pointless word/phrase down. 

I really appreciated her as a professor and has been my favorite in all my time here (i'm a senior). She is very open and honest and helps you in any way possible (if you ask). ",2074
tripp,5,A,FMSC487,"I'm honestly surprised to see such horrible reviews on this professor. I am currently a senior at UMD and of my four years at this school believe that Dr. Tripp has been one of my favorite professors. She keeps the class extremely interesting, and allows for lots of discussion. She never imposes her own views when presenting the course material; instead she presents both sides of an argument and then lets the class discuss the topic. I really appreciate this because I feel like so many professors try to persuade students towards their own views/opinions. 

So if you are considering taking this class, I would highly recommend it. As long as you actually show up to class and take notes, it's a pretty easy course. Dr. Tripp tells you exactly which cases/information will be on the exams so you don't have to worry about memorizing tons of irrelevant material. Other than the tests there is one paper (about 5 pages) that is on a book. ",2074
tripp,1,,FMSC487,"She is rude, condescending and bigot. I dropped her class. ",2074
tripp,1,,FMSC487,"She is rude and stuck up. Just like the previous post says, she claims to be open to opinions but she is in fact completely narrow minded and because of this comes off as being ignorant. She thinks her syllabus is like the constitution and has the answers to all the questions a student could ask- FALSE. I couldn't find a video posting and she rudely replied the answer was on the syllabus, which by the way it was not, and then had to end up emailing the entire class to let everyone know where they could find it. Although the cases and readings were extremely interesting, she sabotaged the class with her dictator like lecturing. She always asked for our opinion and then marked us wrong when the opinions did not match historically made decisions, aka her opinions. I remember when I asked her to reconsider my grade for a posting I believed to be extremely well and she replied that ""in law classes, we are really looking for the law--that is the correct answer""...... Well that is fine but do not ask for my opinion and then tell me you were looking for a previously made decision. That day she also insulted some social science/ literature majors claiming that they probably are more tolerant of wrong opinions, but not her law class. (Even though she is teaching a FAMILY law class. The irony in her stuffyness) Dr. Tripp, and she made it clear from the beginning she was a ""Dr"", reminds me of a judge who would be inconsiderate of changing a bad law because it has always been tradition. Oh and she talks down to you as if you are not worthy of her time and will respond to emails in the poorest dictation to prove how much she doesn't care about your inquiry. Anyways, I think you have a good idea of what she is like now. She is extremely bigot and I dropped her class before she could ruin my gpa. ",2074
tripp,1,,FMSC487,"The professor claims to be professional and open to various opinions, but she has tolerance for any opinion that's different than hers. After working really hard throughout the semester, she still refused to give me the grade I deserved because she didn't agree with my opinions. I had a 4.00 GPA, and now because of her all my efforts went down the drain :(",2074
tripp,3,,FMSC382,"Professor Tripp is extremely disorganized. Every single week it was a struggle to figure out what we were supposed to be doing and if we were missing any assignments. The syllabus and ELMS calendar are always wrong, she sends out a ""to do list"" but then the assignments are either locked or don't exist, and it is impossible to tell where any of the materials are. The class is super easy and I did enjoy what I learned, but keeping up with things took a lot of effort. ",2074
mcdaniel,5,A,KNES497,"Personally, I really like Dr. McDaniel and his teaching style. He is a good professor who actually cares about his students doing well and learning the material they need to learn. He is passionate about making his students understand things that we will take with us as we go on in life, like how to critically read a research paper. Dr. McDaniel is not an easy grader and will make you learn and work for your grades but hey isn't that what college is for? I would recommend taking any of his classes and I wish that I had taken others of his. He is one of those professors who is there to help and you won't benefit if you sit back and try to slide through the class. ",2076
mcdaniel,3,B,KNES355,"Sounds like it would be fun but turned out to be one of the hardest classes. McDaniel has no problem failing people and is actually quite mean. Plus there are just mass amounts of information to study, making the exams difficult.",2076
plotkin,5,B,KNES498T,"Plotkin is a great instructor because he not only teaches you the material that you need to know for this class, but also shares with the students his knowledge from being in the work force as a chiropractor, CSCS, and a few other titles. He teaches the material in a easy going manner and is very personable in terms of approaching him for questions and concerns. I am in his 498T class now and I can definitely say that it is one of if not my favorite class I have taken in the KNES dept. The material is dense and very anatomy based, but you walk out of the class every day knowing you've learned something new that you can use even just in your everyday life. The only draw back of the class is that it is at 8am because he works at his practice afterwards, but the tests and quizzes are all very fair and he has a great teaching style. Great  class!",2078
mokhtari,2,B+,FMSC341,"Probably one of the worst lecturers I've ever had. The course is greatly structured around cengage and the lecture slides are from the same company -- never in his own words or inclusive of anything he rambles on during lecture. He is very incomprehensible and generally a terrible public speaker; the lecture slides tend to be 56 slides, which he only goes over ~20 if you're lucky. He also is very unapproachable outside of class and can never be contacted via ELMS or email. 

For homework, it is weekly and you will have to purchase cengage ($130); the interface itself is also incomprehensible and the syllabus does not specifiy what you are to complete -- it just says assignments, while there are three different assessments on cengage. For this sake, 3/4ths of the class missed four homeworks. When asked, he aggressively avoided the question and said to review the syllabus -- this happened three times during class, it's actually quite scary how combative the classroom was. 

Overall, I would strongly recommend taking another lecturer, but FMSC341 and FMSC290 are only taught by him, so you can't escape any of these experiences. Hopefully these issues will be addressed for future courses, otherwise you will feel just as vulnerable as our class did.",2082
mokhtari,5,C,FMSC341,"Professor Mokhtari is extremely lenient on due dates and grading. At the end of the semester, he changed the due dates to every past assignment to the last day of class so we could go back and increase our grades and turn in anything we hadn't already. My only complaint is that his lectures are very boring and if you ask him a question, he will spend 20 minutes explaining his answer.",2082
mokhtari,5,A+,FMSC341,The best prof at the UMD. Has a great passion for helping  students. Thoughtful and considerate. Responds to emails real fast. A great lecturer. He makes the course easy by being there for you. Assignments and the tests follow the main topics in the course. ,2082
seale,5,B,HLSA710,"Awesome Professor! Dr. Seale is patient, knowledgeable, provides detailed feedback.",2087
smith-bynum,5,A,FMSC330,"Very nice professor and an easy going class. Tests are mostly from power point slides and a little from the book. Other assignments include three short papers. Participation is based on ""clickers"" you use in class which makes getting participation points easy. I would recommend this class.  ",2089
smith-bynum,5,A,HNUH248A,"Easygoing professor and interesting class, would recommend. Minimal coursework for the class too.",2089
fanflik,5,A,,"I took this class summer 2009, as an online class. The material is very easy to get through, and definitely ""A-able.""  Professor Fanflik is a great teacher and very responsive to questions.  Easy grader, not much work.  Very useful powerpoint slides.  Highly recommended teacher.",2097
gentili,5,A+,KNES462,"Gentili is the man.  Personable, funny and french.  This class is very straight forward.  We have class every 2-3 weeks and everything else is done online.  The face-time (in-class) portion of the class is spent reviewing the online lectures and then he quizes us on the review that he just went over.  If you go to those classes and pay even an iota of attention, you will get 10/10 every time.  He cares about his students tremendously.  As he returns quizes and tests in the first 30 minutes of the class, he talks with the student individually explaining what they got wrong, why and how they may be able to study better in the future.  Great freaking class- extremely interesting and class once every 3 weeks!! However, everyone needs to know that Gentili MAKES this class.  Best teacher I've had at UMD",2102
gentili,5,A,KNES462,"Dr. Gentili is one of the best professors I've had in Kinesiology. Very helpful and straight forward. The class is half online and half in person. When you meet up there is a quiz every class but they're easy! Just come to class he gives hints and clues of what's going to be on the quizzes. And his exams are straight forward, his study guides are on point. Not to mention how kind he is, he actually goes over the quizzes and exams with each student explaining how come they got some things incorrect. Overall great class.",2102
gentili,5,A,KNES462,"This teacher is amazing. He is so willing to help his students pass. Pay attention to his lectures because they are clues to what's going to be in his quizzes (on top of studying for it of course). The class is memorization but overall exams, quizzes, and final is STRAIGHT FORWARD. What he gives you in reviews and review slides is what you need to study and WILL expect on the test. As long as you're consistent with the reading you are guaranteed to do absolutely well in the class.",2102
gentili,5,A,KNES462,"Rodolphe is a straight boss. He is very chill and laid back and is always willing to help his students when they have a problem. This class was blended online and is very straight forward. Memorize the slides, Don't miss quizzes. BOOM. you have an A. His accent is cool too.

Take this for an option, you won't regret it.",2102
mower,5,A,KNES289R,"There weren't a lot of reviews for Dr.Mower so I was very hesitant to take this class at first but now I am very glad I did. Dr.Mower is a very engaging professor that will keep you listening the entire class. I am generally someone who does hw in my gen ed classes but I couldn't in this class because I didn't want to miss anything. He is also young and relatable and tries to connect with his students. The class is not very hard but it is essential to go to lecture to be able to write good essays. There were 2 essays, 2 projects and 2 quizzes which isn't bad at all and he's very helpful during office hours if you're having trouble with any of the assignments. Hands down the best class I've taken at UMD so far in terms of the topic and the professor.",2103
lindle,4,A,KNES260,"Easy Class.  She posts the lectures online, and then you just come to class to review them.  There are a few EASY assignments, such as a family health tree, which are mad easy.  Midterm was pretty difficult but it was curved 20 points and the final wasn't too bad.",2104
iso-ahola,4,B+,KNES442,"I definitely recommend taking this class; that being said, there is a significant amount of course work. Do NOT register for this class thinking psychology means easy. The readings, which are certainly interesting, are pretty hefty and not optional. All articles must be read and annotated. Don't fake it: it will come back to bite you on the midterm and final! They are super specific and frustrating, the average being low, but the curve being decent to give 1/2 A's and B's, the other half C's and D's. This is probably the only KNES class with a curve.
Also, register knowing you must participate in class. 25% of your grade is class participation, so don't expect to just sit through class and not contribute.
The paper is not too bad, as long as you figure out what he's looking for. I somehow managed an A, but this was a shock to me. It's very hard to know where you stand in the class",2107
iso-ahola,5,A,HONR258O,"Seppo is the best professor I have had at Maryland. He is fair, and his class is quite entertaining. There is a fairly large packet of readings you need to do throughout the semester, but you also get to spend half of the semester on the driving range learning the game of golf. Seppo greatly improved my game, and is a great instructor. I highly recommend this course if you need an honors seminar.",2107
iso-ahola,3,B,KNES442,"If you don't like to review 300 pages of journal articles, do not take this class. Each hw assignment is pages and pages of reading and highlighting. Concepts I thought were going to be cool are really just boring theories, thus the class is boring, and the paper you have to write for this class is the worst I've had to do in my college career. Tests were extremely hard but are at least curved. If you thought this was going to be like knes350 or knes451, stop. Sign up for something else. ",2107
iso-ahola,5,A,HONR258O,"Dr. Seppo is a great professor. He truly cares about his students, and doesn't care whether you are a novice or experienced golfer. The quizzes are difficult at first, but if you do the reading, they are manageable. The midterm and finals are rough, but if you actually read the material a few times you will be fine.
The best part about the course is getting the chance to play golf. You will spend the the first half of the semester on the driving range and then you will get to play one or two rounds of golf before going into the classroom when the weather gets cold. 
Dr. Seppo can be a genuinely funny guy, and he always seems to be in a good mood. Though some of the inside material can be boring, the first half of the semester more than makes up for it, and I still found myself willing to come to class everyday.",2107
iso-ahola,5,A,HONR258O,"I'd definitely agree with everything the other reviewers said. If you've never taken golf before, it's perfectly fine. Dr. Iso-Ahola grades the newbies on a different scale for the skill exam, and doesn't expect you to know the terminology right away. The quizzes are NOT easy, but once you get used to the kind of questions he asks, it's not so bad. More work than I expected for an Honors seminar about golf, but learning golf makes up for it. ",2107
iso-ahola,5,B,HONR258O,"This was a really fun and interesting honors seminar. Your grade depends on:

 - Journal entries (twice a week entries)
 - 6 papers (4 thought papers, 2 book reviews)
 - Skills tests (iron shots, wood shots, putting, etc)
 - 1 midterm
 - 1 final exam

You get a thick reading packet, but the readings are fairly easy to read (except, maybe, some of the scientific articles). A great thing about this honors seminar is the chance to go out to Paint Branch Golf Course and go play 9 holes. It really is an exhilarating experience.

For the first half of the semester, you practice your shots at the UMD Driving Range; the second half of the semester is in the class learning about the motor, psychological, and other aspects of golf.

Dr. Iso-Ahola is very fair grader, easily approachable, and open to any comments, suggestions, questions, etc. Although not exactly an easy A class, it is a fun, and unique, Honors seminar. If you have experience in golf or are interesting in learning something about golf, take this seminar.",2107
iso-ahola,5,A,HONR258O,"This class was incredibly fun.  Where else can you play golf for college credit?  There was a huge reading packet, weekly journals, six papers, and two books, but all of it was not difficult at all, as long as you did the work.  It may sound like alot, but the course covers everything from social issues to biomechanics to history of golf, and you get to learn to play as well.  Iso-Ahola was very helpful and open to students, and definitely enjoys getting to know everyone.  He has been a reference for me in the past, and has also been willing to write recommendations even though I am not a Kinesiology major.  If you are in Honors, and are interested in learning about golf, take this class.  I enjoyed every bit of it.",2107
iso-ahola,3,A-,HONR258O,"Professor Ahola is the man. Very nice guy if you get on his good side, and very personable as you get to know him more. At first, with his accent, it may be a bit tough, but over time you can build a great relationship with him. This Honors seminar was a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. If you are looking for an easy A seminar without a lot of work, look elsewhere. there is a large reading packet for between classes, journal to be written by hand after each class, many quizzes at the start of classes, 5-6 papers, 2 books, a midterm, and a final. the midterm and final are pretty tough, quizzes are very hit or miss, the journal and papers are not very hard as long as you meet the length requirements and put in minimal effort. you will get a feel for the class as the semester goes on. overall, the first 6-7 weeks you meet at the driving range and hit balls, and play 9 holes twice, making the class one of a kind. Its not easy, but definitely an enjoyable experience most of the time.",2107
iso-ahola,4,A,HONR258O,"I definitely recommend this honors seminar, not because it’s easy but because it will teach you so much. I was kind of mad when I realized it doesn’t fulfill any gen eds,  but I am glad I took this class. It wasn’t easy, that’s for sure. For the first part of the semester, class would be at the golf course. Kind of a trek over there, and Seppo would never cancel for weather unless the golf course closed.  When you get to class there would be a quiz waiting for you on the readings that were assigned the last class. There was so much to read! Most of those quizzes were tough but they don’t count much towards the final grade. The rest of class we learned how to golf. Definitely a one of a kind experience. Seppo can be gruff at times, but he is an excellent teacher. I went from never swinging a golf club before to being able to drive and putt pretty well. It is definitely a good life skill to have. When the weather got colder we finished golfing and had class inside. That was more boring but we learned so much from psychology to physics to philosophy. We did have to read 2 books, write 5 4-6 page papers, and had a midterm and a final. But the small class size (10 people) definitely helped us bond with each other and Seppo. He brought us food on the last day! He is really a nice and interesting fellow once you get to meet him. He’ll joke around with us but was sometimes partial to the guys and treated the girls a little differently (he’s kind of old school that way). Overall loved him and his class",2107
jette,5,A,KNES293,"Super nice and helpful teacher! I think she made the class so interesting and genuinely put in the effort to make sure students understood the material and its importance outside of the classroom. The two papers really weren't that bad, and I was really fascinated with the topics so I liked doing them. Would definitely recommend. ",2108
desmond,5,,HLTH391,"Dr. Desmond is an amazing professor who really cares about her students and wants them to do well. She's very easy to talk to and she keeps the class entertaining. She has so much experience in the field so she knows what she is talking about and she can make the information clear by giving multiple examples. She is super funny and goofy, but that's what makes the class so entertaining! It's definitely one of those classes you actually look forward to attending because of her. Granted, her exams (1 midterm and 1 final) are pretty difficult because it doesn't just require memorization. You have to know your stuff and be able to apply it for any situation. Her exam format is multiple choice, short answer, fill in the blank and definitions, and 1 long essay. I suggest starting to study for exams WAY before the actual exam day. Other points (the health fair, poster presentation, timely topic, etc.) help make up for points though.",2109
desmond,4,A,HLTH130,"This course is pretty easy.  Dr. Desmond posts the slides (usually, so just take general notes too), but only after class. She is sometimes unclear as to what she wants you to memorize, so I would read the assigned chapters before the exam and make sure you can answer all of the questions on the study guide.  ",2109
desmond,3,A+,HLTH285,"The class is really good! I didn't really talk to Dr.Desmond much since the whole online class was asynchronous, but she was nice in the emails I have received from her. Her grading of the writing assignments is very fair, as long as you answer every part of the question or prompt. The only downside was that the in-class assignments in the powerpoints were HARD to find and easily missed. Also if she says some is ""extra credit"", it really isn't and it WILL count towards your grade if you don't do it. ",2109
ranadive,1,A,,awful teacher. Not helpful at all. I would email him constantly asking for advice and he would never help. Take any other teacher besides him. I feel like he over complicates concepts so much so that its making me question things i already know.
